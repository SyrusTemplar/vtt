<p class="f">Cuprilachs&rsquo;re the spies, assassins, and secret soldiers of the <a href="rilmaniec97.html?rilmani">rilmani</a>. The <a href="rilmarge13a1.html?rilmarge">argenachs</a> act as advisers, and the <a href="rilmferr58bd.html?rilmferr">ferrumachs</a> stand bravely on the field of battle, but the cuprilachs strike from the shadows using stealth and speed to accomplish their goals. Cuprilachs believe that the only way the Balance&rsquo;ll ever be safe is by neutralizing high-up creatures of extreme alignment. They&rsquo;re easily the most dangerous rilmani, simply because they&rsquo;re the ones who&rsquo;re most likely to decide on the spot that a basher needs to be lost.</p>

<p>Cuprilachs appear as slight and wiry humans, with the easy grace and trim build of an <a href="elfaab4.html?elf">elf</a> or <a href="elfaab4.html?elf">half-elf</a>. Their features are human enough, except for the coppery sheen of their skins and their featureless, ruby-red eyes. There aren&rsquo;t many bloods in the Outlands who&rsquo;re as cocky or arrogant as a cuprilach, but their attitude stems from a professional pride &mdash; they&rsquo;re some of the best assassins on the planes, and they know it.</p>

<p>While cuprilachs make no secret o their calling or beliefs in the rilmani strongholds of the Spire, they&rsquo;re extremely capable and clever spies when they&rsquo;re about their business. They&rsquo;ll use their <i>polymorph self</i> ability to great effect, and consider no ruse, charade, or dirty trick to be beneath them when there&rsquo;s work to be done. It&rsquo;s said that no one&rsquo;s ever spotted a cuprilach before he struck, but this is an exaggeration&hellip; probably.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Cuprilachs don&rsquo;t fight fair. They&rsquo;re killers, not warriors, and they do whatever it takes to silence the opposition quickly and efficiently. Cuprilachs&rsquo;re fond of striking with two coppery <i>short swords +2</i> in melee combat. The cuprilach&rsquo;s native grace and speed confers quickness to his hand-to-hand attacks, and he always attacks first in a round. Cuprilachs have a Strength of 18/76 despite their slight build and agility. They also use special <i>throwing stars +1</i> with a range of 50 feet. The stars return if they miss. A word of caution: Don&rsquo;t assume that an unarmed cuprilach ain&rsquo;t dangerous. They&rsquo;re skilled martial artists and wrestlers who can strike twice per round for 1d8 points of damage even without their weapons.</p>

<p>Cuprilachs can perform all thief functions, including backstabbing, as if they were 12th-level thieves. They command the following spell-like abilities: <i>charm person</i>, <i>delude</i>, <i>detect invisibility</i>, <i>enervation</i> (2 levels), <i>ESP</i>, <i>fog cloud</i>, <i>forget</i>, <i>improved invisibility</i>, <i>poison</i>, and <i>wraithform</i>. Once per day a cuprilach can create a fan-shaped spray of acid 20 feet long and 10 feet wide that causes 5d4+5 points of damage to any creature who fails a saving throw versus spell.</p>

<p>Cuprilachs can be damaged only by +2 or better weapons. Once per day they may attempt to <i>gate</i> in 1d3 more cuprilachs with a 40% chance of success.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Cuprilachs rank below argenachs and above the ferrumachs and <a href="_linke941e941.html?rilmabio">abiorachs</a> in the society of the Spire. They&rsquo;re hardly model citizens, though. Cuprilachs&rsquo;re hot-tempered, violent, and rebellious at the best of times. Despite this, they never refuse a target and serve to the best of their ability when an <a href="rilmauru01f2.html?rilmauru">aurumach</a> tells &rsquo;em to put some cutter under.</p>

<p>When cuprilachs aren&rsquo;t on the job, they&rsquo;re often pursuing rigorous training and driving themselves at a brutal pace, or tearing up the Spire in wild celebration. Other rilmani stay out of their way when cuprilachs get together and &ldquo;relax&rdquo;.</p>
