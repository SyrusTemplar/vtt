<p class="f">Looking like a dusky blue armored caterpillar, the garigal (ga-REE-jall) is the most puzzling of the <a href="_linkdbf0dbf0.html?garradal">garradalaighs</a> because of its mode of travel. Though it moves quickly over nearly any type of terrain, it has no legs. It has a magical means of propulsion and a magical quality to its coat that gives it a remarkable Armor Class.</p>

<p>The garigal has eyes like black diamonds that are starkly visible amid its pale scale, and a shiny black, twitching nose extending nearly a foot away from its body.</p>

<p>The creature can communicate telepathically with any spellcaster. In addition, it can speack to insects. A wizard in the company of a garigal gains the ability to communicate with insects, too, as long as the garigal is within 60 yards.</p>

<p>The garigal can turn <i>invisible</i> at will, though it must be visible to use its gaze attack, release spells, or attack physically. In addition, it can use the following clerical abilities once a day, as if at 9th level: <i>cure light wounds</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, <i>detect poison</i>, <i>detect snares and pits</i>, <i>pass without trace</i>, <i>detect charm</i>, <i>trip</i>, <i>meld into stone</i>, <i>summon insects</i>.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> This garradalaigh uses <i>invisibility</i> to help it attack with surprise. The creature attacks physically with a long, whiplike tongue that is rough to the touch and coated with a slimy substance that inflicts 3d6 points of damage. The slimy fluid destroys nonmagical leather and cloth in 1d6 rounds. The garigal uses its <i>trip</i> and <i>summon insects</i> abilities to keep targets off guard.</p>

<p>The creature&rsquo;s most formidable weapon is its gaze. It has two distinct gaze attacks, each usable once a day and each with a cone-shaped effect that measures 1 foot wide at the creature&rsquo;s face, 90 feet long, and 60 feet wide at the end. One gaze attack strikes all those in the area of effect with the equivalent of a <i>shatter</i> spell. The second attack acts as a <i>ray of enfeeblement</i>, as if cast by a 7th-level wizard. Often, after using the first gaze attack in battle, the garigal scurries among its victims, lapping up any traces of potions that were kept in now-shattered containers.</p>

<p>Although the garigal does not go looking for fights, it is perhaps the most eager of the garradalaighs to do battle.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> It is said that the garigal seems to enjoy the company of human wizards more than that of <a href="elfhalf539f.html?elfhalf">half-elf</a> or <a href="elfaab4.html?elf">elf</a> wizards. Legends most commonly place it in the swamplands of eastern Anuire and western Khinasi.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> The garigal is a vegetarian, preferring rotted plants to living ones and snacking on decaying bits of logs. However, it it is hungry it will eat live plants. And, like several other garradalaighs, it adores imbibing all manner of magical elixiers.</p>
