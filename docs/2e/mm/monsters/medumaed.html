  <h2>Maedar</h2>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b>  Maedar attack with powerful fists that each cause 2d4 points of damage. One every three turns, the maedar can <i>turn stone to flesh</i> by touch. Maedar can pass through stone at their normal movement rate. They require one round of concentration before this; no other activity can be undertaken that round. Maedar struck by a <i>phase door</i> spell while passing through stone are killed instantly.</p>

<p>Maedar are immune to petrifaction and paralyzation (including related spells, such as <i>hold</i> and <i>slow</i>). They are immune to the poisonous bite of a medusa&rsquo;s serpentine hair. In addition, maedar can see into and extend their <i>stone into flesh</i> power into the Astral and Ethereal planes.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Maedar are the little-known male version of the medusae. They are extremely rare, however (far more rare than the frequency would indicate), and few medusae ever find a maedar spouse.</p>

<p>Most medusae typically mate with human males. This cross produces two to six eggs that hatch into fledgling, human-like females, who mature into medusae. The cross insures the continuation of the medusae species.</p>

<p>When a medusa finds and mates with the extremely rare maedar, the eggs hatch into human infants, 25% male and 75% female. Only 1% of the males born of these matings are actually maedar; the remaining males and all the females are normal human infants who die at the sight of their mother.</p>

<p>The typical maedar is a monogamist who mates for life; he is fiercely devoted to his mate and will go to any length to assist or avenge her. A widowed maedar will pursue his mate&rsquo;s killer for years.</p>

<p>Because of the Maedar&rsquo;s rarity and natural reclusiveness, even most sages are unaware of their existence. Maedar are rarely seen; generally they remain in the lair they share with a medusa mate. A maedar&rsquo;s magical power provides food for him and his mate. He smashes her petrified victims, then transforms them into meat.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Maedar may cooperate with lawful evil creatures, such as <a href="_link225f225f.html?kobold">kobolds</a> and <a href="orc8f5d.html?orc">orcs</a>, in exchange for security or reward. If forced to aid another creature, maedar seek revenge at the first opportunity.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Glyptar</b></p>
<p class="ni">Glyptars are rock crystals animated by the spirits of maedar. When a maedar has foreknowledge of his death, he can transfer his life force into the rocks. An extremely evil maedar retains his consciousness as it drifts through the ground. When such a life force encounters gemstones, such as feldspar or amethyst, it is trapped within and cannot leave voluntarily. Eventually the maedar goes mad. (Note that once a maedar is trapped within a glyptar crystal, his life force cannot be trapped in a second crystal.)</p>

<p>If this glyptar is removed intact from the ground, the maedar&rsquo;s spirit is now able to animate the crystal and anything inorganic attached to it. Thus if the glyptar is set in the eye of a stone statue, the maedar&rsquo;s life force animates it as a <a href="golem6265.html?golem">golem</a>. This can affect a maximum of 1,000 pounds.</p>

<p>Similarly, if the glyptar is set in the pommel of a sword, the sword can be animated to strike as though it were wielded by the living maedar. The weapon gains a +1 bonus to its attack roll, strikes as if it were wielded by a 6th-level fighter, and gains a +2 bonus to its damage roll. Note that the glyptar&rsquo;s <i>stone to flesh</i> power enables the weapon to sink harmlessly into stone as the glyptar uses its power.</p>

<p>The glyptar retains its other powers as well. The glyptar and its attachments may pass through stone at will at the normal movement rate. It is immune to <i>phase door</i> spells. Once every three turns the glyptar can perform a <i>stone to flesh</i> attack against a target touched by the glyptar or its setting. Glyptars remain immune to paralyzation and petrification attacks of all sorts.</p>
