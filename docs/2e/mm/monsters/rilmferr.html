<p class="f">When the <a href="rilmaniec97.html?rilmani">rilmani</a> are moved to take direct action in the cause of neutrality, it&rsquo;s the ferrumachs who answer the call of duty. They&rsquo;re the soldiers of the Spire, the iron legions who wait to serve in battle whenever and wherever they&rsquo;re needed. Ferrumachs&rsquo;ve got no existence or purpose beyond soldiering, and patiently await their next call to battle in misty halls on the slopes of the Spire.</p>

<p>Ferrumachs resemble tall, grim-faced humans. They are very powerfully muscled, with deep chests, wide shoulders, and thick arms. There&rsquo;s no hint of grace, athleticism, or agility about them; ferrumachs are walking slabs of stone. Their skin is a sooty gray &mdash; the color of bare iron, with an elusive gun-metal gleam when struck by the light.</p>

<p>Ferrumachs wear heavy suits of dark, spiked plate armor. Their powerful builds allow them to wear armor of unusual strength and weight. Halberds, two-handed axes, and great flails are popular among their ranks.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Physical conflict is the forte of the ferrumachs, and they&rsquo;ll not hesitate to wade into any battle that concerns the cause of neutrality. Ferrumachs&rsquo;re extremely strong, with a Strength of 19, and they&rsquo;re quite skilled with their weapon of choice. Because of this specialization, ferrumachs attack 3 times per 2 rounds (once in the first round, twice in the second, once in the third, and so on) with their <i>halberds</i> or <i>axes +1</i>. If disarmed, ferrumachs can still strike for 1d3+7 points of damage with their heavy, armored fists.</p>

<p>Since fenumachs exist to solve problems through physical combat, their spell-like abilities are minimal compared to those of other rilmani. Once per round, they can use the powers of <i>blur</i>, <i>detect invisibility</i>, <i>silence 15&rsquo; radius</i>, and <i>wall of fog</i>. Three times per day, a fenumach can <i>dispel magic</i> or create an <i>ice storm</i>. Fenumachs can <i>lay on hands</i> once per day, which <i>cures disease</i>, <i>neutralizes poison</i>, and heals up to 18 points of damage.</p>

<p>Fenumachs can be struck only by +1 or better weapons. They can gate in 2 to 8 more ferrumachs or 1 <a href="rilmarge13a1.html?rilmarge">argenach</a> with a chance of success equal to 10% for every ferrumach who participates in the summoning.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> As the soldiers of the rilmani, the ferrumachs hold themselves ready for action at any time. They don&rsquo;t mix with the other rilmani, living apart in gray fortresses and towers that watch over the Spire with unending vigilance. The ferrumachs&rsquo;re the most lawful of the rilmani, and obey the argenachs and <a href="rilmauru01f2.html?rilmauru">aurumachs</a> without hesitation. They&rsquo;re also on good terms with the <a href="rilmcuprfeee.html?rilmcupr">cuprilachs</a>, whom they regard as fellow fighters and professionals.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s said that the ferrumachs are created from the spirits of warriors  who died fighting in lost causes, but this ain&rsquo;t true. They&rsquo;re rilmani, just like the rest of their kind, and they&rsquo;ve always been that way.</p>
