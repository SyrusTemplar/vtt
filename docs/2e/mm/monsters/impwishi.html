<p class="f">The wishing <a href="_link72bb72bb.html?imp">imp</a> is an imp that has assumed the form of a small statuette. It grants wishes to its owner, though these are always twisted and perverted to evil in some way. When alone with its master, the imp may move around and even fly, but usually remains completely still, with a lifeless appearance on its face when around others.</p>

<p>The wishing imp looks like a small, deep black, bat-winged figurine with a slender, barbed tail. It has pointed ears, granitelike skin and a set of small horns. Strangely, its face is quite attractive, looking like that of an innocent child, with appealing deep brown eyes and a sweet smile.</p>

<p>The wishing imp communicates telepathically, but will seldom speak to anyone except their owner. Language does not appear to be a barrier to conversation with this sinister creature.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Luckily, the wishing imp is not usually met in combat. When called upon to fight, this deadly creature uses the barb on its tail against its foes. Though this stinger does only 1-2 points of damage, those struck by it must save vs. death magic or contract a disease that is fatal in 2d4 days unless cured through magical healing.</p>

<p>The wishing imp is completely resistant to all types of magic and cannot be hit by any weapons, mundane or magical, unless they are made of stone. Flint or obsidian arrowheads, throwing stones, sling stones, stone-tipped clubs, even swords pried from the hands of statues will all harm the imp, doing a maximum of 1d4 points of damage with each successful hit. When the imp takes enough damage to kill it, it falls and shatters, only to reforms within 24 hours and return to its owner.</p>

<p>The only way to rid oneself of the wishing imp is to sell it or give it away. In either case, the new owner of the imp cannot be deceived about the powers of the creature. He must be told that the item he is receiving will grant him wishes, but that these will come only at a dire cost. Of course, many are those who feel that they can escape the dreadful power of the imp. They long to see their wishes granted and are certain that no ill effects will befall them. Indeed, it is the avarice of man that seems to delight and somehow sustain this mysterious imp.</p>

<p>For some unknown reason, the wishing imp is anchored to the misty domains of Ravenloft. If its owner somehow escapes from the Demiplane of Dread, the creature will be left behind. Since it still belongs to that person, however, it will do whatever it can to draw its master back into Ravenloft.</p>

<p>The wishing imp can only be slain by a stone weapon that has been specially blessed by a priest for just that purpose. The person landing the blow that destroys the wishing imp will earn himself the creature&rsquo;s dying spell, a foul enchantment that is the equivalent of a lethal curse. The exact nature of this wizardry will be tailored to the individual upon whom it is cast.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Though it might seem a great benefit when first acquired, the wishing imp is soon exposed as a truly horrific creature. The imp is able to grant its owner one <i>wish</i> each day, subject to the normal limitations of that spell as described in the Player&rsquo;s Handbook, but these are always perverted in some fashion. Usually, the spell causes the loss of something very dear (whether an item or a person) to the one wishing even as it grants the actual <i>wish</i>. Furthermore, it tries to fulfill the <i>wish</i> in such a way that it creates a need for its owner to request more <i>wishes</i>, most often in an attempt to undo something an earlier <i>wish</i> caused.</p>

<p>The only way to rid oneself of the wishing imp without incurring more trouble is to escape from Ravenloft, sell it to someone, or give it to someone who willingly takes possession of it.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> The wishing imp is a magical creature of unknown origin. Since it first appeared in Ravenloft some centuries ago, however, the fiend has caused nothing but heartache and misery. Passed from owner to owner, it has been in every domain or island at one time of another.</p>

<p>For some reason, it seems impossible for the wishing imp to leave the Demiplane of Dread. Countless theories have been put forth to explain this, but none has been substantiated to date.</p>
