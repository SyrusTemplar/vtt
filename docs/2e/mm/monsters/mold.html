<p class="f">Molds are a variety of spore-producing <a href="fungus.html">fungi</a> that form in decaying food or in warm, moist places. These fungi usually have a woolly or furry texture. While most molds are harmless, there are (<a href="mold2.html">at least</a>) three varieties of monstrous molds that pose a deadly threat to adventurers: brown, russet, and yellow mold.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Brown Mold</b></p>
<p class="ni">Brown mold is found in damp subterranean areas, such as caverns and caves. It is light to golden brown in color. Brown mold feeds by absorbing heat, even body heat; where brown mold grows, the temperature is below average. Direct sunlight or ultraviolet light kills it.</p>

<p>If a warm-blooded creature comes within 5 feet of a brown mold, the mold drains heat equal to 4d8 points of damage from its victim, per round. A <i>ring of warmth</i> provides complete protection against this attack. Brown mold grows instantly from heat. If a torch is used in its vicinity, it doubles in size; if flaming oil is used, it quadruples, and fireball-type spells cause it to grow eight-fold.</p>

<p>Brown mold is not fed by cold light sources (e.g., <i>light</i>, <i>faerie fire</i>). The only magic that affects it are <i>disintegrate</i> (which destroys it), plant-affecting magic, and cold spells. Ice storms or walls of ice cause it to go dormant for 5d6 turns. A <i>cold wand</i>, <a href="toadgian.html">ice toads</a>, etc.</p>

<p></p>

<p class="f"><b>Russet Mold</b></p>
<p class="ni">Russet mold is golden-brown to rust red in color. It has a lumpy texture similar to cold porridge; it is covered by short, hair-like growths that stand upright and wave as if they were in a cold breeze. It resembles rust at distances beyond 30 feet (70% chance of error). It is immune to weapons and most spells; it is affected only by alcohol, acid, and salt, which kill it; a <i>cure disease</i> or a <i>continual light</i> spell also destroys it.</p>

<p>Russet mold continuously emits a cloud of spores in a three-foot radius. All creatures in this cloud suffer 5d4 points of damage (per round in the cloud) and must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or become infected with spore sickness. Victims of spore sickness are instantly paralyzed and die in 5d4 minutes unless a <i>cure disease</i> spell is cast on them.</p>

<p>Anyone who dies from spore sickness undergoes a transformation and begins to sprout russet mold growths; when completely covered in mold (1d4+20 hours), he becomes a <a href="moldman.html">mold man</a>. A <i>hold plant</i> spell will halt the growth of the mold for the duration of the spell, while a <i>cure disease</i> spell destroys it within an hour after death; after that, a <i>wish</i> is necessary to destroy it.</p>

<p class="ni"><b>Telepathy &mdash;</b> <i>Sciences:</i> nil; <i>Devotions:</i> mind wipe, id insinuation.</p>

<p class="ni"><b>Metapsionics &mdash;</b> <i>Sciences:</i> nil; <i>Devotion:</i> psionic sense.</p>

<p class="ni">Psionic sense: 1d100+20&rsquo; range, no cost.<br>Only sentient yellow molds (1 in 6 chance) have psionic powers. Such creatures are also immune to psionic attacks unless the creature is being aided by one who can communicate with plants.<br><br></p>
  <br>
<p class="ni">This mold is pale yellow to golden orange in color. If touched roughly, it may (50% chance) emit a cloud of spores in a 10-foot radius. Any creature caught in this cloud must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or die. A <i>cure disease</i> spell and a <i>resurrection</i> spell within 24 hours are necessary to restore life.</p>

<p>Fire of any sort destroys yellow mold. A <i>continual light</i> spell renders it dormant for 2d6 turns.</p>

<p>Yellow mold colonies of over 300 square feet are sometimes sentient (1 in 6 chance). These molds sense creatures within 60 feet, and may project their spores that distance. Twice per day, they may use a <i>suggestion</i> on someone within that radius; in addition to the saving throw, the victim must successfully roll an Intelligence check or lose 1 point of Intelligence permanently (it is devoured by the mold).</p>
