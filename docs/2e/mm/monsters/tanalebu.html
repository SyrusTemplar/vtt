<p class="f">Bulezau <a href="tanarri706b.html?tanarri">tanar&rsquo;ri</a> are born and bred to fight in the Blood War. With the exception of the <a href="_link957d957d.html?tanatvro">vrocks</a>, bulezau are the toughest front-line troops of the tanar&rsquo;ri hordes. Bulezau are used as heavy infantry, assault leaders, and personal guards; they lack the mobility or magical prowess of a similar band of vrocks, but they&rsquo;re strong and fearless bashers who&rsquo;re too stubborn and stupid to ever give up.</p>

<p>A bulezau resembles a <a href="_link63c163c1.html?minotaur">minotaur</a>, but it&rsquo;s gaunt and skeletal, and its flesh is filthy and diseased. The creature isn&rsquo;t covered with fur, but instead with patches of wiry bristles over battered, boil-covered skin. Its feet are clawed, not hoofed, and it has a long, serpentine tail with a clump of iron-hard spines at its end. The bulezau&rsquo;s horns and head are more ramlike than bull-like, and its mouth is filled with small, needle-sharp fangs. Bulezau are often armed with great tridents, pole arms, or morning stars of wicked design.</p>

<p>Bulezau can speak the common trade-jargon of the planes with difficulty or communicate with a weak form of telepathy at will. It&rsquo;s a good idea for a cutter to make out like he understands the bulezau perfectly no matter how animallike its speech is, since it&rsquo;s not a patient basher. If a bulezau decides it&rsquo;s easier to tear the arms off a sod than talk to him it won&rsquo;t wait long to act on its impulses.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Bulezau are built for a fight. They can deal out raw damage just as well as many kinds of greater or true tanar&rsquo;ri, but their chief vulnerability&rsquo;s found in the hollow space between their ears. Strategy, discipline, and common sense&rsquo;ve got no lace in the world of a bulezau, and if there&rsquo;s anything dumber than a bulezau, it&rsquo;s two of &rsquo;em together. &rsquo;Course, strength and energy&rsquo;ll make up for a lot of failings of strategy, and that&rsquo;s an approach bulezau are happy to take.</p>

<p>Like all tanar&rsquo;ri, bulezau suffer no damage from nonmagical fire, electricity, or poison. Cold, magical fire, and gas cause only half damage to a bulezau.</p>

<p>Unarmed bulezau strike with each of their clawed forelimbs for 1d4+1 points of damage, deliver a powerful head-butt for 2d8 points of damage, and lash out with their bristly tails for another 1d3 points of damage. If the bulezau rolls a natural 19 or 20 with its head-butt, it knocks a man-size or smaller opponent back 5 to 10 feet (d6+4) and stuns the sod for 1 to 3 rounds. If the bulezau&rsquo;s armed, it substitutes the weapon attack for its claw attacks. Bulezau weapons&rsquo;re huge (size H) and inflict double normal damage, +6 for the creature&rsquo;s Strength. A bulezau fighting with a morning star&rsquo;ll do 4d4+6 points of damage with a hit. The bulezau can also butt and lash with its tail in the same round.</p>

<p>Once a bulezau&rsquo;s in a fight, it&rsquo;s likely to go berserk. There&rsquo;s a 25% chance each round that it goes on a rampage of destruction, refusing to stop until either it or its opponent is dead. This rises to a 75% chance in a round in which bulezau takes damage without managing to hit its foe. (They don&rsquo;t take failure well.) A berserk bulezau&rsquo;s Armor Class falls to 1, since it ignores any defensive tactics whatsoever, but it gains a +2 bonus to all attack rolls. While berserk, the bulezau gains a +4 bonus to its saving throws versus any fear, emotion, or mind-affecting spells, including <i>hold monster</i> and the like. The bulezau doesn&rsquo;t recover from its rage until all opponents are dead, routed, or the bulezau&rsquo;s been unable to engage in melee for 5 rounds or more.</p>

<p>In addition to the powers common to all tanar&rsquo;ri, bulezau can use the following spell-like abilities (at will unless otherwise specified) at the 7th level of ability: <i>cause fear</i>, <i>command</i>, <i>detect invisibility</i>, <i>shout</i> (1/day), and <i>wall of fog</i>. Bulezau can be injured only by cold iron or weapons of +1 or better value. Once per day they can attempt to <i>gate</i> 1 to 3 <a href="tanalaru863d.html?tanalaru">rutterkin</a> (40%) or 3 to 12 <a href="_link3b5c3b5c.html?tanaladr">dretches</a> (60%) with a 25% chance of success.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Bulezau are quarrelsome, bullying creature that often fall into lethal disagreements with each other. Only the authority of a powerful greater or true tanar&rsquo;ri can keep them from each other&rsquo;s throats, and even then only if the promise of battle is near. Bulezau live for combat, and regard all other activities as a waste of time. They make poor pickets, sentries, or scouts since they&rsquo;ve got no patience for waiting around or attempts at stealth &mdash; if a bulezau sees an enemy, it charges, and if it doesn&rsquo;t see an enemy, it goes looking for one.</p>

<p>Bulezau may be difficult troops to keep control of, but they&rsquo;re very good at what they do. Once committed to a battle, they hold nothing back and plunge into the thick of the fight with reckless abandon. For a tanar&rsquo;ri commander, the bulezau are a slavering band of maniacs that&rsquo;ll attempt any attack and never retreat, no matter how long the odds are. Loyalty of that kind is hard to find in the Abyss, even if it&rsquo;s uncontrollable bloodlust instead of iron discipline.</p>

<p>Tanar&rsquo;ri commanders&rsquo;ve long recognized that it&rsquo;s a good idea to keep bulezau near the war front. They&rsquo;re just too stupid and aggressive to remain in a noncombat situation for long.</p>

<p>With a strong and charismatic commander, bulezau can hold themselves in check &mdash; just barely. High-ups in the Abyss sometimes create a ruthless and fanatical guard of bulezau, deciding that it&rsquo;s worth the headaches to have such capable and loyal (for tanar&rsquo;ri) fighters at their back and call.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> It&rsquo;s rumored that the tanar&rsquo;ri lord Baphomet, the patron demipower of minotaurs, was responsible for the creation of the bulezau. The chant goes that Baphomet bred his minotaur servants with some of the tanar&rsquo;ri in his service, but there&rsquo;s no way to know if this&rsquo;s a peel or not. It&rsquo;s also said that Baphomet maintains a bodyguard of fierce bulezau of unusual loyalty and discipline.</p>

<p>Bulezau are generally well-regarded by tanar&rsquo;ri of higher station, since bulezau pursue the Blood War with so much enthusiasm that a more subtle tanar&rsquo;ri can drop out of sight when they&rsquo;re around. Tanar&rsquo;ri commanders place a high value on bulezau formations and go out of their way to gather such units when possible. On the other hand, less powerful tanar&rsquo;ri rarely want to be anywhere near a bulezau since the creature&rsquo;s likely to fly off into a murderous rage at the least provocation, regardless of the consequence. There&rsquo;ve been engagements where more dretches and rutterkin were lost to bulezau impatience than to <a href="baatezufb61.html?baatezu">baatezu</a> action.</p>

<p>Bulezau&rsquo;ve got a bitter rivalry with vrocks, and encounters between the two almost always break out into a fight unless there are baatezu nearby to deal with.</p>
