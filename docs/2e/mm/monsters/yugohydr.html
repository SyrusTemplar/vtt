<p class="f">Hydroloths are elite fighting forces commonly used in <a href="yugolothe8f9.html?yugoloth">yugoloth</a> ambushes or amphibian attacks. They are squat humanoids with underarm gliding flaps, frog-like faces, and warty yellow skin.</p>

<p>These grotesque amphibians can swim the river Styx without losing their memories. They travel in groups of 10 or more wherever Styx enters the Lower Planes.</p>

<p>Hydroloths communicate using telepathy.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Hydroloths usually attack with two claws (1d8 damage each) and bite (1d10 damage). While gliding, they can also attack with two foot claws (ld4 damage each). Hydroloths gleefully attack anything they feel they can easily defeat, but are cowardly against equal or superior forces.</p>

<p>Hydroloths can spit a stream of foul yellow liquid from a gland under their tongues (1d10 damage and save vs. poison or fall asleep for 1-8 rounds). Before the poison wears off, the victim cannot be awakened save by magical means.</p>

<p>Like all yugoloths, hydroloths can <i>teleport without error</i> at will, and sometimes use a <i>dimension door</i> to gain altitude for a glide. In addition to those available to all yugoloths, hydroloths can use the following spell-like powers: <i>conjure elemental</i> (with limitations listed below), <i>create water</i>, <i>darkness, 15&rsquo; radius</i>, <i>dimension door</i>, and <i>water walk</i> (as a <i>ring of water walking</i>). Twice per day, they can attempt to <i>gate</i> in another hydroloth with a 50% chance of success.</p>

<p>The hydroloth&rsquo;s <i>conjure elemental</i> ability creates a 12 HD <a href="_linkc5e9c5e9.html?element2">water elemental</a> that fights for the hydroloth without control. This power only works in the presence of a large body of water.</p>

<p>Hydroloths take half damage from any water-based attack form (no damage if they save successfully). Hydroloths are harmed only by +1 or better weapons.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Hydroloths prefer to dwell in water, fire, or lava but can be found anywhere. The yugoloth community respects them for their role in amphibious and underwater warfare especially in covert and guerrilla attacks.</p>

<p>Hydroloths use their prestige among their betters to gain power and influence: extra wealth, or a share of the mortal life forces paid for the job they do. Greater yugoloths have the strength to force the hydroloths&rsquo; obedience, but they wisely appease these creatures&rsquo; demands.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Few yugoloths are motivated like the hydroloths. These monsters delight in fighting the Blood War and draw strength from the terror they inflict on mortals.</p>

<p>Several internal organs of hydroloths make excellent spell components and alchemical mixtures for potions. A live hydroloth, though extremely difficult to capture, might bring 2,500 gp on some parts of the Prime Material Plane or even (perhaps) in Sigil. A dead one, though not as valuable, still fetches upwards of 1,000 gp.</p>
