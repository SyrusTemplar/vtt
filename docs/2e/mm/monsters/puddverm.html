<p class="f">Vermilion pudding is the name given to an aggregate colony of the flesh-eating <a href="parasacodd3b.html?parasaco">vermilia bacteria</a>. The Red Curse has affected these colonies, imbuing them with the ability to act together as one creature.</p>

<p>The vermilion pudding glows with an eerie internal red light. It usually takes the form of a red-tinged amorphous blob, and like other puddings, it can change shape rapidly and flow through almost any opening. The pudding is extremely sticky and tarlike.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> In order to determine if something is edible, the vermilion pudding can sense heat and vibration from a distance of up to 90 feet. The vermilion pudding will even attack undead creatures that have organic matter in their bodies. The puddings count as +2 magical weapons for the purpose of eating undead or magical flesh.</p>

<p>Vermilion puddings prefer to attack Legacy-using creatures and will attack Inheritors before attacking those with a single Legacy.</p>

<p>Like all <a href="pudddead7301.html?pudddead">deadly puddings</a>, the vermilion pudding is immune to acid, cold, and poison. <i>Lightning bolts</i> and weapon attacks cause them to divide into smaller puddings, each able to attack as an individual pudding. Fire causes normal damage, as do <i>magic missiles</i>. Vermilion puddings can squeeze through very small cracks (such as the chinks and gaps in armor) and can travel on ceilings and walls.</p>

<p>All vermilion puddings are at least three feet in diameter. They have hit points in proportion to their size, roughly according to the following:</p>
  <table class="ip">
   <tr class="bk"><th>Diameter</th><th>Hit Points</th></tr>
   <tr><td>3&rsquo;</td><td>30</td></tr>
   <tr><td>4&rsquo;</td><td>40</td></tr>
   <tr><td>5&rsquo;</td><td>50</td></tr>
   <tr><td>6&rsquo;</td><td>60</td></tr>
   <tr><td>7&rsquo;</td><td>70</td></tr>
   <tr><td>8&rsquo;</td><td>80</td></tr>
  </table>

<p>The attack mode of the rapacious vermilion pudding is similar to that of the vermilia infection, except much faster. The pudding causes 1 point of damage the first round, 2 points the second round, 4 points the third round, 8 the fourth, (etc.). If the pudding successfully hits an opponent once, it automatically succeeds each subsequent round until it is destroyed.</p>

<p>Armor provides little protection from the vermilion pudding&rsquo;s attack since the pudding only has to touch its victim. All of its victims have a base of AC 10, although magical armor bonuses, magical protection such as a ring of protection, and dexterity bonuses are still applicable. Any form of metal armor will hold off the vermilion pudding for one round before the pudding finds a hole or a chink in the armor to flow through. The vermilion pudding does not eat the armor itself; it simply flows past it to get at the flesh beneath.</p>

<p>The vermilion pudding is mindless and will never retreat as long as there remains flesh to be eaten.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Vermilion puddings reproduce by fission. If a vermilion pudding reaches eight feet in diameter, it will split into two separate four-foot diameter puddings. They adapt to live in a wide variety of climates.</p>
