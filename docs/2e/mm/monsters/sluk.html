<p class="f">Sluk is wildspace seaweed, with the same ship-miring ability as sargasso seaweed in planetary seas. An unintelligent parasite, it feeds on magical energy.</p>

<p>Sluk is a dark blue weed with small silver nodules in its leaves. It drifts in 50&rsquo; long, stringy clumps called &ldquo;beds&rdquo;, waiting for ships to run into it. Its coloration acts as near-perfect camouflage in wildspace (only 5% chance that lookouts see it). In the phlogiston, the plant is easy to spot.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> If a spellcaster or anyone carrying three or more magical items falls into a sluk bed, the seaweed wraps itself around the victim. If it scores a hit, the sluk contracts with Strength 18 as it leeches magical energy, inflicting 1d6 damage per round. Draining effects on magical items are described below.</p>

<p>Sluk can mire spelljamming vessels. Each 50 square feet of sluk bed can stop five tons of vessel; the bed&rsquo;s area is 2d10×50 square feet.</p>

<p>If the vessel is moving at spelljamming speeds when it runs into a sluk bed big enough to stop it, the ship immediately decelerates to tactical speed, requiring all aboard to make a Dexterity check or lose their balance and fall. A vessel travelling at tactical speed through a sluk bed gradually slows to a halt, losing ¼ of its original speed and maneuverability each round until it stops.</p>

<p>Once a vessel stops in a sluk bed, the only way to get moving again is to chop away the strands. This takes 1d6+3 rounds.</p>

<p>Sluk is completely immune to magic, except for cold-based spells. Magical cold instantly causes the plant to shrivel up and flake off. Other spells merely nourish the sluk. If a total of 10 spell levels are cast at the sluk, it reproduces as detailed below.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Sluk is attracted to sources of magic and moves towards them much as a groundling sunflower turns to face the sun.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Sluk reproduces by adhering to a trapped spelljamming hull and bleeding its magical energy. The hull must be wood; metal hulls are immune to the bleeding, though they are still trapped.) Subtract the trapped vessel&rsquo;s SR from 10; the result is the number of rounds (minimum 1) the sluk must hold the ship motionless to reproduce. Thus, a vessel with SR 4 lets the plant reproduce in six rounds. Sluk can only bleed motionless ships.</p>

<p>In reproducing, the sluk doubles the size of its patch, possibly miring the ship even deeper in the bed. At DM&rsquo;s option, the crew must spend 1d6 extra rounds cutting away strands.</p>

<p><i>Drain effects:</i> The sluk temporarily reduces a trapped spelljammer&rsquo;s SR by 1 per round (minimum 1). Ignore this temporary reduction when figuring how long the sluk takes to reproduce; a1ways use the ship&rsquo;s original SR instead. The ship regains 1 SR per hour once it escapes from the sluk. Once a ship is reduced to SR 1, it no longer feeds the sluk enough energy to permit reproduction. At DM&rsquo;s discretion, spelljamming helms may lose their power permanently after months in the sluk.</p>

<p>Magical items lose one charge per round; permanent magical items lose their magic after one hour in the sluk, but recover their power within 1d10 turns if removed before then. Relics and artifads are not affected.</p>
