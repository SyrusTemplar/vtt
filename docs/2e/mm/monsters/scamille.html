<p class="f">Scamilles are amorphous, amoebalike creatures that can change their shapes. They dwell in subterranean areas and are related to <a href="ooslje01e787.html?ooslje01">ochre jellies</a>. Unlike ochre jellies, scamilles are intelligent and can camouflage themselves.</p>

<p>In their normal forms, scamilles resemble giant amoebas. Each has a black nucleus surrounded by a mass of rock-gray protoplasm. The protoplasm extrudes six pseudopods. A scamille has a slightly acidic odor, though the scamille does not attack with acid.</p>

<p>Scamilles use their pliable Form to create mouths. They can speak Common, which is their preferred language. Scamilles do not have their own language.</p>

<p>In general, scamilles are not aggressive. They will wait and observe a party to determine whether it is a threat. If a party is &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; (perhaps clever or eloquent), the scamilles will continue to watch for a while.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> When at rest, a scamille takes the form of some inanimate object such as a rock, door, wall, table, chair, or chest. Scamilles cannot take the form of living creatures. The ability to change shape is limited, and is not done through conscious effort; when tired, the scamille simply draws its body together. Each scamille can assume the form of only one inanimate object. Though the scamille can change color slightly, a close examination will reveal such an &ldquo;item&rdquo; to be suspect. A camouflaged scamille gives opponents a -1 penalty to surprise rolls.</p>

<p>Scamilles attack with their six pseudopods, each causing 3d6 points of damage.</p>

<p>A scamille can cause one pseudopod at a time to become sticky. IF a victim is successfully hit with the sticky pseudopod, it is stuck Fast. A stuck victim can attack only with a weapon that was already in hand at the time of the scamille&rsquo;s successful assault. A victim attacking in this fashion suffers a -4 penalty to attack rolls. Once a victim is held, the scamille attacks with the remaining five pseudopods, though these have no adhesive quality to them. Attacks on a held victim automatically hit. Spells that require material components cannot be used by a held victim.</p>

<p>In order to pull Free of the sticky pseudopod, the victim must make 2 successfull bend bars rolls. One attempt can be made per round, in place of any attacks the victim might wish to make.</p>

<p>A scamille can choose to let go of a stuck victim. Otherwise, a victim who fails its bend bars rolls can be freed only by an application of <i>oil of slipperiness</i> or the death of the scamille.</p>

<p>Once a victim dies, the scamille draws the victim&rsquo;s body into its own and secretes a powerful acid that dissolves the victim and all possessions in 1d4 rounds.</p>

<p>Scamilles are vulnerable to light. If a <i>light</i> spell is cast upon a scamille, it loses the ability to form pseudopods for one round. If cast on a camouflaged scamille, the <i>light</i> spell causes it to assume its amoebalike form.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Scamilles dwell in dark places such as caves and fissures. They rarely venture above ground, even at night.</p>

<p>Though scamilles can be found in small groups, there is no group mentaliy. Each scamille acts as it pleases, free of interference from its brethren.</p>

<p>Scamilles are asexual beings, dividing like amoeba once every five years or so, when enough raw material has been gathered to allow the split. A typical scamille lives 120 years.</p>

<p>Scamilles like to learn secrets, and because of their camouflage ability, they are in an ideal situation to eavesdrop on other underground dwellers.</p>

<p>When found in a good mood, a scamille may offer information in exchange for food. Howcver, scamilles are subject to profound mood swings.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Scamilles keep cavern floors clear of obstructions, especially absorbing the remains of intruders to the subterranean world.</p>

<p>In addition to animal and plant material, scamilles eat small quantities of minerals and rocks, and even derive some sustenance from the remains of a dead victim&rsquo;s equipment. Scamilles enjoy scraps of what humans and demihumans consider food. To a scamille, such scraps are a special taste treat.</p>
