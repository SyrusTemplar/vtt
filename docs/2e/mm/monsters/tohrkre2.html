<p class="f"><a href="tohrkre12704.html?tohrkre1">Tohr-kreen</a> are large, intelligent insects, very similar to <a href="thrikreecdcb.html?thrikree">thri-kreen</a>. Tohr-kreen build permanent settlements in the lands far to the north of the Tablelands, home to Tyr and the other humanoid city-states. For many years, the tohr-kreen have sent scouts to the Tyr region These scouts are called <i>zik-trin&rsquo;ta</i> by other tohr-kreen, but are known as tohr-kreen to the peoples of the Tablelands.</p>

<p>The most common tohr-kreen of the north are the j&rsquo;ez, who have black chitin, and the j&rsquo;hol, who are smaller and have red chitin. Members of both species have aggressive natures. Both are similar in most ways to thri-kreen.</p>
  <h2>J&rsquo;ez Tohr-kreen</h2>

<p class="f">The figures given above are for mature adult j&rsquo;ez. Others have the following abilities, based on their age (they age one age category every two years until they reach mature adult):</p>
  <table class="ip">
   <tr class="bk"><th></th><th>HD</th><th>THAC0</th><th>XP</th><th>Claw/bite Damage</th><th>Special Ability</th></tr>
   <tr><td>Larva</td><td>1+3</td><td>19</td><td>65</td><td>1/1d2</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Child</td><td>2+3</td><td>17</td><td>120</td><td>1/1d3</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Young</td><td>3+3</td><td>17</td><td>175</td><td>1d3/1d4</td><td>leap</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Young adult</td><td>4+3</td><td>15</td><td>270</td><td>1d3/1d6</td><td>venom</td></tr>

   <tr><td>Mature adult</td><td>6+3</td><td>13</td><td>1,400</td><td>1d4/1d6+1</td><td>dodge missiles</td></tr>
  </table>

<p>J&rsquo;ez have black chitin and four-fingered hands. Skin stretches over their chitin and they have long antennae. J&rsquo;ez also have mouths that are odd for kreen. The general arrangement is circular, and the j&rsquo;ez have inward-pointing fanglike parts around the circumference of their relatively flexible mouths. Extensions reach from the sides of the mouth and help secure food to be taken in by the &ldquo;fangs&rdquo;, which dispense the tohr-kreen&rsquo;s venom.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> J&rsquo;ez enjoy combat and war and are good military leaders. They prefer to use psionics against their opponents when possible, closing to melee when psionic attack is not an option. J&rsquo;ez prefer manufactured weapons, especially the gythka, that can slash for 1-6 (1d6) points of damage against targets of man-size or smaller, or for 1-10 (1d10) points of damage against a larger target. Like thri-kreen, j&rsquo;ez tohrkreen have a natural AC 5 because of their exoskeletons, and are immune to <i>hold person</i> and <i>charm person</i> spells. They learn other special abilities as they age.</p>

<p><i>Leap:</i> This ability allows j.ez to leap 20 feet straight up or 50 feet forward. They cannot leap backward.</p>

<p><i>Venom:</i> A bite delivers this venom. Anyone bitten must make a successful save vs. paralyzation or be paralyzed. Smaller than man-sized creatures are paralyzed for 2-10 (2d10) rounds, man-sized for 2-8 (2d8) rounds, large creatures for 1-8 (1d8) rounds, and huge and gargantuan creatures for 1 round.</p>

<p><i>Chatkcha:</i> J&rsquo;ez can throw two chatkcha per round, as far as 270 feet. A chatkcha causes 3-8 (1d6+2) points of damage when it hits, and returns to the thrower when it misses.</p>

<p><i>Dodge missiles:</i> Mature j&rsquo;ez can dodge missiles fired at them with a roll of 9 or better on 1d20; they cannot dodge magical effects, only physical missiles. Magical physical missiles (arrows, thrown axes) modify this roll by their magical bonus.</p>

<p><i>Psionics:</i> Many j&rsquo;ez (50%) are psionicists. The rest have psionic wild talents (see The Complete psionics Handbook).</p>

<p><i>Magical and psionic items:</i> J&rsquo;ez never use magical items, but all have at least one item with psionic powers.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> J&rsquo;ez usually live in rocky badlands and sandy wastes, terrain that exists throughout most of their nation in the North. J&rsquo;ez are often psionicists and philosophers, but tend to be aggressive. Their philosophy requires them to remain combat capable. J&rsquo;ez have mating habits and gestation periods similar to those of thri-kreen. J&rsquo;ez can live to be 80 years old.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Tohr-kreen are carnivores. They build towns and cities. They work with a similar species, the zik-chil, to produce zik-trin&rsquo;ta scouts.</p>

<p>J&rsquo;ez architecture and art are average, but their literature is superb. Treasure carried by a j&rsquo;ez is often books and gems (substitute psionic items for any indicated magical items).</p>
  <h2>J&rsquo;hol Tohr-kreen</h2>

<p class="f">The figures given are for mature adult j&rsquo;hol. Others have the following abilities, based on their age (they age one age category per year until they reach mature adult):</p>
  <table class="ip">
   <tr class="bk"><th></th><th>HD</th><th>THAC0</th><th>XP</th><th>Claw/bite Damage</th><th>Special Ability</th></tr>
   <tr><td>Larva</td><td>1+3</td><td>19</td><td>65</td><td>1/1</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Child</td><td>2+3</td><td>17</td><td>120</td><td>1/1</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Young</td><td>3+3</td><td>17</td><td>175</td><td>1d3/1d3</td><td>leap</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Young adult</td><td>4+3</td><td>15</td><td>270</td><td>1d3/1d3</td><td>chatkcha, kyorkcha, dodge missiles</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Adult</td><td>5+3</td><td>15</td><td>975</td><td>1d4/1d4+1</td><td>venom</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Mature adult</td><td>6+3</td><td>13</td><td>1,400</td><td>1d4/1d4+1</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr>
  </table>

<p>A j&rsquo;hol has red chitin, three claws per hand, and large antennae. A j&rsquo;hol&rsquo;s abdomen is small compared to other kreens, and the j&rsquo;hol is almost humanoid in appearance. A j&rsquo;hol is better built for stony barrens and rocky badlands, terrain that exists throughout most of its nation.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> J&rsquo;hol enjoy combat. Many have warrior character classes and some are psionicists. J&rsquo;hol prefer long-range combat with missiles and psionics, but also use then leaping ability to charge into combat (standard charging adjustments, -2 to initiative, +2 to attack rolls, and a +1 penalty to AC). J&rsquo;hol usually enter melee using a gythka, but also fight with claws and bite if necessary. J&rsquo;hol tohr-kreen have a natural AC 5 because of their exoskeletons and are immune to <i>hold person</i> and <i>charm person</i> spells. They also learn other special abilities as they grow older.</p>

<p><i>Leap:</i> This ability allows j.hol to leap 30 feet straight up or 60 feet forward. They can leap backward 10 feet.</p>

<p><i>Chatkcha:</i> J&rsquo;hol can throw two chatkcha or kyorkcha per round, as far as 270 feet. A chatkcha causes 3-8 (1d6+2) points of damage, the kyorkcha, 3-10 (1d8+2) points of damage. Both weapons return to the thrower if they miss.</p>

<p><i>Dodge missiles:</i> Mature j&rsquo;hol can dodge missiles fired at them on a roll of 8 or better on 1d20. They cannot dodge magical effects, only physical missiles. Magical physical missiles (arrows, thrown axes) modify this roll by their magical bonus.</p>

<p><i>Venom:</i> Though j&rsquo;hol produce venom like other kreen, most use it to produce the crystal needed to make chatkcha and kyorkcha. Only 5% of j&rsquo;hol actually have a venomous bite. Their venom paralyzes most creatures for 1-4 (1d4) rounds, huge and gargantuan creatures for only 1 round.</p>

<p><i>Psionics:</i> At least one j&rsquo;hol (and as many as 25%) in a group is a psionicist. About 50% of the rest have psionic wild talents, described in <i>The Complete Psionics Handbook</i>.</p>

<p><i>Magical and psionic items:</i> J&rsquo;hol rarely use magical items, but sometimes carry items with psionic powers.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> J&rsquo;hol are more inclined toward building and crafting the other tohr-kreen. Their cities are elaborately made, and usually quite large, with vast parks, ornate decorations, high walkways, and tall spires.</p>

<p>Popular professions among j&rsquo;hol include the psionicist and all warrior professions. Gladiators are rare among j&rsquo;hol, but j&rsquo;hol enjoy combat and like watching gladiatorial contests; their arenas are some of the most popular in the North.</p>

<p>J.hol have mating habits and gestation periods similar to those of thri-kreen and can live to be 50 years old.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> J&rsquo;hol are builders and make fine clothing and tools, and they are the only kreen who routinely work metal. J&rsquo;hol make beautiful crystalline weapons. For individuals, a finely made crystalline weapon (a chatkcha or kyorkcha, or a gythka with crystalline heads) should be substituted for indicated art objects, while a psionic item should be used if a magical item is indicated.</p>
