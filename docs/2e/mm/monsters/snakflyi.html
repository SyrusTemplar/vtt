<p class="f">Flying <a href="lizarman.html">lizard men</a> and <a href="yuanti.html">yuan-ti</a> who train flying snakes to hunt for them, or learn to work with the snakes as partners.</p>

<p>These reptiles have a pair of flaring, <a href="bat.html">bat</a>like, leathery wings behind their heads. They can fly with acrobatic agility, hovering, flying upside down, and using their tails and body coils to hamper victims in mid-air.</p>

<p>Flying snakes may be of any color or appearance. Most have flat, pointed, viper-like heads, red or yellow eyes, and emerald-green or bronze scales.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Flying snakes bite and slash with their needle-sharp fangs, or spit acid at opponents up to ten feet away. An acid spit does 1d4 damage to tissue, hide or cloth, but does not affect metal or stone.</p>

<p>Flying fangs always strike at the faces of their foes, seeking to blind beings so they can be slain and devoured at the fangs&rsquo; leisure. The snakes will attack any living creature they feel they can slay and eat.</p>

<p>Against S-sized or smaller creatures, a flying snake can grasp and encoil its victim. This does no damage, but lowers the victim&rsquo;s movement rate by 8 (to a minimum of 1) and penalizes the victim&rsquo;s armor class by 6 points (to a minimum of 10). To wrap its coils around an opponent, a flying snake must make a successful attack roll. Allow one attempt every 2 rounds of combat as an extra attack roll. If both snake and target creature are airborne, the attack roll is made at -1.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Although some flying snakes are solitary, most hunt in bands, attacking fearlessly in a swooping, darting cloud around victims.</p>

<p>These winged horrors are found in ruins, subterranean areas, and rocky crags throughout the Realms. They can tolerate a wide range of climates, but seem to be more numerous in Calimshan and the Shining South than elsewhere.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> A single flying snake eats five times its weight in a day, if it can get that much. Hunting flights often slay a dozen man-sized victims or more if they judge that other predators will leave the bodies undisturbed, for later meals.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Deathfang</b></p>
<p class="ni">Deathfangs are undead flying snakes. They are sometimes created when <a href="vampire.html">vampires</a> or other greater undead slay a flying snake (20% chance), and when certain evil priests or wizards with specialized knowledge use spells to convert a flying snake to undeath; in the Realms, such spells are used almost exclusively in Calimshan and lands to the south.</p>

<p>Deathfangs attack and function as living flying snakes do, except their bony wings cannot move as much air as intact, living membranes, thus slowing their rate of flight. Their acid-spit is lost upon joining the ranks of the undead. As undead, deathfangs gain a chilling bite power, usable once every six rounds. Upon successfully biting for 1-3 damage, a deathfang can elect to drain energy from a foe. It does this by retaining its fang-grip, allowing the foe an automatically successful attack on it the following round. Through its fangs, the deathfang drains 1d4+2 hit points per round from its victim (no saving throw).</p>

<p>In addition, deathfangs have magical immunities common to many undead. They are immune to cold-based attacks, <i>charm</i>, <i>sleep</i>, <i>hold</i>, and death spells, and can be mentally controlled or influenced only by their creator, if any.</p>
