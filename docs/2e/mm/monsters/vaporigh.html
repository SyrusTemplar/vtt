<p class="f"><img src="../images/spc/vaporig2.gif" width="300" height="360" border="0" alt="Vaporighu" title="Vaporighu" style="float:left;">Vaporighu are evil creatures of the underworld that lurk in the foul furnaces of Gehenna. They prey on unwary travelers, lesser fiends, and the occasional petitioner or <a href="larva0179.html?larva">larva</a>. Unlike many fiends of similar strength, vaporighu don&rsquo;t seem to have any causes or motives; they exist only to cause pain and suffering to any sod unfortunate enough to cross their path.</p>

<p>A vaporighu&rsquo;s a disgusting, horrifying thing to behold. Its body is vaguely humanoid, but bloated and grotesque. Their mottled skin varies from sickly pink to purple and glistens with a foul, corrosive slime. Pulsating arteries writhe just below the surface of the vaporighu&rsquo;s skin in a hideous dance of living gore. Dense, matted fur clings to their forearms, lower legs, and torso, stinking of death and decay. The creature wheezes loudly with a wet, bellowslike sound, and its stench&rsquo;ll linger for days in a place it&rsquo;s passed through.</p>

<p>Vaporighu like to lurk in spots where other creatures&rsquo;re bound to come by sooner or later, like commonly-used paths, Gehenna&rsquo;s few foul springs, or near places where portals appear. They savagely attack anything short of a greater <a href="yugolothe8f9.html?yugoloth">yugoloth</a>, and sometimes even those. Vaporighu don&rsquo;t speak any language known to humans or their kind, and probably wouldn&rsquo;t have much to say to a planar or prime traveler in any event.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Vaporighu radiate a powerful area of fear and horror that can overwhelm most bashers. The mere sight of a vaporighu forces creatures of 3 HD or less to survive a saving throw versus spell with or be paralyzed with terror for 1d6 rounds, unable to move, attack, or take any action except cower in fright. Creatures of 7 HD or less must successfully save versus spell with a -4 penalty or flee for 1d6 rounds in fear. Creatures of more than 7 HD save with no penalty and flee for only 1d4 rounds if they fail. The vaporighu&rsquo;ll rarely attempt to run down a fleeing character and prefers to concentrate its attacks on anything too frightened to move.</p>

<p>Should a cutter resist the urge to escape from the vaporighu&rsquo;s presence, he&rsquo;ll find that he probably should&rsquo;ve run when he had the chance. In melee, the creature strikes twice per round with its thick-fingered hands, inflicting 1d6+2 points of damage with each hit. Each time the vaporighu strikes an opponent, it leaves corrosive slime on its victim that slowly destroys clothing and armor.</p>

<p>If the slime isn&rsquo;t cleaned off within an hour, any clothing affected rots completely away, and armor begins to lose 1 AC value for every three hours it&rsquo;s allowed to continue disintegrating. For example, if the vaporighu&rsquo;s slime wasn&rsquo;t cleaned off of chainmail (base AC 5) in the first hour, the armor degrades to AC 6 three hours after that, AC 7 six hours later, and so on. If the armor&rsquo;s cleaned off after it loses an AC value, the corrosion stops but the armor remains at its reduced value. Magical clothing or armor gains a single item saving throw versus acid to resist the degradation.</p>

<p>The vaporighu&rsquo;s favorite and most dangerous attack is its foul breath. Once per turn, the creature bloats up to almost twice its normal size, and then expels a poisonous cloud of bright green gas 10 feet in diameter directly in front of it. Any creature in the area of effect must survive a saving throw versus poison or be slain. Creatures who survive the attack must leave the cloud immediately or suffer 1d10 points of damage each round they remain inside. The vaporighu&rsquo;s poisonous gas lingers for 2d4 rounds. It works equally well by inhalation or contact, so a basher shouldn&rsquo;t think that holding his breath&rsquo;ll help him any.</p>

<p>Like many creatures of the Lower Planes, vaporighu command several spell-like powers, usable at the 10th level of ability. These include <i>animate object</i>, <i>continual light</i>, <i>enlarge</i>, <i>fly</i>, <i>misdirection</i>, <i>produce flame</i>, <i>sleep</i>, and <i>trip</i>. Vaporighu can use these powers one at a time, once per round, at will. In addition, they can <i>gate</i> 1 to 4 <a href="_linkc204c204.html?nighthag">night hags</a> once per day with a 25% chance of success. Vaporighu hate to do this since they&rsquo;ll have to reward the hags somehow for their service.</p>

<p>One last thing a cutter ought to know before he thinks about starting a scrap with a vaporighu: Only weapons forged of cold-wrought iron can harm them. Enchanted weapons can&rsquo;t injure the creatures no matter how powerful the weapon is, unless it&rsquo;s made of cold-wrought iron (and then, only the base damage applies; the additional enchanted damage is negated). More than a few bloods&rsquo;ve tumbled to this fact the hard way.</p>

<p>Vaporighu can&rsquo;t be surprised in Gehenna, but on the other hand they&rsquo;re incapable of surprising anything with ears or a sense of smell.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Vaporighu are loners that have little nr no contact with others of their kind. In fact, there&rsquo;s no way to say whether they just dislike each other, respect each other&rsquo;s territory, or can&rsquo;t stand to see another of their kind &mdash; no one&rsquo;s ever seen two vaporighu together, so there&rsquo;s no basis for a hypothesis.</p>

<p>Very few creatures&rsquo;ve got the means or temperament to communicate with vaporighu. By all accounts, they&rsquo;re petty and cruel creatures who delight in causing injury to anything they meet. Their appetites&rsquo;re said to be insatiable, a gnawing pain that tortures vaporighu throughout eternity: this might explain the creature&rsquo;s violence and savagery.</p>

<p>Vaporighu like to find a good hunting ground and stay there, marking several ambush sites and lairs in a fairly localized area. They&rsquo;re not particularly fond of treasure, but tend to accumulate the remains of countless victims in their main lair.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Vaporighu are creatures of supernatural vileness and evil, and have no place in any kind of sane ecology. On the other hand, the burning mountains of Gehenna don&rsquo;t have a sane ecology by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

<p>Vaporighu feed on anything weaker than themselves without regard for the consequences. Some sages&rsquo;ve speculated that vaporighu are materializations or embodiments of the foulness of Gehenna, while others say that the creatures were once a variety of yugoloth that forgot how to leave the plane.</p>
