<p class="f">The cabhaigh (ca-VAY) looks like a cross between a huge <a href="_link938c938c.html?frog">frog</a> and a <a href="drgnfly0584.html?drgnfly">dragonfly</a>. Its body is bulbous and its stick-like legs end in claws. Protruding from its back are two sets of gossamer wings. The creature can change its vivid colors, though none of these hues seems quite natural.</p>

<p>The creature prefers to fly and is capable of carrying up to 300 pounds. Walking is a slow and awkward process on its stick-thin legs.Usually it flies from place to place, perching like a <a href="birdabae.html?bird">bird</a> on branches and rooftops, where it csn get a good view of what is below. The creature is reported to speak human tongues, <a href="elfaab4.html?elf">elvish</a>, and elvish dialects. A wizard in the company of the cabhaigh can communicate telepathically with it.</p>

<p>Twice a day the cabhaigh can call upon a special <i>polymorph</i> ability that lets it turn into a dragonfly 3-4 inches long for 8 hours. In this form, it retains all of its abilities and hit points. Once a day it can <i>polymorph another</i> individual or creature into a dragonfly, a form lasting 1d4 turns. A saving throw vs. spell negates the effect. In addition, it can cast two 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-level spells per day, at the 8th level of ability.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> The cabhaigh is a fierce fighter. Its keening weapon fires a harsh, high-pitched sound, radiating outward in a cine 2 feet across at the creature&rsquo;s mouth, 15 feet long, and 15 feet wide at the end. All those caught in the cone suffer 1d8 points of damage. Furtherm they must make a saving throw vs. paralysis or be rooted to the spot for 1d6 rounds. The cabhaigh can use its keening weapon three times a day. The cabhaigh&rsquo;s bite inflicts only 1d4 points of damage; it prefers to use ths as a last resort, staying out of close combat.</p>

<p>It is impossible to strike the cabhaigh withour at least a +3 weapon</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> This <a href="_linkdbf0dbf0.html?garradal">garradalaigh</a> is said to dwell on temperate mountains apart form civilization and most other forms of life. When it does seek the companionship of a wizard, it does so rarely and briefly &mdash; usually only when an odd loneliness overcomes it. It has also been known to seek the company of other garradalaighs. Tales most often place this creature in eastern Khinasi.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> The cabhaigh has few predators; most of these are evil humans, <a href="goblin62b3.html?goblin">goblins</a>, and <a href="ogre77fe.html?ogre">ogres</a>.</p>

<p>It subsists on very little &mdash; potions when it can find them, spell components, and blades of grass that have been washed by recent rains. It is said never to kill for food.</p>
