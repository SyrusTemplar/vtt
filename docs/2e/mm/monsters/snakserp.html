<p class="f">Two rare varieties of serpents, the herald serpent and the teak serpent, can be found in teeming tropical jungles, often in the company of other intelligent reptilian creatures.</p>
  <h2>Herald Serpent</h2>

<p class="f">The heraid is a lightning-swift reptile wth sapphire or emerald colored eyes, and a body marked wirh black and gold bands. Hcralds are the enchanted messengers of <a href="serplord19ba.html?serplord">serpent lords</a>. Like their masters, heralds are adept linguists and conversationalists, able to speak at least six languages fluently, including common.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Herald serpents are more likely to talk their way out of a confrontation than attack, using their silver tongues to flatter an opponent while planning an escape route. A herald serpent can cast the following spells, once/day, at the 4th level of ability: <i>friends</i>, <i>hypnotism</i>, <i>comprehend languages</i>, <i>hypnotic pattern</i>, and <i>invisibility</i>.</p>

<p>If negotiation fails and escape is impossible, the herald can physically attack with its lightning-swift bite, striking twice per round for 1d4 points of damage. The bite automitically delivers a potent toxin, with an onset time of only 1-3 rounds (saving throw vs. poison negates). Victims of the poison suffer complete amnesia, forgetting their own identities, abilities, even memorized spells for 2-8 hours.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Herald serpents are the enchanted messengers of serpent lords, who imbue their servants with magical gifts so they can deliver important notices or act as envoys on their lord&rsquo;s behalf. Before their enchantment, heralds are a colorful variety of poisonous jungle <a href="snakede1b.html?snake">snake</a>. Heralds serve their lord willingly and are usually returned to their normal state after completing the mission for which they were enchanted. A <i>dispel magic</i>, successful against 16th-level magic, will transform a herald back into a giant poisonous snake with lethal poison.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> As an enchanted creature, herald serpents have no niche in the ecology of the world, though like any snake, they must eat live prey (birds and small animals, mostly) to survive.</p>
  <h2>Teak Serpent</h2>

<p class="f">Teak serpents are a variety of huge constrictor snakes inhabiting teak and ironwood forests. Adults often reach lengths exceeding 30 feet.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> These reptiles resemble branches of the hardwood trees they inhabit, giving opponents a -2 penalty on surprise and the serpent a superior Armor Class (AC 3).</p>

<p>Teak serpents wait patiently in the upper canopy of trees for an unsuspecting victim to pass underneath, attacking from above with a combination bite and constriction attack. The bite inflicts 1d6 points of damage; if a constriction attack is successful, the serpent squeezes each round thereafter for 2d6 points of damage. The coils of a teak serpent are stronger than ironwood, requiring the combined efforts of 80 points of Strength to release a trapped victim. With their prodigious length, one of these serpents can constrict up to three man-sized creatures simultaneously.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Because of their ferocity and immense size, teak serpents are feared in the jungles they inhabit. Teak serpents usually subsist on a diet of large animals (preferring baby <a href="elephante4b4.html?elephant">elephants</a>, when they are available), but they will attack a small group of man-sized creatures without hesitation. They often sleep for up to a week after feeding.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> The scales of a teak serpent, if used while casting <i>barkskin</i>, provide a +2 bonus to Armor Class for the duration of the spell. Teak serpents are sometimes captured by powerful spellcasters and bound into magical staves.</p>
