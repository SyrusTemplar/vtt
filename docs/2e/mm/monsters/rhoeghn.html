<p class="f">The rhoeghn (ROON) resembles a human child, though its skin is the color of rich, brown earth. Its long, flowing locks are green and leafy. Wings at its elbows, knees, and ankles look like large fern leaves, constantly in motion. The eyes of the rhoegn are its most striking feature: large, saucerlikem and lidless. Black as midnight, the eyes reflect everything the rhoeghn sees.</p>

<p>Surprisingly strong, the rhoeghn can carry up to 400 lbs. in flight. The rhoegn can alter its appearance at will, taking on the shape of a deer or a clump of waist-high ferns. It speaks most human and elf dialects, but cannot speak to animals. Though able to read scrolls like a mage, the rhoeghn has little interest in scrolls that are not nature-based. Twice a day it can use an innate <i>speak with plants</i> ability.</p>

<p>The rhoeghn&rsquo;s senses are acute, picking up the slightest whisper or spotting the smallest detail. It can count grains of sand by touch. Its sense of smell allows it to detect poisons and other toxins with just a whiff.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> The rhoeghn&rsquo;s dexterity grants it a +3 reaction adjustment to its surprise rolls. It prefers to avoid fighting. When necessary, howeer, it strikes with the razor-sharp claws on its hands and feet. The creature uses its wings to keep in the air sa as to attack with all of its limbs each round.</p>

<p>In addition, every three combat rounds the rhoeghn can employ a wing buffet attack. This is a cone-shaped effect 5 feet wide in front of the creature, 15 feet wide at the end, amd 25 feet long. Everyone and everything weighing less than 300 lbs. within the cone must make a saving throw vs. paralysis with a -3 penalty or be blown backward by the wind. Those who succeed in their saving throws suffer 1d4 points of damage from pelting by small object kicked up by the wind. Those who fail their saving throws suffer 2d4 points of damage from flying objects and are blown back 3d6 feet &mdash; unless walls, trees, or other obstacles (that might inflict even more damage) block their way.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Ancient texts say that the rhoeghn rarely enjoys the company of any wizards, but is most likely to seek out those of elf descent. The texts identify elven forests, particularly the Coulladaraight in northern Khinasi, as the rhoeghn&rsquo;s home.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> The rhoeghn has few predators, as it is difficult to catch and does little to offend other creatures. It hunts only wildflowers, dining on the dainty blossoms and rainsoaked petals. It is especially fond of eating honeysuckle and violets.</p>
