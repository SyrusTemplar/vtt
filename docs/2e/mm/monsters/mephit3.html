  <h2>Fire Mephit</h2>

<p class="f">The most mischievous of all <a href="mephitb2b8.html?mephit">mephits</a>, these fiends play terrible pranks on other mephits, such as pushing <a href="_link79af79af.html?mephit7">magma mephits</a> into water and watching them harden.</p>

<p>Fire mephits are small, wiry humanoids with bright red skin and bat-wings. Some fire mephits affect a mustache, goatee, and tiny horns on their forehead, but these are always faked.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Touching a fire mephit causes 1 hp heat damage. Its two clawed hands rake for 1d3 damage each plus 1 hp heat damage per hit.</p>

<p>Fire mephits can use their breath weapon three times a day. In one form it is a flame jet 15&rsquo; long and 1&rsquo; wide that automatically hits one chosen target (1d8+1 damage; save vs. breath weapon for half damage). The second form, a fan of flame, covers a 120 arc in front of the mephit to a distance of five feet. Any creature in the arc suffers 4 hp damage (no save).</p>

<p>Fire mephits can also cast <i>magic missile</i> (two missiles) and <i>heat metal</i> spells once each per day. Once per hour a fire mephit can attempt to <i>gate</i> in another mephit, either fire, magma, <a href="mephit14e1c.html?mephit1">smoke</a> or <a href="mephit8ffda.html?mephit8">steam</a>.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Fire mephits sometimes prove useful heating forges, warming bedclothes, or lighting cigars.</p>
  <h2>Radiant Mephit</h2>

<p class="f">Prone to non sequiturs and glazed looks, radiant mephits appear permanently, blissfully dazed by the glories of the quasi-plane of Radiance. They peer fixedly at people and say things like, &ldquo;Have you too seen the majesty of the Ultimate Light? Oh, look at that amazing reflection on your armor there! Nice&hellip; Sorry, was I talking?&rdquo; They take overblown names as do other mephits, hut never remember them.</p>

<p>Radiant mephits have silvery bodies that perfectly reflect their surroundings like a mirror, large black eyes, and thin prismatic wings. They have wide mouths, but their faces are usually expressionless, except during their sudden fits of crazed giggling.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Radiant mephits can attack with two claws (1d3 damage each). They can cast <i>color spray</i> once per turn at 6th level of magic use. However, unless directly attacked, they usually become distracted and forget their opponents.</p>

<p>Once per hour a radiant mephit can attempt to <i>gate</i> in another radiant mephit.</p>

<p>Radiant mephits are immune to all spells that affect or work through vision, including <i>color spray</i> and visual illusions, but they receive no saving throws against mind-affecting magic. They have infravision to 120&rsquo;. In strong light they regenerate 1 hp per turn.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Radiant mephits lack the attention span to carry out missions. They are created primarily because some powerful beings of lawful alignment find their <i>color sprays</i> (dim recreations of the plane of Radiance) soothing or mesmerizing.</p>
