<p class="f">The <a href="elementa69e1.html?elementa">elementals</a> of chaos are intelligent creatures native to one of the four elemental planes. Each of these elementals pursues its own interests vigorously with little, if any, care for order on either its home plane or the Prime Material Plane.</p>

<p>All elementals of chaos are immune to poison, normal weapons, and 1st- and 2nd-level spells. They also can cast <i>detect invisibility</i> at will. Elementals of chaos cast spells at the 9th level of ability.</p>
  <h2>Pyrophor</h2>

<p class="f">Their eerily shifting features make pyrophors appear as flickering coals 5 feet in diameter, with fingers of flame that periodically flare out. These natives of the Elemental Plane of Fire move very quickly and, in the air, resemble small meteors.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Every pyrophor loves to cause fires on the Prime Material Plane. In battle, they always attempt to set their opponents on fire by lashing out with spiky finger-flames. A pyrophor can attack twice per round, causing 2d6 points of damage with each hit. In addition, a target a fiery appendage has hit must make a successful saving throw vs. wands or burst into flames; objects that normally don&rsquo;t burn, like metal and stone, receive a +4 bonus to this saving throw. The fire causes 1d6 points of damage each round until put out. Victims must spend ld4 rounds rolling on the ground or one round immersed in water to douse the flames.</p>

<p>Pyrophors are immune to all fire-based attacks, and can use the following spells three times per day: <i>detect magic</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>Melf&rsquo;s minute meteors</i>, and <i>fire storm</i>. They also can cast <i>affect normal fires</i> at will. These elementals always suffer maximum damage from water-based attacks.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Pyrophors, perhaps the most cavalierly violent of the elementals, revel in the destructive powers of fire. They often use their abilities in malicious play, bathing parts of the Prime Material Plane in &ldquo;purifying&rdquo; flame.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Bothering the lawful <a href="elemlafw0260.html?elemlafw">helions</a> always sounds like a lot of fun to a pyrophor. They fear water-type creatures and water attacks, and particularly hate the <a href="elemlafw0260.html?elemlafw">hydrax</a> and undines.</p>
  <h2>Undine</h2>

<p class="f">Undines reside on the Elemental Plane of Water and rarely visit the Prime Material Plane.</p>

<p>On its home plane, an undine normally looks like a featureless, transparent snake. It can change shape easily, sometimes adopting a form with many tentacles to handle objects. Once per turn, an undine can spend up to five rounds swimming quickly (movement rate of 48) in the form of a spinning coil. These elementals remain invisible while immersed in water.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> An undine can attack using a fistlike pod, by constricting, or with spells. Using its &ldquo;fist&rdquo;, the creature can attack once per round. If the blow hits, it causes 2d8 points of damage. The undine then can coil around its opponent, squeezing for 1d10 points of automatic constriction damage per round. The elemental can coil around any creature of giant size or less, rendering its foe unable to move, attack, or concentrate.</p>

<p>An undine also can cast the following spells up to three times per day: <i>detect magic</i>, <i>web</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>ice storm</i>, and <i>transmute dust to water</i>. An undine&rsquo;s <i>web</i>, made of ice strands, functions in the same way as one from a normal <i>web</i> spell. However, flame melts the strands rather than burning them, and trapped victims suffer no damage. The undine itself is immune to all waterbased attacks, but fire-based attacks cause the creature double the normal amount of damage.</p>

<p>While on the Prime Material Plane, an undine regenerates 3 hit points per round while in water. When out of water, however, the creature loses 1 point per round from drying.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The solitary undines possess a philosophy similar to that of <a href="_link95109510.html?genie">djinn</a>: to aid those whom they consider worthy. Little is known of the undines&rsquo; social structure or ultimate goals, if they have any at all.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Undines count helions and <a href="horde29dc.html?horde">hordes</a> as enemies and fear all fire-based beings and flame attacks.</p>
