<p class="f">Half-elves are the offspring of human and elven parents.</p>

<p>Half-elves strongly resemble their elven parent, but unlike the elven races, males have facial hair. They are slightly taller and somewhat stockier than most elves.</p>

<p>Since most are raised in an atmosphere of shame, half-elves are insecure and unsure of themselves. In extreme instances, this insecurity manifests itself in rebellious or anti-social behavior. Others are trusting of strangers, yet lack the openness necessary to establish true and lasting friendship. Many are natural leaders, but few feel worthy of a leader&rsquo;s responsibility Regardless of their disposition, all half-elves are loners &mdash; brooding, quiet, and struggling with self-doubt.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Half.elves are excellent fighters with no obvious tears. If there is a flaw in their fighting style, it iS their tendency to perform life-threatening acts of bravado. A half-elf often challenges the most formidable opponent in a group of attackers or volunteers for the most dangerous missions.</p>

<p>Half-elves particularly excel at melee attacks; magic-using half-elves usually reserve their spells for emergencies or to assist their companions. Long swords are their favorite weapons, but they also frequently use daggers and long bows. They wear a variety of armor, preferring chain mail when it is avariable. Unlike other elven races, half-elves can be skilled horsemen.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Because elves and humans are often attracted to each other, intermarriage is all but inevitable. No elven race, however, sanctions such marriages, forcing elven and human lovers into discreet relationships.</p>

<p>Reaction to half-elves from other races varies. The race-conscious <a href="elfhsilv.html">Silvanesti</a>, for instance, are particularly revolted by interracial marriages. <a href="elfhqual.html">Qualinesti</a> are more compassionate toward half-elves, treating them coldly but allowing them a place in their societies. However, half-elves seldom rise to positions of trust or responsibility in a Qualinesti community. <a href="elfwkago.html">Kagonesti</a> respect half-elves as they would any creature of nature, but they are never accepted as full members of a tribe.</p>

<p>Humans have a mixed reaction to half-elves. Years ago, half-elves in human society were considered a great blessing and brought honor to a human household, but this attitude has diminished considerably with the passage of time. Humans now view half-elves as a strange and vaguely inferior race.</p>

<p>There is no society or community that consists solely of half-elves. Though some halt-elves learn trades or crafts most drift from place to place</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Half-elves feel kinship with no race, although they occasionally find lasting friendship with humans and <a href="dwarhill.html">Neidar</a>. They prefer simple foods, but have no particular preferences.</p>
