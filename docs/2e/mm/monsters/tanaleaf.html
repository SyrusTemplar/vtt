<p class="f"><img src="../images/spc/alufiend.gif" width="300" height="360" border="0" alt="Alu-Fiend" title="Alu-Fiend" style="float:left; margin-right:.5em;">Alu-fiends, the horrid female offspring of <a href="tanalesu631f.html?tanalesu">succubus</a> and human, look like comely human females with attractive, powerful features. Only their sharp, upsloping eyebrows and wings indicate the truth.</p>

<p>Alu-fiends usually communicate using telepathy, but can sometimes speak additional languages.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Alu-fiends have an innate intuition that warns them of impending danger 75% of the time. They have no natural attack forms save fists and teeth (normal human damage). About 75% of them carry enchanted weapons, often gifts from their evil mothers. These weapons are most likely of common make (i.e. +1, +2, etc.), but there is a 15% chance for a special weapon. The fiend relies heavily on a special weapon and never willingly parts with it.</p>

<p>Alu-fiends can restore their own bit points at the expense of their opponents. This requires a normal melee hit (1d8 damage, of which the alu-fiend gets half, rounded up).</p>

<p>These creatures have base Armor Class 5, the heritage of their unnatural mother. Enchanted armor or protective items can improve the base AC. As with weapons, 75% of ah-fiends wear enchanted armor of common make (+1, +2, etc.). There is a 5% chance such armor is special (e.g. <i>plate mail of etherealness</i>, etc.).</p>

<p>For both magical armor and weapons, choose appropriate items from the tables on pages 139-140 of the <i>DMG</i>.</p>

<p>In addition to those available to all <a href="tanarri706b.html?tanarri">tanar&rsquo;ri</a>, all alu-fiends, regardless of intelligence, have the following spell-like powers: <i>charm person</i>, <i>dimension door</i> (once per day), <i>ESP</i>, <i>shape change</i> (to a humanoid form of approximately their own height and weight only), and <i>suggestion</i>.</p>

<p>All alu-fiends have infravision to 240&rsquo;. Alu-fiends are affected only by cold-wrought iron or magical weapons.</p>

<p>Fully 10% of alu-fiends have Genius intelligence; they have all the spell-like powers of their sisters and are also actual mages. Genius alu-fiends are 1st- to 12th-level mages with full spell ability and can choose spells from any school. Genius alu-fiends are never specialist wizards.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Alu-fiends tend to be hateful, even by tanar&rsquo;ri standards, because of their dual nature. They view themselves as outcasts, neither human or tanar&rsquo;ri. Other tanar&rsquo;ri view them the same way, as lowly and without purpose. Only the alu-fiends&rsquo; power keeps them in contention as a lesser tanar&rsquo;ri race.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> If an alu-fiend can somehow hide her wings, she is mistaken for a human 70% of the time.</p>

<p>Interestingly, about 20% of alu-fiends are chaotic neutral or true neutral in alignment. This usually occurs when a succubus mates with a non-evil human and the offspring retains a hint of her father&rsquo;s morality.</p>
