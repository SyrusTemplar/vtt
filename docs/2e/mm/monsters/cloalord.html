<p class="f">Cloaker lords are a superior sub-race of the feared subterranean race of <a href="cloaker8bde.html?cloaker">cloakers</a>. They look just like large cloakers, appearing either as a black cloak, such as an <a href="ogre77fe.html?ogre">ogre</a> or small giant might wear &mdash; or unfurling to reveal their <a href="bat5f3f.html?bat">bat</a>like true form, with ivory-clawed black wings, a flattish body whose white underside is inset with a red-eyed, needle-fanged, horned face, and a lashing, whiplike tail.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Cloaker lords fly at targets and try to engulf them. A successful attack roll means a cloaker lord has wrapped itself around a target&rsquo;s body. An engulfed victim cannot use any weapon longer than the arm wielding it, but automatically hits the cloaker with smaller weapons, at a -3 damage penalty. The cloaker lord also automatically bites the engulfed victim, doing 2d4 (plus the victim&rsquo;s unadjusted Armor Class, ignoring shields) points of damage per round. Cloaker lords absorb blood through their skins, devouring victims until only cleaned bones remain, to spill out of the unfurling &ldquo;cloak&rdquo;. Attacks against an engulfing cloaker lord inflict half their damage on the monster, and half on the trapped victim. Area effect spells such as <i>fireball</i> inflict full damage on both cloaker lord and victim.</p>

<p>While engulfing a victim, a cloaker lord can use its thick-muscled, bone-barbed tail to lash any nearby creature for 2d6 damage. The tail is AC1, and is severed if dealt more than 24 points of damage.</p>

<p>The cloaker lord&rsquo;s moan attack can cause an 90-foot-range unease and numbing, forcing all creatures in range to attack at -2, and suffer a -2 penalty on all damage rolls. Any creature who remains in range, and hears the moaning for six consecutive rounds is forced into a trance that lasts as long as the moaning continues. Entranced victims cannot make attacks or cast spells, and cannot defend themselves (anything attacking them does so at +6 on all attack rolls).</p>

<p>Alternatively, a cloaker&rsquo;s moan can act as a <i>fear</i> spell, affecting all beings within 40 feet of the cloaker lord. They must save vs. spell, or flee at full movement rate for 2 rounds.</p>

<p>The third intensity of moaning affects creatures in a conical area, extending 40 feet from the monster, and widening to 30 feet across at its open end. All beings in the area must save vs. poison at -1, or be overcome by nausea and weakness for 1d4 + 1 rounds (during this time, they are unable to take any deliberate action).</p>

<p>The fourth moan strength acts as a <i>hold monster</i> spell, affecting only one being, who must be within 50 feet. Its effects last 6 rounds &mdash; unless the monster attacks another target with this moan, which instantly frees a previously-<i>held</i> victim.</p>

<p>By means of <i>shadow shifting</i>, a cloaker lord can obscure the vision of opponents, raising its own effective Armor Class to 1 by cloaking itself in swirls of darkness. Most often, the cloaker creates duplicates of itself, to draw away enemy attacks; treat this effect as a <i>mirror image</i> spell that creates 1d4+2 images. A cloaker lord can use only one <i>shadow shifting</i> effect per round, but it can moan, attack physically (except biting, which makes moaning impossible), and employ <i>shadow shifting</i>, all in the same round.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Cloaker lords can elude most mind-communication and -influencing psionics and spells because of their strange thought processes (determine what occurs on a case-by-case basis; attackers will have more success, the more practice they have in using such powers against cloaker lords). Cloaker lords hold a natural domination over cloakers, and have recently come to rule their lesser brethren, drawing normally-solitary cloakers together into loose raiding bands, and forcing other monsters (such as deepspawn, subdued by moans) into servitude.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> A cloaker lord that reaches a certain age or is near death will find a cloaker and devour it. If the cloaker lord survives 2d4 days longer, it splits apart, giving birth to a cloaker lord and 1d6 cloakers, all &ldquo;babies&rdquo; of miniature size. All can moan at birth, but their attacks do only half damage, and they can&rsquo;t yet control their <i>shadow shifting</i>. Instinct drives them to fly in different directions, to seek prey and master their powers.</p>
