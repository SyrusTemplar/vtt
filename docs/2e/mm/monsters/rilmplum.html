<p class="f">The least powerful <a href="rilmaniec97.html?rilmani">rilmani</a> are the plumachs, the common citizens of the Spire. Their brand of neutrality is the simplest and most apathetic view held hy the rilmani: Don&rsquo;t get involved. The plumachs&rsquo;re staunch isolationists who stay out of other peoples&rsquo; troubles, and they&rsquo;ll tell any berk who asks that they&rsquo;d appreciate it if other people&rsquo;d keep their troubles well clear of the Spire. &ldquo;Who cares what those leatherheads think?&rdquo; is a plumach proverb.</p>

<p>Although plumachs go to great lengths to mind their own business, they&rsquo;re involved in keeping an eye on things in the Outlands themselves. The other rilmani pay attention to the Balance in the realms of the Great Wheel, or out in the Prime or Elemental Planes, hut the plumachs make sure things don&rsquo;t go awry at home. Plumach traders and emissaries are common throughout the Land, but the farther they are from the Spire, the less likely they are to take action.</p>

<p>Plumachs&rsquo;re short, stocky humanoids with dull, gray metallic skins. They&rsquo;re broad-shouldered and thick-waisted, with wide, stubby hands and heavy legs. Plumachs lack the grace or strength of their more powerful kin, but they&rsquo;re stubborn and tenacious opponents. Some cutters take plumachs for stupid, but that&rsquo;s a risky assumption: Plumachs&rsquo;ve got a great store of practical wisdom and common sense. They believe in hard work, respect where respect&rsquo;s due, and the common courtesy of staying out of other people&rsquo;s business.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Plumachs resort to combat only when it&rsquo;s clear that their lives or interests&rsquo;re threatened. Otherwise, they don&rsquo;t want to get involved. Some cutters take the plumachs&rsquo; apathy for incompetence, and‘re rudely surprised when the plumachs decide to stand and fight. Plumachs fight with heavy maces, clubs, and mauls of lead, and their heavy build gives them an effective Strength of 17. Unarmed, a plumach can strike with his fists for 1d4 points of damage. Plumachs are dangerous in numbers, since they cooperate well in a fight and don&rsquo;t give up until they get the job done.</p>

<p>Plumachs possess a few spell-like ahilities, which they can use one at a time, once per round. These are <i>chill touch</i>, <i>detect alignment</i>, <i>heat metal</i>, and <i>hold person</i>. Once per day a plumach may create <i>solid fog</i>. They use these abilities as 4th-level spellcasters. Plumachs can be struck only by weapons enchanted to a value of +1 or better, and they cannot gate in any more of their kind.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> As the commoners of the Spire, plumachs are craftsmen, teamsters, and merchants. They carry out the day-to-day business of rilmani society. A plumach is the equal of the finest human craftsmen at his chosen trade. Since the rilmani as a race require no food, shelter, or clothing, the plumachs devote their time to creating devices of comfort and convenience or works of art.</p>

<p>In times of great need, plumach legions are mustered to defend the Balance. Plumachs aren&rsquo;t afraid of a scrap, and their natural strength and dense hides stand them in good stead against most low-level opponents. However, it takes the authority of an <a href="rilmauru01f2.html?rilmauru">aurumach</a> to convince the plumachs that a cause is worth fighting for.</p>
