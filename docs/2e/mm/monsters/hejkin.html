<p class="f">Hej-kin are a race of vile-looking humanoids who inhabit the natural subterranean caverns and tunnels of Athas.</p>

<p>Hej-kin have round chubby faces which are accented by large noses and small, slanted eyes. The ears of hej-kin are pointed, short, and covered with a thick fur. The skin color of hej-kin varies greatly, from deep red to a dark mossy green. Most hejkin clans will usually be all of the same color skin, and most tend to be reddish and orange colored. The skin of a hej-kin is thick and very tough, similar in texture to softened leather hide.</p>

<p>The language of the hej-kin is a combination of sign and verbal communication. Hej-kin speak in a low-pitched voice that resembles human mumbling in sound. Very few above-ground dwellers are familiar with the language of the hej-kin, for it is extremely difficult to learn. Characters attempting to interpret or speak hej-kin suffer a -3 penalty to their language proficiency, due to the unique and difficult nature of the language.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Hej-kin travel underground by means of a unique psionic ability which allows them to phase through rock. Use of this ability slows their movement to only 3 while phasing.</p>

<p>Hej-kin are able to use this ability to surprise any opponents or travellers who threaten their homes. When hej-kin attempt to surprise their enemies, apply a -2 penalty to all surprise rolls.</p>

<p>When they engage in combat, hej-kin attack with both their hands, raking their opponent with their sharp claws. A successful attack does 1-4 points of damage to their victim. Being competent psionicists, hej-kin are also able to attack with psionic powers. Like many of the creatures of Athas, hej-kin have naturally developed psionic defense modes, making them more resistant to psionic attacks. These defense modes are considered always &ldquo;on&rdquo;, meaning that even when making physical attacks, hej-kin are able to use their defense modes (providing they have enough PSPs to power the mode being used).</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Most clans make their homes in caverns adjacent to underground streams providing the clan with an adequate supply of water. Unlike many other types of subterranean dwellers, hej-kin do not dig tunnels or caves, for doing so would disturb the earth, which they consider to be sacred.</p>

<p>The average hej-kin clan contains four to five families, each consisting of three to six members. A family&rsquo;s living area is usually a smaller cave connected by tunnel to the cavern occupied by the rest of the clan. Hej-kin mark their dwellings by runes on the outer cave walls.</p>

<p>Hej-kin are omnivores, relying on both meat and vegetables as sources of food. Most of their food comes from subterranean plants and small underground creatures.</p>

<p>Within a clan of hej-kin, there exist examples of the warrior, priest, and mage classes. Warriors and mages rarely advance to high levels (7th or higher) due to the race&rsquo;s limited contact with other creatures. All hej-kin mages are preservers, due to their race&rsquo;s worship of the earth (see below). Priests, however, often reach very high levels of experience. All hej-kin priests worship the earth, as do all hej-kin. Hej-kin priests are the only members of their society who ever travel to the surface, usually to investigate some disturbance that threatens their home or the earth. Hej-kin are natural enemies to most other races, both surface dwellers and other subterranean races. This is due to the abuse and destruction of the earth perpetrated by other races.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Hej-kin live an average of 40 to 45 years. Most clans stay in the same place for periods of up to ten years, at which time they migrate to a new area.</p>

<p>Dust from the withered eyeballs of dead hej-kin is usable by earth-worshipping priests as material components for many earthen spells.</p>
