<p class="f">First discovered on the arctic island of Todstein (as described in the adventure <i>Ship of Horror</i>), snow <a href="golem1.html">greater golems</a>. Like others of their ilk, they are usually employed to guard an important item or entryway.</p>

<p>A snow golem can be sculpted in any appearance, but is usually portrayed as a humanoid figure wearing armor and a helmet. It usually carries no weapons and does not use a shield. Their helmets are usually sculpted into bizarre, frightening shapes such as snarling animals or horrid, leering faces. Because they have been hardened beyond the consistency of snow, they resemble white marble statues. Indeed, they are often mistaken for such things or for snow-covered topiary figures.</p>

<p>Snow golems cannot speak, although the wind seems always to blow mournfully when they move, creating a haunting sound that can chill the heart as surely as the cold climate does the flesh.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Snow golems share the characteristics common to all <a href="golerv.html">Ravenloft golems</a>, being damaged only by +2 or better weapons, immune to all manner of mind- or life-affecting spells (such as <i>charm</i>, <i>sleep</i>, <i>hold</i>, or <i>finger of death</i>), and taking no damage from poison or similar substances. They are likewise immune to all water- or cold-based attacks. and regain 1 hit point for every die of damage that such attacks would have caused.</p>

<p>If hit with an electrical attack while touching another creature, the attack is conducted through the body of the snow golem and does full damage to this being. If attacked in this way when not in contact with someone else, the golem seems unaffected. In actuality, it stores the charge, doing as much damage as it would have sustained to whomever it next comes into contact with.</p>

<p>Snow golems are able to breathe a cone of cold once every five rounds. This functions as if the spell of that name were being cast by a 10th level wizard.</p>

<p>In melee. they have two main modes of attack. The first (and favored) is to strike with their two massive fists for 2d12 points of damage each. In some instances. however, they will forego such attacks and attempt to grapple with their enemies. Such attacks are resolved using the normal rules for wrestling in the <i>Dungeon Master Guide</i>. Snow golems have a Strength score of 19 for the purposes of unarmed combat</p>

<p>Due to the extreme cold of their bodies, nonmagical weapons made of metal shatter when used against a snow golem. Even magical arms are not immune to this effect, having a 35% chance of being destroyed with each successful blow. This chance is reduced by 5% for every plus of the weapon above +2 (i.e. a +3 weapon has only a 30% chance of shattering).</p>

<p>Attacks employing magical fire harms them, but also release a cloud of scalding steam in a 20&rsquo; radius. Anyone caught in this vapor must make a saving throw vs. breath weapon or be burned for half the damage sustained by the creature. A successful saving throw negates all damage.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Snow golems are automatons capable of following a few simple commands. They are under the complete control of their master unless they manage to break his domination. Normally, they have no society, although there are rumors that free willed snow golems are sometimes found in one another&rsquo;s company.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> A wizard of 15th or greater level can create a snow golem. The body is sculpted of snow, taking four weeds and costing 45.000 gold pieces for materials and components. Obviously, this lengthy process must be undertaken in a naturally cold or refrigerated area. Once the body is completed, it is animated with the casting of <i>wish</i>, <i>polymorph any object</i>, <i>cone of cold</i>, and <i>permanency</i> spells.</p>
