<p class="f">Of all the creatures that have ever walked on Krynn, one of the wisest was Igrane, father of the Irda, the <a href="ogrehigh1408.html?ogrehigh">High Ogres</a>. Igrane was also a man of extraordinary foresight and prophetic ability; he foresaw that the race of ogres would become debased unless they turned away from evil, and he foresaw that the Irda would be tested.</p>

<p>To help his people survive in a world of physical and spiritual uncertainty, he gave the Irda two gifts. One was the Irdanaiath, a text that became sacred to the Irda. Sensing that this would not be enough, Igrane forsook death and the great honors he had earned in the afterlife, and divided his soul into eight parts. These pieces would wander the world wherever his children, the Irda and the <a href="ogremisc0fae.html?ogremisc">Mischta</a>, lived, advising them in moments of great crisis and protecting them in their hour of darkest need. These pieces of Igrane&rsquo;s spirit are known as wisdom spirits.</p>

<p>Wisdom spirits appear mainly at night, when all seems bleakest. In times of extreme need (for guidance or protection), an Irda or Mischta may cry out for aid and there is a 15% chance that a wisdom spirit will appear. This cry may be made once in an individual&rsquo;s lifetime. A wisdom spirit appears to be identical to Igrane, a tall, wise, middle-aged Irda in simple clothing. One cannot tell that it is a spirit unless a <i>detect magic</i> spell is used.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Wisdom spirits are not effective combatants. They prefer to use their spells in combat; they have the spell capabilities of a 20th-level wizard and a 20th-level cleric (with 20 Wisdom and Intelligence). They never use spells that cause damage or physical injury.</p>

<p>The sight of a wisdom spirit forces all non-Irda and non-Mischta to roll successful saving throws vs. wand or run away in fear for 3d4 rounds, dropping whatever they have in their hands.</p>

<p>The touch of a wisdom spirit causes a victim to be pacified &mdash; he cannot perform violent or hostile actions for 2d6 rounds, unless he is attacked, in which case he may defend himself.</p>

<p>If a wisdom spirit is damaged in combat, it immediately <i>plane shifts</i> away (it can move freely within and between the planes). If the damage done to a wisdom spirit in one round exceeds its hit points, the spirit is dispelled; it reforms in 50 years. If all eight spirits are dispelled, then Igrane&rsquo;s spirit is irrevocably destroyed.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Wisdom spirits inhabit any place frequented by Irda or Mischta. There are legends among the Irda of a strange man who approaches the young and teaches them; these teachers are wisdom spirits. Wisdom spirits do not discriminate against other creatures, but their glory fills other species with fear.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Wisdom spirits are not a part of the natural order. They do not feed on creatures, nor are they part of the food chain.</p>

<p>Wisdom spirits have no treasure or magic. They offer advice to creatures of good alignment, and cast healing spells in exchange for a promise from that character to protect or assist any Irda or Mischta he encounters.</p>
