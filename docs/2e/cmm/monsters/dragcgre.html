<p class="f">Green <a href="dragon.html">dragons</a> are bad tempered, mean, cruel, and rude. They hate goodness and good-aligned creatures. They love intrigue and seek to enslave other woodland creatures, killing those who cannot be controlled or intimidated.</p>

<p>A hatchling green dragon&rsquo;s scales are thin, very small, and a deep shade of green that appears nearly black. As the dragon ages, the scales grow larger and become lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green, which helps it blend in with its wooded surroundings. A green dragon&rsquo;s scales never become as thick as other dragons&rsquo;, remaining smooth and flexible.</p>

<p>Green dragons speak their own tongue, a tongue common to all evil dragons, and 12% of hatchling green dragons have an ability to communicate with any intelligent creature. The chance to possess this ability increases 5% per age category of the dragon.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Green dragons initiate fights with little or no provocation, picking on creatures of any size. If the target creature intrigues the dragon or appears to be difficult to deal with, the dragon will stalk the creature, using its environment for cover, until it determines the best time to strike and the most appropriate tactics to use. If the target appears formidable, the dragon will first attack with its breath weapon, magical abilities, and spells. However, if the target appears weak, the dragon will make its presence known quickly for it enjoys evoking terror in its targets. When the dragon has tired of this game, it will bring down the creature using its physical attacks so the fight lasts longer and the creature&rsquo;s agony is prolonged.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the dragon elects to control a creature, such as a human or demi-human, through intimidation and suggestion. Green dragons like to question men, especially adventurers, to learn more about their society, abilities, what is going on in the countryside, and if there is treasure nearby.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Breath Weapon/Special Abilities:</b> A green dragon&rsquo;s breath weapon is a cloud of poisonous chlorine gas that is 50&rsquo; long, 40&rsquo; wide, and 30 feet high. Creatures within the cloud may save versus breath weapon for half damage. A green dragon casts its spells at 6th level, adjusted by its combat modifier.</p>

<p>From birth, green dragons are immune to gasses. As they age, they gain the following additional powers:</p>

<p><i>Juvenile:</i> <i>water breathing</i>. <i>Adult:</i> <i>suggestion</i> once a day. <i>Mature adult:</i> <i>warp wood</i> three times a day. <i>Old:</i> <i>plant growth</i> once a day. <i>Very old:</i> <i>entangle</i> once a day. Wyrm: <i>pass without trace</i> three times a day.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Green dragons are found in sub-tropical and temperate forests, the older the forest and bigger the trees, the better. The sights and smells of the woods are pleasing to the dragon, and it considers the entire forest or woods its territory. Sometimes the dragon will enter into a relationship with other evil forest-dwelling creatures, which keep the dragon informed about what is going on in the forest and surrounding area in exchange for their lives. If a green dragon lives in a forest on a hillside, it will seek to enslave <a href="gianhill.html">hill giants</a>, which the dragon considers its greatest enemy. A green dragon makes its lair in underground chambers far beneath its forest.</p>

<p>The majority of green dragons encountered will be alone. However, when a mated pair of dragons and their young are encountered, the female will leap to the attack. The male will take the young to a place of safety before joining the fight. The parents are extremely protective of their young, despite their evil nature, and will sacrifice their own lives to save their offspring.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Although green dragons have been known to eat practically anything, including shrubs and small trees when they are hungry enough, they especially prize elves. If the forest is on a hillside, hill giants will hunt the younger dragons, which they consider a delicacy.</p>
