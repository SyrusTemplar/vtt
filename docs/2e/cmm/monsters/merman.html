<p class="f">Mermen are marine-dwelling, amphibious humanoids with the upper torso of a human and the lower torso of a <a href="fish.html">fish</a>.</p>

<p>Mermen were once human but were transformed by unknown powers into their current forms. They live by herding fish, but during times of need they attack other sea-peoples or ocean-going vessels. They live underwater but surface to sun themselves on large rocks.</p>

<p>Adult mermen are 5 to 6 feet long (tall) and weigh between 150 and 225 pounds. Their skin tone is fair to tan, hair color is usually dark brown (occasionally fair), while their scale color ranges from green to silver. Females, also known as mermaids, are 6 inches shorter than the males and weigh between 100 to 150 pounds. Mermen adorn themselves with coral and shell decorations. Mermen speak their own language (with different dialects spoken by communities that are separated over wide distances), and 50% of all communities also speak <a href="locathah.html">locathah</a>.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Mermen communities are well-armed. The arms used by mermen are as follows:</p>
  <ul><li>Trident, dagger (50%)*</li><li>Crossbow, dagger (30%)</li><li>Javelin, dagger (20%)</li></ul>

<p class="ni"><small>* 20% of all trident wielders are also armed with a hook and grappling line (50 feet long).</small></p>

<p>Mermen crossbows have a range of 30 yards underwater. They use grapples to attack ships; the grapples can be thrown up to 50 feet. Each grapple held by 10 mermen slows a ship by 1. Once stopped, the ship is attacked and a hole is knocked in its hull in 4d4 rounds, after which the ship slowly sinks, to be looted by the mermen.</p>

<p>Merman suffer double damage from fire attacks.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> For every 20 mermen encountered, there is a patrol leader (2-3 HD) and 1-3 <a href="barracud.html">barracuda</a> (AC 6; Move 30; HD 3; #AT 1; Dmg 2d4). For every 40 mermen, there is a leader (4 HD). For every 120 mermen encountered, there is one chief (6 HD) and two guards (4 HD). For every ten mermen, there is a 10% chance of a shaman (3 HD, with the spells of a 3rd-level priest).</p>

<p>Mermen have regular undersea communities, usually a reef or cliff honeycombed with passages. Rarely (10% of the time) they construct a village from sea shells and coral. An average community has between 100 and 600 males. Females and sub-adults each equal 100% of the males in a village. The communities are usually guarded by 3d6 trained barracudas.</p>

<p>Mermen society is heavily patriarchal. They prefer to be left to themselves and usually reject proposals of friendship or trade. They have strong territorial instincts and, while closely related to humans, they have no love for them. Males hunt and herd fish and protect their territory. Females raise children and tend to domestic affairs. Mermaids are also known for their creativity, and they produce works of art for the community (shell carvings, seaweed tapestries, and songs).</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Mermen are omnivorous, but they prefer a diet of fish, lobster, crab, and shellfish. They do not cook these creatures, but must fillet them before eating. They can survive out of water for one hour before they begin to dehydrate. When dehydrated, they lose 2 hit points per hour and will die when they reach zero; immersion in fresh or salt water immediately restores these lost hit points.</p>

<p>Mermen have an average life expectancy of 150 years. Mermen have many natural enemies but particularly hate the <a href="triton.html">tritons</a> over territory.</p>
