<p class="f">These disgusting <a href="leech.html">leeches</a> lurk in ponds, swamps, or other wet areas, waiting to drain the mental energies of any psionicists unlucky enough to wander into their midst.</p>

<p>Physically they look little different from their <a href="leecmagi.html">magical</a> or natural cousins, save for a distinctive bluish tinge to their rubbery black hide and the faint aura of crimson light that can be seen to surround them in darkness.</p>

<p>Psionic leeches do not have ability to communicate with other creatures.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Psionic leeches drain mental energy in much the same way that magical leeches drain the mystical powers of wizards and priests. Because psionic energy is much less common than magical energy in the realm of Ravenloft, psionic leeches have become very efficient parasites, Every leech can drain 1 Psionic Strength Point per turn from any creature within 1 yard.</p>

<p>Detecting a psionic leech is difficult as their slow absorption of energy isn&rsquo;t likely to alert most victims. The percentage chance that a character will notice the drain is equal to the number of psionic points stolen by the parasites. The victim should be allowed to attempt this check once per turn.</p>

<p>Once alerted, the host will still have to find the creatures if the drain is to be halted. This can be difficult as the foul creatures crawl into the wrinkles of clothing, downturned cuffs, boots, or even the joints of armor. Finding each leech requires an intelligence check and takes 1 round.</p>

<p>Removing the creatures from their chosen hiding place is even more difficult than finding them. When touched, psionic leeches release their energy in the form of a psychic blast that causes 1 point of damage for every PSP stolen by the leech in the last 8 hours. Mental defenses such as <i>tower of iron will</i> or <i>mindblank</i> can reduce the draining effects of the leech or the damage caused by its psychic blast by half.</p>

<p>Psionic leeches are able to sense the mind of a psionicist even when he has expended all of his PSPs. This does not deter the creatures from attempting to feed upon that mind. When this happens, the target must make a madness check each round. Only one check is required, no matter how many leeches are attempting to feed upon his depleted mind.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Psionic leeches have no communal structure, but are generally found in groups of 5-30 (5d6) members. They prefer wetlands like swamps and marshes, but can also be found in open ponds, wet grasses, or slow-moving streams. Anyone passing through one of their nests will pick up 1d6 of the parasites.</p>

<p>Psionic leeches have tiny hooks along the edges of their flat bodies that catch on clothing or fur. This allows them to cling to their host tenaciously, dropping off only when the psionic powers of the victim have been exhausted or a better source of food comes along.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Psionic leeches bloat with stolen energy until they become too large and fall from their host. At this point they slowly crawl to the nearest wetland and give birth to 1-6 more leeches in 3d4 days.</p>
