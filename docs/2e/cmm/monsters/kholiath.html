<p class="f">The kholiathra are cunning spirits, usually unseen, who keep watch on elven lands. They protect native <a href="elf.html">elves</a>, ward off lesser evils that stray too close, and avert minor accidents. Most elves are unaware of the kholiathra&rsquo;s existence, but these creatures are largely responsible for the good luck and happy existence of elven lands. In their natural state, kholiathra are slender and transparent humanoids with wispy glassy outlines.</p>

<p>They normally shun the company of others than themselves, but can speak elvish and the common tongue.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Kholiathra can become completely <i>invisible</i> at will. They move as easily through the air as they do on the ground, and can fly without effort.</p>

<p>A kholiathra&rsquo;s main power is the ability to provide either good or bad luck to those nearby. The presence of a kholiathra may either add or subtract 4 (at the kholiathra&rsquo;s discretion) to the roll of any individual within 20 feet. Only one roll per round is affected, but this may include attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and reaction and ability checks.</p>

<p>Otherwise, kholiathra generally do not fight, preferring to turn invisible and flee. If forced to fight, they can buffet enemies with invisible masses of force, causing 1d10 points of damage. Enemies striking at invisible kholiathra have a -4 penalty to their attack rolls.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Kholiathra tend to be found in small groups, often in association with elven communities.</p>

<p>As enchanted beings, kholiathra do not require food, drink, or other sources of mortal nourishment. They gain sustenance from sunlight, and often gather in meadows or other sunny areas. During these times, kholiathra are playful and carefree, cavorting and flying about. The sight of these beautiful creatures floating gracefully through the air, dancing and pirouetting, is a sight not easily forgotten.</p>

<p>They are positively inclined toward elves. Kholiathra enjoy living near elven groups or bands and using their powers to bring luck to chosen individuals.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Some claim that kholiathra are the spirits of departed elves returned to serve their communities. Elven gods ane said to send kholiathra to provide luck at births or during battles. It is certain that the island of Evermeet on Toril is under their protection.</p>

<p>Kholiathra are also found in numbers on the outer plane of Arborea, serving Sehanine and other Seldarine deities.</p>
