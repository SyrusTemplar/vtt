<p class="f">Canoloths&rsquo;re specialzed <a href="yugoloth.html">yugoloths</a> who serve as scouts, skirmishers, and trackers for the yugoloth mercanary companies. They&rsquo;re not as common as the <a href="yugomezz.html">mezzoloths</a> or <a href="yugoderg.html">dergholoths</a> that make up the bulk of these units, but a couple of canoloths can greatly increase the effectiveness of a yugoloth company by providing the <a href="yugopisc.html">piscoloth</a> or <a href="yugonyca.html">nycaloth</a> commanders with excelent intelligence and reconnaissance reports.</p>

<p>Canoloths resemble great semi-instectile mastiffs, their hulking forms plated in chitinous armor. Their bodies&rsquo;ve got a distinctly bull<a href="dog.html">dog</a>like shape to them, with massive jaws and short, squat, forelegs. Their mouths are made up of both a horizontal set ot teeth and a vertical set of teeth just behind, and a vile barbed tongue often lolls out of the creature&rsquo;s mouth. The canoloth&rsquo;s nostrils&rsquo;re gaping wounds in the front of its skull, and it has no eyes &mdash; it relies on its uncanny senses of smell and hearing to find its quarry.</p>

<p>Canoloths can communicate with semi-intelligent or higher creatures by means of an innate power of telepathy.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Canoloths&rsquo;re never surprised. Their smell and hearing give them the equivalent of normal vision to a range of 240 feet, and darkness or normal invisibility don&rsquo;t hinder their perception in the slightest. However, tenches such as a <i>stinking cloud</i>, <i>cloudkill</i>, or a pot of burning naphtha can &ldquo;blind&rdquo; a canoloth when accompanied by very loud noises. (Routine yelling or screaming won&rsquo;t cut it.) Canoloths won&rsquo;t be affected by any spell that uses a visual effect, such as <i>glitterdust</i>, <i>phantasmal force</i>, <i>hypnotic pattern</i>, and the like.</p>

<p>Canoloths attack with two slashes of their stubby foreclaws for 1d6 points of damage each, and a bite of their horryfying jaws that inflict 6-15 (3d4+3) points of damage. The canoloth&rsquo;s powerful mandibles destroy its victim&rsquo;s armor on a natural attack roll of 19 or 20, but magical armor gains a saving throw versus crushing blow to avoid this effect.</p>

<p>In place of its melee attacks, a canoloth can instead use its barbed tongue to entangle its prey. The creature&rsquo;s tongue can strike targets up to 20 feet away and works much like the tongue of a frog or chameleon. The strike inflicts 1d6 points of damage if the cnnoloth hits, and the victim must survive a saving throw versus paralyzation or be helplessly entangled on the wicked barbs and sticky slime of the canoloth&rsquo;s tongue.</p>

<p>The canoloth can draw its victim back to its mouth and automatically hit with its bite attack in the next round; the victim has to make a bend bars/lift gates roll to resist being drawn to the yugoloth. If the victim&rsquo;s friends try to pull him free, they&rsquo;ll need a combined total of 34 Strength points to disentangle him from the tongue. Optionally, the tongue can be attackes with Type S weapons; it&rsquo;s AC 4 and has 15 hit points.</p>

<p>Canoloths suffer no damage from add, magical or normal fire, iron weapons, or poison and only half damage from poisonous gas. They suffer double damage from cold-based attacks. Like all yugoloths, they can use the spell-like powers of <i>alter self</i>, <i>cause disease</i>, <i>charm person</i>, <i>improved phantasmal force</i>, <i>produce flame</i>, and <i>teleport without error</i>. In addition, canoloths can also use the following abilities one at a time at will: <i>cloudkill</i> (1/day), <i>darkness 15&rsquo; radius</i>, <i>fear</i>, <i>passwall</i>, and <i>shout</i> (1/day). Once per day the canoloths can <i>gate</i> 1 to 4 additional canoloths or 1 to 3 mezzoloths with a 50% chance of success.</p>

<p>Canoloths can be struck only by weapons of +1 or better enchantment.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Although canoloths&rsquo;re a,ong the weakest yugoloths, they&rsquo;re considered valuable by the leaders of the yugoloth armies. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for greater yugoloths to have several canoloths at their beck and call; canoloths make excellent guards, assassins or retrievers. Their lack of intelligence makes canoloths the most loyal of the race, and they&rsquo;ll follow the orders of their masters to the death &mdash; a rare trait among the lesser yugoloths.</p>

<p>Canoloths are well aware of their favored status and use it to bully and pester mezzoloths or hydroloths. When they&rsquo;re not employed with a mercenary company, canoloths spend their time bounding through the foul wastes of the Lower Planes in search of lesser creatures to torment and slay.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not unusual to see canoloths saddled and used as great, fearsome mounts by arcanaloths or ultroloths.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> It&rsquo;s thought that canoloths&rsquo;re created from particularly courageous mezzoloths, but there&rsquo;s little to substantiate this. The creatures&rsquo;re common on the Gray Waste and Gehenna. Some spells of binding and entrapment make use of a piece of the tongue of a canolnth; the organ&rsquo;ll bring about 1,000 gp in the right market.</p>
