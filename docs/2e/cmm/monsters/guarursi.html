<p class="f">The scholars and philosophers of the <a href="guardina.html">guardinals</a> are the ursinals, benevolent beings who resemble huge men and women with distinctive bearlike attributes. They&rsquo;re advisers to the <a href="guarleon.html">leonals</a>, and the record-keepers and magic-users of their race. Ursinals are open with their knowledge but love to digress endlessly and often free-associate through many iterations until they&rsquo;re holding forth on a subject with no relation to the original topic.</p>

<p>Ursinals stand 8 feet tall, with thick-set bodies. They&rsquo;re covered with light golden, red, or golden-brown fur that&rsquo;s long on their forearms, backs, and lower legs and too fine to see on their torsos and faces. An ursinal&rsquo;s face has a pronounced muzzle and high ear-tufts, but its expression is kindly. It&rsquo;s very difficult to move an ursinal to anger, but the powers pity the poor sod who manages the trick &mdash; it&rsquo;s said that a fighting-mad ursinal can tear his way through any three <a href="gehrelet.html">gehreleths</a>.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Ursinals dislike combat and avoid physical confrontations until they become inevitable. However, a body&rsquo;d be wise to watch out when the ursinal finally decides to stand his ground. An ursinal&rsquo;s as strong as a hill giant (Strength 19) and can dish out terrible damage with his sharp-clawed paws. If an ursinal hits an enemy with both paws, he can automatically hug his victim for an additional 2d10 points of damage and gains a +4 bonus to his bite attack against the hugged victim.</p>

<p>Ursinals&rsquo;re skillful mages and have the spell powers of a wizard of level 9 to 16 (d8+8). They prefer spells of enchantment, misdirection, or divination, and rarely memorize many heavy-damage spells. Of course, under the right circumstances, an ursinal&rsquo;ll make use of any spell in his books. They&rsquo;re also fond of magical items such as rings, rods, or wands, and miscellaneous magic that enhances their spell-casting ability.</p>

<p>Like the other guardinals, ursinals have several spell-like powers that can be used once per round: <i>continual light</i>, <i>ESP</i>, <i>hold monster</i>, <i>know alignment</i>, <i>polymorph self</i>, <i>magic missile</i> (5 missiles), <i>sleep</i> (4d6 Hit Dice worth, affects creatures up to 7 HD), or <i>create solid fog</i>. An ursinal can <i>cure disease</i>, <i>heal</i>, or <i>neutralize poison</i> three times per day, and once per day he can speak a <i>holy word</i>. Once per year the ursinal can grant a<i>limited wish</i>.</p>

<p>Ursinals can be hit only by silver weapons or those that have been enchanted to +3 or better. They&rsquo;re never surprised in Elysium.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> The advice of an ursinal is a much sought-after commodity. As librarians, scholars, and record-keepers, they carefully catalogue and sort all manner of information. They&rsquo;re especially knowledgeable about magical matters and also have a keen interest in prime-material histories and linguistics. In Elysium it&rsquo;s said that if an ursinal doesn&rsquo;t know something, he knows where to go to find out.</p>

<p>Ursinals are solitary creatures, but almost all are linked by constant correspondence and magical communications. They&rsquo;re also fond of the company of lesser guardinals or petitioners who can &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; from the ursinal&rsquo;s wisdom. Some view ursinals as intrusive busybodies, but most of their advice is strikingly accurate and always well intended.</p>
