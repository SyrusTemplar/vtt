<p class="f">A manotaur somewhat resembles a <a href="gianhill.html">hill giant</a>.
</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Because of its superior senses of smell and hearing, a manotaur is surprised only on a 1 in 10 chance. Since manotaurs run with absolute silence through their woodland lairs, opponent surprise rolls are at a -3 penalty. A manotaur will typically charge if it surprises an opponent.</p>

<p>A manotaur attacks using its two front hooves and its razor sharp horns. Anytime in combat that a manotaur can run 20 feet or more in a straight line, it can charge. When charging, a manotaur attacks only with its horns but the damage is tripled (3d8). In addition, man-sized or smaller targets are slammed back ten feet by the force of the charge and might he knocked down.</p>

<p>Manotaurs are intelligent opponents that rely upon brute force when battling smaller creatures and guile against wellarmed foes. A common ploy by manotaurs is to surprise the opponent, deliver a single charge attack, then disappear into the forest. A manotaur repeats this tactic time and time again, slowly wearing down the foe before closing for the kill.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Manotaurs are evil by nature, hating all good things. Their lairs are usually overgrown, desolate forests, in which they gallop to and fro, beating out a series of twisted interlocking paths with their hooves. These paths are known only to the manotaur who lives there. Any creature attempting to follow the paths in a manotaur forest is 75% likely to become disoriented and unable to find its way back out of the forest. Aperson trapped in a manotaur forest has only a 10% chance per day of finding his way out without magical aid. At seemingly random points, the forest&rsquo;s paths straighten out for as much as 30 feet at a time. This is where the manotaur will wait, timing his charge to hit just as the victim rounds the bend and steps onto the straightened path.</p>

<p>The personalities of manotaurs vary widely; some guard their forest jealously, killing all who dare enter. Others fill the woodland with wicked creatures, such as <a href="orc.html">orcs</a>, and even an occasional ogre or two. They use these creatures to spread terror though the forest and as spies in the outside world.</p>

<p>A manotaur colt is born with 2 Hit Dice. The colt remains with its father until it reaches 5 Hit Dice. At that point it is driven out of the forest. A manotaur colt that reenters its father&rsquo;s forest is immediately slain.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Manotaurs hunt sylvan creatures (<a href="unicorn.html">unicorns</a> and can sense them anywhere in their forests. The only time two manotaurs will cooperate is to track down and destroy a unicorn.</p>

<p>Manotaurs sometimes use treasure to lure creatures into their maze of paths, placing a gold piece here and a silver there. Humans and demihumam who carefully map may he able to pick up a quick silver piece or two, but even a short journey into the forest can lead to disaster. The bulk of a manotaur&rsquo;s treasure is hidden either beneath a great stone or in a tree hollow near the center of the forest.</p>

<p>The origins of the first manotaur are a mystery; possibly it was the offspring of a minotanr and a human female. Manotaurs live 300 years or more.</p>
