<p class="f">Theiwar are an aggressive and degenerate race of mountain dwarves.</p>

<p>Theiwar are human-like in appearance, but shorter and slightly more muscular. Their features are exaggerated and repulsive. Huge bulging eyes, gray or watery blue in color, dominate their faces. Their hair is pale tan or yellow. Their skin is bone white with bluish undertones. They prefer dark, loose clothing.</p>

<p>Theiwar are most active at night. Sunlight makes them nauseated. They have poor infravision (30-foot range). Theiwar consider themselves to be the highest of all dwarven races and seek to dominate all of Krynn.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Theiwar usually attack in teams of three, hiding to ambush their opponents from behind. Two Theiwar strike the victim&rsquo;s legs, while the third aims his weapon at the victim&rsquo;s head. A solitary Theiwar will avoid attacking a victim larger than himself, but if necessary, he will attempt to strike from behind.</p>

<p>Savant Theiwar will also attack from a concealed position, but they use spells such as <i>lightning bolt</i>, <i>cloudkill</i>, and <i>ice storm</i> to weaken their victims before closing to finish them off with melee weapons.</p>

<p>Theiwar employ a variety of weapons. Their favorites are repeating light crossbows (12-foot maximum range, two shots per round, six-bolt capacity, 1d3 points of damage). Theiwar poison on the arrows inflicts an additional 2d6 points of damage unless the victim succeeds in a saving throw vs. poison. Other common weapons include hooked fauchards (1d4 points of damage and 25% likely to pull a man-sized or smaller victim off-balance), spiked bucklers (1d4 points of damage), Theiwar aklyses (four-foot-long spiked and hooked weapons that inflict 1d6 points of damage and are 15% likely to pull a man-sized of smaller victim off-balance), and daggers. They usually wear leather armor but sometimes use chain mail (AC 5).</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Theiwar inhabit great subterranean realms. Their cities are often adjacent to those of other dwarven races, two of their largest strongholds are part of the <a href="dwarmoun.html">Hylar</a>-dominated kingdom of Thorbardin. About 40-50% of a group of Theiwar are children and females. An average group of 15 adult male Theiwar includes six 1st-level fighters, two 2nd- to 4th-level fighters, two 5th-level or higher fighters, one savant Theiwar, two student savants, and two paladins and thieves of various levels. Additionally, there is a 30% chance of 30.member group having a 5d8 slaves (0-level humans).</p>

<p>Savant Theiwar have an inherent ability to use magic. They are either fighters, priests, or thieves of 5th to 8th level, and they know 1d4+5 of the following spells all at the 12th level of ability; <i>affect normal fires</i>, <i>anti-magic shell</i>, <i>blink</i>, <i>charm person</i>, <i>cloudkill</i>, <i>ESP</i>, <i>hypnotic pattern</i>, <i>ice storm</i>, <i>inoisibility</i>, <i>levitate</i>, <i>light</i>, <i>lighting bolt</i>, <i>minor creation</i>, <i>repulsion</i>, <i>shadow</i>, <i>magic</i>, <i>spider climb</i>, <i>ventriloquism</i>, <i>wall of fog</i>, <i>wall of force</i>. Apprentice savants, called students, are level 4-7. Savants have two or three magical items while students have only one item. Typical magical items include any potion or scroll; <i>rings of fire resistance</i>, <i>invisibility</i>, or <i>spell storing</i>; any wand, <i>studded leather +1</i> or <i>shield +1</i>; any sword with +3 bonus; <i>bracers of defense</i>; <i>brooch of shielding</i>; <i>cloak of protection</i>. Students are only 25% likely to be able to use a non fighter magical item.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> <a href="dwardaer.html">Daergar</a> are the only dwarven race that socialize with the Theiwar. Theiwar hate all other races, particularly humans. Though they can eat all types of food, Theiwar prefer to eat meat raw or cooked. Warrior Theiwar are rumored to eat humans during drunken festivals.</p>
