<p class="f">It shouldn&rsquo;t be any surprise that there are <a href="eladrin.html">eladrins</a> who devote themselves to art, music, and magic. The firres (pronounced <i>feers</i>) are creatures who live for beauty; their lives are consumed by a fiery passion for art of any kind, and they strive to make their own existence a living image of wonder and delight.</p>

<p>The firre eladrins live as wandering minstrels and bards in Arborea, attending the courts of more powerful eladrins or tarrying to entertain a circle of coures in a forgotten dell. Their pursuit of beauty leads them to any place where art, skill, or grace is held in high esteem. A body could run across a firre traveling the Outlands or visiting the palaces of neutral-aligned powers just as easily as he&rsquo;d find one in Arborea. Firres have a deep love and appreciation of mortal art, and often embark on lengthy sojourns on the Prime Material Plane to seek out works of excellence.</p>

<p>In their natural form, firre eladrins resemble stocky <a href="elfhalf.html">half-elf</a>, but her eyes give her away; they have no iris or pupil, and glow brightly with the firre&rsquo;s inner flame. Firres can also transform themselves into man-size pillars or balls of fire; in this form they can fly at the listed rate.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Like the <a href="eladlcou.html">coures</a>, firres often use weapons in their demihuman form. They&rsquo;re far stronger than they look and possess an 18/00 Strength. Firres favor long, wavy-bladed swords equal to <i>two-handed swords +3</i>. They also may use slender javelins that become blazing bolts of fire when thrown, inflicting damage as a <i>javelin +5</i>. (The javelin&rsquo;s consumed in the throw, but many firre carry up to four.) A creature that meets the fiery glance of an angry firre must successfully save versus paralyzation or be blinded for 2d10 rounds, suffering 1d10 points of damage.</p>

<p>In her fiery form, a firre can strike twice per round for 3d6 points of damage per attack. Any creature within 10 feet of the burning firre must make a successful save versus spell or suffer 1d6 points of damage from the heat. Any weapon that strikes a fiery firre must survive an item saving throw versus magical fire or be destroyed, although the firre still takes damage from a successful hit.</p>

<p>In any shape, the firre eladrin radiates <i>protection from evil</i> in a 10-foot radius. The firre can also use the following spell-like powers once per round at will: <i>advanced illusion</i>, <i>affect normal fires</i>, <i>continual light</i>, <i>detect invisibility</i>, <i>ESP</i>, <i>improved invisibility</i>, <i>polymorph self</i>, <i>wall of fire</i>, or cast a 10d6 <i>fireball</i>. Once per day the firre can create a <i>prismatic spray</i>. In addition to these spell-like powers, the firre has the spell ability of a 9th-level priest.</p>

<p>In demihuman form, the firre can choose to sing instead of attack. Her unearthly voice functions as a <i>charm</i>, <i>hold</i>, <i>sleep</i>, or <i>suggestion</i> spell on any creature within 50 feet. (The firre chooses the exact effect.) Any listeners must successfully save versus spell or be affected, The firre&rsquo;s <i>sleep</i> song can affect creatures normally unaffected by <i>sleep</i> spells.</p>

<p>Firres can be hit only by weapons of +2 or greater enchantment, or cold-wrought iron weapons. They suffer normal &mdash; not doubled &mdash; damage from such weapons.</p>
