<p class="f">Creatures killed by <a href="wraith.html">wraiths</a>, malevolent spirits of the sands.</p>

<p>These creatures have two forms &mdash; that of a human and that of a <a href="jackal.html">jackal</a>. Their goal is to destroy any living creature that they encounter.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> The desert wraith shifts between its two forms as it sees fit; it uses its jackal form to charge at its prey, then transforms itself into human form to attack. The human form inflicts 1d4 points of damage on a touch and drains the victim of one life level (no saving throw allowed), as per a wraith, with appropriate reductions in hit points, spell abilities, etc.</p>

<p>A desert wraith is undead and can be turned, on the same column as a spectre. Daylight destroys them utterly, and holy water inflicts 2d4 points of damage per vial.</p>

<p>While they have only low intelligence, they are capable of cunning (e.g., burying themselves in the sand, then attacking their prey by surprise).</p>

<p>They can see in total darkness as if it were noon.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> A desert wraith is totally evil. It lives only to feed off the life forces of others. Desert wraiths dig barrows for themselves in the sand; they retreat to these during the day.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Desert wraiths feed off life force energy. No creatures exist that prey on them. Creatures brought to 0 life levels by a desert wraith are transformed into <a href="zombie.html">zombies</a> within 48 hours, even if raised, unless their bodies are washed in holy water.</p>
