<p class="f">The nightmare of <a href="golem.html">golem</a> is constructed by dwarf priests, using a process as rare and carefully guarded as the manufacture of the most powerful dwarven magical weapons.</p>

<p>A hammer golem stands about 9 feet tall and weighs about 2,000 lbs. It resembles a gigantic stone dwarf (beard included) covered in adamantite plate mail. Its forearms have been replaced by two weapons &mdash; a hammer on the right arm and a pickaxe or axe on the left.</p>

<p>A hammer golem moves heavily and slowly. When encountering orcs and their kin, it gives out a hollow roar as it attack, but otherwise does not communicate in any way.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> This golem attacks only if ordered to do so by its master, if it encounters orcs, or if it is kept from its assigned task. The latter condition allows it to attack if someone tries to get at what the golem is guarding, for example. The creature can remember as many commands as its creator wishes, but all commands may total up to no more than twice the creator&rsquo;s Wisdom in words.</p>

<p>When without a master, a hammer golem attacks anything in front of it until opponents flee, or they leave its charge alone, or they are dead. If the opponents are goblinoids, only their death or the golem&rsquo;s destruction will break off its attack.</p>

<p>This golem attacks first with its hammer hand, inflicting 2d10 points of damage, then with its pick for 2d12 points of damage. In addition, it can employ a special <i>pounding force</i> attack once per turn. This is similar to a <i>repulsion</i> spell, except that, in addition to the usual effects, it inflicts 4d6 points of damage. If the victim makes a successful saving throw vs. spell, only half damage is sustained.</p>

<p>While all golems are immune to mind-affecting spells, a hammer golem is virtually immune to every spell except for <i>wish</i>, which affects the golem normally, and <i>stone to flesh</i>, which acts as a <i>heal</i> spell on the hammer golem. In addition. a weapon of +1 or greater magical power is required to hit this golem. Of course, hammer golems are not affected by poison of any type.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> As mentioned, hammer golems are made by dwarf priests, to be employed as guards, warriors, or massive miners (they can tunnel through solid rock at MV 6). While most hammer golems possess an axe on the left arm as described above, one designed specifically for mining has pickaxes on both appendages.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Hammer golems contribute nothing to deep-earth ecology (or any other), except for the destruction of <a href="goblin.html">goblins</a> and the mining of minerals.</p>
