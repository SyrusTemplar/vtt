<p class="f">Quills are natural animals native to some of the most inhospitable reaches of the Great Wheel. They&rsquo;re common enough in grassland or scrub all over the Outlands, but they&rsquo;re also found in places where it doesn&rsquo;t seem possible for a herbivore to exist. A body can run across a quill in the howling tunnels of Pandemonium, the iron battle-plains of Acheron, the fiery waste of Avernus, or the war-torn Plain of Infinite Portals.</p>

<p>A sharp basher can make a meal of a quill when his rations&rsquo;re running low and there&rsquo;s nothing else to eat. He&rsquo;s just got to be a little careful about catching his dinner.</p>

<p>Quills look like large <a href="porcupin.html">porcupines</a>, but their spiny hide alternates with bands of tough, thick, leathery skin like an armadillo&rsquo;s. A quill&rsquo;s spines are much larger and more dexterous than a porcupine&rsquo;s &mdash; each clump is rooted in a small but powerful muscle that can twitch and agitate the spines with surprising strength and speed. The creature&rsquo;s tail is long and strong, with a dense clump of spines at the end. The quill&rsquo;s been known to kill a human in mail armor with a single blow of its tail.</p>

<p>Quills are voracious foragers and grazers who&rsquo;ll chew their way through anything given enough time. They&rsquo;ll eat <a href="baatspin.html">spinagons</a> or <a href="imp.html">imps</a> are better off looking for an easier meal.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Combat:</b> Quills don&rsquo;t normally initiate combat. When they encounter anything that looks human or demihuman, they&rsquo;re inclined to keep a moderate distance and go about their business. If some addle-cove persists in trying to get too close, the quill&rsquo;s first lines of defense are its throwing spines. Each round, the quill can fire 1 to 4 spines at any target within 20 feet, with a THACO of 20 (they&rsquo;re not terribly accurate with fired spines.) The spines each inflict 1 to 3 points of damage per hit, and stick in the victim. (See below.)</p>

<p>If that doesn&rsquo;t deter an aggressor, the quill defends itself with its bite and its tail lash. The bite&rsquo;s not much to worry about, but the tail&rsquo;s capable of killing a full-grown human. A blow from the tail inflicts 1d6+1 points of damage, and leaves 0 to 3 (1d4- 1) spines stuck in the victim. The quill can&rsquo;t fire spines and make its melee attacks in the same round.</p>

<p>Attacking the quill bare-handed or with natural weaponry&rsquo;s a bad idea. Each time the attacker scores a hit, the quill counterattacks with 1d4+1 spines, which each inflict 1 to 3 points of damage per hit. Even striking the creature with a hand-held melee weapon creates a counterattack of 0 to 3 spines (1d4-1). These incidental attacks strike with a THAC0 of 20, and any spines that hit stick in their target. The quill can be safely attacked with missiles or thrown weapons.</p>

<p>Fighting a quill&rsquo;s likely to mean that the attacker has a few spines stuck in him by the end of the combat. Quill spines are wickedly barbed. Removing a spine causes 1 goint of damage unless the character pulling the spine out passes an unmodified healing proficiency check or a Dexterity check at a -4 penalty. Leaving the spine in the wound prevents the wound from healing and activates a cumulative 10% chance per day that the wound festers. Festering wounds cause 1 point of damage per day per wound unless the victim survives a saving throw versus poison, and they continue to do so until the victim succeeds with three consecutive saves or is treated with <i>cure disease</i>.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Habitat/Society:</b> Quills usually gather in small family groups comprising a mated pair and several offspring of various ages. (Very young quills have just 1 Hit Die, and their spines are too soft to do any real damage, although they still hurt.) Quills aren&rsquo;t particularly aggressive or territorial, and quickly withdraw from a confrontation with a predator.</p>

<p>Quill spines can be modified for use as blowgun darts or other light weapons. With a successful check of the armorer proficiency, a basher could fix spines to his armor anywhere he&rsquo;s wearing a level plate, such as his shoulders, knees, or elbows. The DM can decide how effective a deterrent this might be &mdash; generally, the spines look dangerous but offer no measurable combat effect.</p>

<p class="f"><b>Ecology:</b> Quills&rsquo;re very useful because they take otherwise indigestible plant life and turn it into marginally digestible meat. Quill meat may not taste good, but it&rsquo;ll sustain life, and in some quarters of the Lower Planes, it&rsquo;s actually considered a delicacy. Quills are naturally reclusive and usually forage only by night, so they can be harder to find than a cutter&rsquo;d think.</p>

<p>Quills typically nest in labyrinthine earth burrows not much bigger than 1½ to 2½ feet in diameter. If they&rsquo;re anywhere near their burrow when danger threatens, they&rsquo;re likely to go to ground and wait it out. Even a determined fiend&rsquo;ll think twice about trying to pull a quill out of its burrow.</p>
