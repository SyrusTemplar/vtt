</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Although this chapter stands alone as a concise discourse on necromantic
priesthoods, there are a number of useful TSR products which serve as sources of
further inspiration on this topic. <I>The Complete Priest's Handbook</I>, a definitive work on creating priest characters, contains numerous examples
of different pantheons, priesthoods, priest kits, and the role-playing of
priest characters. The DM is referred to that resource for guidelines on creating
believable and properly motivated priest characters for the campaign.

For more information about specific death gods,<I> Legends and Lore</I> summarizes the deities and religions from eleven historical and fictional
pantheons. This fine book includes details about death priesthoods and their
granted powers.

For campaign-specific information about death priests, the DM should refer to
the <I>FORGOTTEN REALMS? Adventures</I> hardcover for detailed descriptions of various death gods (Cyric, Bhaal, and
Myrkul) and their specialty priests. The <I>GREYHAWK? Adventures</I> hardcover also contains a description of the death god Nerull and his
priesthood.
