This has to be a stout, strong pole, 10 feet long or so, to be of any real
use. It has notches cut into it at regular intervals (approximately every 2 feet)
to enable the thief to climb using it. It must be set at a suitable angle
against the wall, or else it cannot be employed. Thieves will not often have use for
such an item, but it has its uses for dealing with very slippery or smooth
surfaces, walls made with broken glass shards in the mortar, and similar unusual
cases.
