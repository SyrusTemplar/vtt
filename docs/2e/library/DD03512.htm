Exceeding the Spell Level Limit</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
If the DM agrees, a wizard character may learn and cast spells of a higher
level than he would normally be allowed to know. This blurs the line of spell
level distinctions, making the character’s exact level somewhat less important;
there will be spells a character can learn and use easily, as well as spells that
will be extremely costly and difficult for the character to use.
<P></P>
Before a character can memorize a spell that’s over his head, he has to learn
it first. This means that the character must find, purchase, or otherwise
stumble across a spell of the level in question and attempt a learn spells check to
see if he can master it. However, when a character is dabbling in matters
beyond his depth, his learn spells chance of success is <I>halved </I>for a spell one level higher than he should be able to use, and divided by <I>10 </I>for a spell two levels higher than the maximum normally allowed. If a
character does not succeed in learning the spell at this point, then he can try again
at the level that he normally gains the spell. Under no circumstances can a
character learn a spell three levels higher than his normal maximum—it’s just too
difficult, and he’ll have to study his art for a while longer before he can make
heads or tails of it. Also, because the spell is so difficult to learn, the
wizard must memorize it as a fixed magick.
<P></P>
If the character succeeds in learning the high-level spell, he can then select
it normally by using his spell points to memorize it. However, since the spell
is extraordinarily difficult for the character, he must pay <I>twice </I>the listed normal fixed magick cost to memorize it. For many low-level
characters, this will make the spell prohibitively expensive in any event; a 2nd-level
specialist wizard only has a total of 12 spell points available, so he could
just barely memorize a single 2nd-level spell of his specialty school. Note that
a 2nd-level mage just doesn’t have the points available to even try this feat.
<P></P>
Wizards of medium to high level have a better chance to use a spell that would
normally be out of reach for them. For example, a 6th-level wizard normally is
limited to 3rd-level spells, but with effort he can learn a 4th-level spell
and cast it for 30 spell points, which is twice the normal cost of 15 spell
points. Since a 6th-level mage has 55 spell points available, he actually has a few
points left over to select other spells—although it’s a very costly privilege!
<P></P>
Again, this is an optional rule, and the DM can decide to ignore it for his
campaign. Note that all level-based characteristics of a spell depend on the
caster’s true level, so even if a 3rd-level wizard somehow acquired a <I>fireball</I>, it would only do 3d6 damage. (And he wouldn’t have the points available to
memorize it, anyway.)
