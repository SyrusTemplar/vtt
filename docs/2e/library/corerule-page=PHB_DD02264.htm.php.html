By employing a<I> part water</I> spell, the priest is able to cause water or similar liquid to move apart,
thus forming a trough. The depth and length of the trough created by the spell
depends on the level of the priest. A trough 3 feet deep per caster level, by 30
yards wide, by 20 yards long per level is created. Thus at 12th level, the
priest would part water 36 feet deep by 30 yards wide by 240 yards long. The trough
remains as long as the spell lasts or until the priest who cast it opts to end
its effects. Existing currents appear to flow through the parted water,
although swimming creatures and physical objects such as boats do not enter the rift
without strenuous and deliberate effort. If cast underwater, this spell creates
an air cylinder of appropriate length and diameter. If cast directly on a water
elemental or other water-based creature, the creature suffers 48 points of
damage and must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or flee in panic for 3d4
rounds.

The material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol.
