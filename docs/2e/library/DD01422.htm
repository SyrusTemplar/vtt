definitions of each ability will be given.
<P></P>
The six ability scores are determined randomly by rolling six-sided dice to
obtain a score from 3 to 18. There are several methods for rolling up these
scores.

character's Strength ability score. Repeat this for Dexterity, Constitution,
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Chrisma, in that order. This method gives a range of scores from
3 to 18, with most results in the 9 to 12 range. Only a few characters have
high scores (15 and above), so you should treasure these characters.
