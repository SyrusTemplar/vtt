In a warrior-oriented campaign where magic exists at the normal <I>AD&amp;D?</I> game limits, magic is considered a scary thing which normal people don't
appreciate at all. Most wizards encountered in the campaign will be villains. The
ones who are friends of the PCs are mostly low-powered (low-level).
<P></P>
This follows the pattern of many sword-and-sorcery fiction series, where each
story's resolution comes down to a contest between the hero and his fighting
prowess vs. a dastardly wizard or magical creature and his spells.
<P></P>
In such a campaign, the DM will have to decide whether any player-character
can be a multi-class or dual-class hero with Wizard or Priest spells. It's all
right to have Ranger and Paladin characters, as they only acquire their spells
slowly, and after many experience levels . . . but the more magically potent
wizards and priests pose a bigger problem. Their magic is too handy and too
dependable; the DM has to make his magical villains even more powerful in order to
cope. In a campaign where PCs can't be priests or wizards, a much lower-level
magical villain will be much more effective against them.
<P></P>
For these reasons, if you're going to try running a warrior-oriented campaign
for the first time, we recommend that you not allow PCs to be priests or
wizards. You can always choose to add the option later on . . . but if you find that
you like the non-magical warrior arrangement, it's not so easy to remove the
PCs' magical abilities from a campaign where you've already allowed them.
