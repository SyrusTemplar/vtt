Duelists can also choose one of twelve types of attack:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>1 Normal Attack:</B> The duelist uses no unusual maneuvers, simply attempting to
<P></P>
land a normal blow with her weapon.
<P></P>
<B>2</B> <B>Shield Punch:</B> The duelist allocates one of her attacks to performing a shield
<P></P>
punch.
<P></P>
<B>3 Sap:</B> The duelist attempts to use her attack to knock her opponent unconscious.
<P></P>
<B>4 Pull/trip:</B> The duelist tries to use her weapon to hook or snare her opponent-s
<P></P>
legs and pull him off his feet. She must allocate an attack for this option.
<P></P>
<B>6 Offensive Disarm:</B> The character allocates an attack to the offensive disarm
<P></P>
option.
<P></P>
<B>7 Feint:</B> The character tries to draw out her opponent by faking an attack in one
<P></P>
location and then attacking somewhere else. The feint is particularly
effective
<P></P>
against ripostes and disarms, and therefore provides a +1 bonus against those
<P></P>
types
<P></P>
of attacks.
<P></P>
<B>8 Outside Attack:</B> The character tries to attack around her opponent-s guard,
<P></P>
striking to the side of a shield or at a sliding opponent. This maneuver
offers a +1
<P></P>
bonus against a shield block or a slide position. Flails are also very good
for this
<P></P>
and get a +1 attack bonus above and beyond any other bonuses for this maneuver.
<P></P>
<B>9 Riposte:</B> The character waits for her opponent to launch an attack and expose a
<P></P>
weakness, and then she strikes in return. A character who ripostes must wait
until
<P></P>
after her opponent has attacked before she can make her own attack in that
round.
<P></P>
However, the riposte maneuver offers a +1 bonus to hit against smashes, wild
<P></P>
swings, and outside attacks.
<P></P>
<B>10 Smash:</B> It-s not elegant, but beating down a weaker character-s defenses is a
<P></P>
legitimate tactic in a fight. This type of maneuver offers a +1 bonus to hit
versus
<P></P>
blocks and parrys.
<P></P>
<B>11 Close Attack:</B> The duelist tries to get inside her opponent-s guard and attack at
<P></P>
close range. This maneuver provides a +1 bonus against opponents with larger
<P></P>
weapons, but it cannot be used if the character-s own weapon size is larger
than
<P></P>
her opponent-s.
<P></P>
<B>12 Wild Swing:</B> Foregoing all thought of defense, the character tries to make as
<P></P>
many attacks as possible by raining a fusillade of blows on her opponent. Wild
<P></P>
swings gain a +1 bonus to attacks against normal defenses.
<P></P>
