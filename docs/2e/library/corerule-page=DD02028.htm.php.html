A <I>geas</I> spell places a magical command upon a creature (usually human or humanoid) to
carry out some service, or to refrain from some action or course of activity,
as desired by the spellcaster. The creature must be intelligent, conscious,
under its own volition, and able to understand the caster. While a geas cannot
compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that are likely to result in
certain death, it can cause almost any other course of action. The geased creature
must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed. Failure to do
so will cause the creature to grow sick and die within 1d4 weeks. Deviation from
or twisting of the instructions causes a corresponding loss of Strength points
until the deviation ceases. A geas can be done away with by a <I>wish</I> spell, but a <I>dispel magic</I> or <I>remove curse</I> spell will not negate it. Your DM will decide any additional details of a
geas, for its casting and fulfillment are tricky, and an improperly cast geas is
ignored.
