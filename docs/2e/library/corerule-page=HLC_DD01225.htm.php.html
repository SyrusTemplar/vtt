hide behind trees. However, the lay of the land determines what is possible
during a combat and what’s not. A forest choked with thick undergrowth offers lots
of cover and concealment, which generally makes it a good place for ambushes. A
forest’s trees and undergrowth also tends to restrict movement—especially
mounted movement—and missile fire. Likewise, a group of 10 archers can’t line up
shoulder-to-shoulder and deliver a devastating volley if the battle is taking
place in a five-foot-wide dungeon corridor.

Terrain is usually beyond the control of the participants, except that magic
can alter terrain or appear to alter it. A <I>move earth</I> spell, for example, can allow a commander to create just about any
battlefield layout desired. A<I> hallucinatory terrain</I> spell can prompt opponents to do foolish things, such as maneuvering to avoid
a marsh that really isn’t there or coming to a halt behind a pile of illusory
boulders that appear to offer good cover.

Even without magic, creatures who are prepared for a battle can choose where
to fight. The best possible defensive terrain offers the defenders cover while
forcing the attacker to approach in the open, preferably to spend a long time
exposed to attack before they can attack themselves. Castles are built the way
they are to exploit this concept: The cleared area around the castle offers
little or no cover. The castle’s moat and walls keep the attackers outside where
there is no cover, and the walls provide cover for the defenders.

Smart foes stay alert for opportunities that the terrain creates. The old
trick of hiding atop a cliff and rolling boulders down upon hapless travelers below
is a good example of this type of tactic. Player actions often create
less-obvious opportunities, however. For example, characters who decide to climb to a
canyon’s rim—to avoid having rocks dropped on them later—just might find
themselves attacked while they literally hang on for dear life.
