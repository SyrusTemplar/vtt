type of terrain and weather factors. Typical environments include arctic,
woodland, desert, steppe, mountain, or tropical. The character has basic survival
knowledge for that terrain type. Additional proficiency slots can be used to add
more types of terrain.
<P></P>
A character skilled in survival has a basic knowledge of the hazards he might
face in that land. He understands the effects of the weather and knows the
proper steps to lessen the risk of exposure. He knows the methods to locate or
gather drinkable water. He knows how to find basic, not necessarily appetizing,
food where none is apparent, thus staving off starvation. Furthermore, a character
with survival skill can instruct and aid others in the same situation. When
using the proficiency to find food or water, the character must roll a
proficiency check. If the check is failed, no more attempts can be made that day.
<P></P>
The survival skill in no way releases the player characters from the hardships
and horrors of being lost in the wilderness. At best it alleviates a small
portion of the suffering. The food found is barely adequate, and water is
discovered in minuscule amounts. It is still quite possible for a character with
survival knowledge to die in the wilderness. Indeed, the little knowledge the
character has may lead to overconfidence and doom!
