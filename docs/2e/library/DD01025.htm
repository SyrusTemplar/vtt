<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Pipes of the Sewers:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">These wooden pipes appear ordinary, but if the possessor learns the proper
tune, he can attract from 10-60 (1d6 x 10) giant rats (80%) or 30-180 (3d6 x 10)
normal rats (20%) if either or both are within 400 feet. For each 50-foot
distance the rats have to travel, there will be a one-round delay. The piper must
continue playing until the rats appear, and when they do so, they are 95% likely
to obey the piper so long as he continues to play. If for any reason the piper
ceases playing, the rats summoned will leave immediately. If they are called
again, it is 70% probable that they will come and obey, 30% likely that they will
turn upon the piper.
<P></P>
If the rats are under control of a creature such as a vampire, the piper's
chance of taking over control is 30% per round of piping. Once control is assumed,
there is a 70% chance of maintaining it if the other creature is actively
seeking to reassert its control.
