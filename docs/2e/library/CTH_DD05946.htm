<I>Zondervan leaned away from the thick oaken door regretfully. &quot;I can't hear a
word of what's being said in there,&quot; he said miserably. His mentor Raimen smiled
at him and reached into the voluminous folds of his robe. Hardly the time for
a conjuring trick, the miserable apprentice thought. But Raimen swiftly
flourished a polished bronze hemisphere topped with a cone, the open surface of the
hemisphere wrapped about with a thin metal mesh. With only the hint of a
flourish, he placed the end of the cone to his right ear and leaned closer to the door,
gently placing the mesh-covered surface to the wood. A smile with just the
slightest hint of smugness beamed from the older thief's face. &quot;Try again,&quot; Raimen urged his apprentice. Zondervan craned his neck closer and
placed the cone against his own ear. Now he could hear the Guildmaster's
voice—faintly, to be sure, but the words were clear enough . . .
<P></P>
&quot;Just one thing, Master,&quot; Zondervan said in a newly-respectful tone on the way
to the Footpad for an ale, &quot;what is the wire mesh for?&quot;
<P></P>
&quot;To keep the ear seekers out, of course.&quot; Raimen said mildly. &quot;The Guildmaster
is very fond of using them as a defense against snoopers.&quot;
<P></P>
&quot;But—but before you gave me the listening cone I . . . I tried to listen
anyway, I placed my ear against the door . . .,&quot; cried the apprentice, suddenly
aghast.
<P></P>
&quot;Indeed you did,'' Raimen replied coolly. &quot;Better nip off and see the clerics
for a </I>cure disease <I>spell. I get ten per cent of their fees in such cases, you know. See you
later, I trust . . .&quot;

</I> A wide variety of special equipment items are available for thieves if they
know where to look for them. This chapter details many such items. Many of these
will be specific to particular thief skills and are listed for each skill. The
use of lockpicks with the Open Locks skill is an obvious example. there are
also many miscellaneous items which thieves are particularly likely to find
useful in their work, and there is a full listing of these items also. A tabular
summary of likely prices and encumbrance values can be found at the end of this
chapter.
<P></P>
All this isn't to say that only thieves should be allowed to use the items
detailed here, of course. In some cases, other characters cannot use these items
effectively. Lockpicks are useless for picking locks in the hands of anyone but
a thief, for this skill is specifically (and exclusively) a thief skill. many
other items do not necessarily have such restricted use. For example, the use
of tar paper (see below for a full detailing of this) could potentially be
useful for characters other than thieves. But such an item is particularly likely to
be encountered in the subculture of thieves, and to be used by them when going
about their nefarious activities. Also, taking a lively interest in equipment
items which assist stealth, concealment, silent break-ins to places where you
shouldn't be, and suchlike is naturally part of the role-playing of thieves.
Brave, hardy warriors and pious priests really shouldn't be interested in such
matters!
<P></P>
In the full equipment listing below, it is entirely for the DM to determine
whether certain items may or may not be available in the campaign world. For
example, as noted in the <I>Player's Handbook</I>, combination locks may well not exist in a world based on medieval times, and
thus the use of a small listening cone to assist in opening such locks would
be irrelevant in such a game world. Then again, certain items may well be
available but not openly so. Only from shadowy, illegal sources and suppliers will
such items as lockpicks be available. Availability of many items will depend on
the nature of the society the thief operates within, as detailed in the chapter
on Guilds.
<P></P>
Since the items detailed below are not included in the <I>Player's Handbook</I>, they can be introduced to PC thieves in different ways. Going on a job with
an NPC thief who uses one or two specialty items is one way of educating a PC
thief. A second possibility is regular attendance at the informal &quot;seminars&quot; of
the Thieves' Guild—make that PC go back to high school! A third possibility is
during training; part of a thief's training by a higher-level thief may include
being told about a small number of items relevant to thief skills. If the PC
is allocating a large slice of his 30 percentage points for improving one skill
(often the case), then information about 1d3 items relevant to the use of that
skill and also 1d2 miscellaneous items can be regarded as part of what the PC
is paying for during his training. A fourth and final possibility—an
entertaining one—is that the PC hears about such items from popular stories and tales
concerning a legendary master thief NPC in the campaign world, or even from
overhearing some officers of the law discussing such matters at the next table in the
tavern!!
