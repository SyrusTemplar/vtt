Physical Requirements
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> After finding a suitable location for the altar, the priest must consider what
kind of facility he will need to house, shelter, or support the altar. In many
cases, he can simply add the altar to an existing temple, monastery, or shrine
dedicated to his deity. However, this may require the priest to expand or
renovate the existing structure to make it suitable for the altar. Refer to <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03477.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03477.htm.php.html">Table 11</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> : Building Construction Time and Cost for building costs; if the altar is to
be housed in a free-standing structure, it must be at least a medium-sized
building, but an expansion to an old temple might be the equivalent of a small
building.
<P></P>
If the altar is located on a sacred site (a forest glade for a druid power, or
a mountain peak for a god of the sky), the priest may not have to raise any
kind of building to shelter it, especially if a man-made shelter would somehow be
inappropriate at that site. However, preparing and clearing a site should
still require an amount of work equivalent to raising a small building.
