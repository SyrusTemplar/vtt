<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Characters and monsters can charge to rapidly close for combat and make an
attack. Charging is a full-move action, but a charging character may move 11/2
times his base movement when he charges. A knight with a movement of 6 can charge
an enemy up to 9 spaces away.
<P></P>
Characters begin their charge on their base initiative, moving up to one-half
the distance of the charge. In the following phase, they move the remainder of
the distance. Unlike most attack forms, the charge attack is resolved the
moment the attacker arrives. If the knight above has a base initiative of fast and
an opponent is standing 7 squares away, the knight moves 5 spaces in the fast
phase and 2 more in the average phase, at which point he attacks immediately.
<P></P>
Charging (which might more accurately be called the reckless attack) gives
characters several advantages but also imposes some penalties. The charging
character gains a +2 bonus on his attack roll. Some weapons, such as lances, are
suited for charging and inflict double damage when used in a charge.
<P></P>
Because they are so intent on the attack, however, charging characters are at
a disadvantage defensively. They lose all Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class and
suffer a +1 penalty to AC in addition to that. Guarding characters with weapons
longer than the chargerâ€™s automatically strike first. In addition, characters
can set spears (<A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02430.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02430.htm.php.html">see Guard</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">) against charges.
