<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> <B>Nonproficient:</B> Most characters have had some experience with pummeling since early
childhood, and nonproficient characters are very rare. If the optional character point
system from the <A HREF="SP_DD02863.htm#57b7e2df"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="SP_DD02863.htm#57b7e2df">Skills &amp; Powers</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> book is in use, a character who is nonproficient in pummeling may claim 3
extra character points. Such characters are very rare, however, and the DM and the
player should agree on a reason why the character is nonproficient; perhaps
the character had an isolated and nonviolent childhood, or comes from a culture
where fistfighting is unknown. A nonproficient pummeler suffers the attack
penalty listed for his class in Table 34 from the <A HREF="PHB_DD01524.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="PHB_DD01524.htm">PHB</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> and cannot score a knockdown or knockout with a pummeling attack.

<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> <B>Familiar:</B> The vast majority of characters are assumed to be familiar with pummeling,
and need not spend any character points or proficiency slots on the skill. Such
characters can make one pummeling attack each combat round with no penalty.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> <B>Proficient:</B> Any character can spend character points (or a weapon proficiency) to become
proficient at pummeling. Nonwarriors gain no benefit from pummeling
proficiency. Proficient warriors gain their full allotment of melee attacks when pummeling.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> <B>Expert:</B> Any character can spend character points (or weapon proficiencies) to become
expert at pummeling. Expert warriors who are entitled to more than one melee
attack each round can make the same number of pummeling attacks each round, but
gain no other benefits. Expert nonwarriors can make multiple pummeling attacks
at the same rate as a nonspecialized warrior of the same level.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> <B>Specialized:</B> Generally, only single-classed fighters can become pummeling specialists,
though there are optional rules in the <A HREF="SP_DD03154.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="SP_DD03154.htm">Skills &amp; Powers</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> book that allow other characters to specialize. Pummeling specialists gain
the normal specialist attack and damage bonuses and extra attacks. Specialists?
attack bonuses apply to their Strength scores when rolling for knockdowns.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> <B>Master:</B> Only single-classed warriors can attain mastery in pummeling. Pummeling
masters gain the normal master attack and damage bonuses and extra attacks. Masters?
attack bonuses apply to their Strength scores when rolling for knockdowns, and
apply as penalties to saving throws vs. knockouts. Grand master pummelers can
use critical augmentation to score knockouts on attack rolls of 16 or better.
