At the culmination of this spell, the caster hurls a pebble which grows and
increases in speed, becoming a deadly boulder that inflicts 3d6+8 points of
damage if it strikes the target. (The rules for boulders as missile weapons apply as
described in the <A HREF="DMG_DD00449.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00449.htm">DUNGEON MASTER Guide</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.) The caster's THAC0 is used to determine success, and the caster is
considered to be proficient with the thrown pebble and receives no penalty for range.
The maximum range of attack is equal to 50 feet plus 10 feet per level of the
caster. Only the caster may throw the pebble.
<P></P>
The wizard can enchant one stone at 7th level and gains one stone per three
levels of experience thereafter (two stones at 10th level, three at 13th level,
etc.). Only one pebble may be thrown per round, and pebbles must be hurled in
consecutive rounds. The spell has a duration in rounds equal to the number of
pebbles enchanted. Each pebble requires a separate attack roll. Pebbles may be
thrown at different targets within range.
<P></P>
The material components are pebbles, which revert to normal size when the
spell expires.
<P></P>
The reverse of this spell, <I>turn boulder to pebble</I>, shrinks a boulder to the size of a pebble. It affects only naturally
occurring rocks and can not be used to shrink a statue or a cut gemstone.
<P></P>
The number of rocks that may be affected is equal to the number of experience
levels of the caster. Boulders must not exceed one cubic foot per level of the
caster. Thus, a 10th-level wizard could shrink 10 rocks, each of which is equal
to or less than 10 cubic feet in size. All rocks are affected in the same
round the spell is cast. Though they need not be touched, the boulders must be
within 50 feet of the caster. Boulders that have been shrunk remain so until
dispelled.
