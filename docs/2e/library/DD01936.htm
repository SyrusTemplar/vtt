A <I>dig</I> spell enables the caster to excavate 125 cubic feet of earth, sand, or mud
per round (i.e., a cubic hole 5 feet on a side). In later rounds the caster can
expand an existing hole or start a new one. The material thrown from the
excavation scatters evenly around the pit. If the wizard continues downward past 20
feet in earth, there is a 15% chance that the pit collapses. This check is made
for every 5 feet dug beyond 20 feet. Sand tends to collapse after 10 feet, mud
fills in and collapses after 5 feet, and quicksand fills in as rapidly as it is
dug.
<P></P>
Any creature at the edge (within 1 foot) of a pit must roll a successful
Dexterity check or fall into the hole. Creatures moving rapidly toward a pit dug
immediately before them must roll a saving throw vs. spell to avoid falling in.
Any creature in a pit being excavated can climb out at a rate decided by the DM.
A creature caught in a collapsing pit must roll a saving throw vs. death to
avoid being buried; it escapes the pit if successful. Tunneling is possible with
this spell as long as there is space available for the material removed. Chances
for collapse are doubled and the safe tunneling distance is half of the safe
excavation depth, unless such construction is most carefully braced and
supported.
<P></P>
The spell is also effective against creatures of earth and rock, particularly
clay golems and those from the Elemental Plane of Earth. When cast upon such a
creature, it suffers 4d6 points of damage. A successful saving throw vs. spell
reduces this damage to half.
<P></P>
To activate the spell, the spellcaster needs a miniature shovel and tiny
bucket and must continue to hold them while each pit is excavated. These items
disappear at the conclusion of the spell.
