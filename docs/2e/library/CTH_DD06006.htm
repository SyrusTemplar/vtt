Thieves can employ stout scabbards which are slightly longer than the swords
which fit into them, leaving a length of scabbard at the end which is a
separate, hollow compartment. Usually, this can be accessed via a sliding panel at the
end of the scabbard.
<P></P>
This hollow compartment can be used to conceal a great many kinds of things,
either to smuggle them in (poisons, dog pepper, blinding powder, etc.) or
smuggle them out (gems and such). Some are so well-designed that the compartment can
be entered from above or below, so that the thief can use the false scabbard as
a snorkel (or, more correctly, as an underwater breathing tube) if he has to
stay concealed in the water for any reason.
