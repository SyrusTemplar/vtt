<FONT SIZE="3">By using this spell, the caster creates a magical ward
that has two major effects; first of all, it affects a doorway or
item that opens (a chest, for instance) as if it were a <I>hold
portal </I>spell, keeping it securely locked and closed. Secondly, if
the protected doorway is forced open by any means, magical or
physical, the sign is not only destroyed, but also strikes the
offending creature for 1d8 points of damage +1 point of damage per
level of the caster. The duration of this spell is either one day per
level of the caster or until discharged, whichever happens first. The
exact form of energy is chosen by the caster when he creates the
lesser sign; acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic disruption are
popular choices.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The sign is not hidden or concealed in any way and is
usually quite prominent on the item or portal it protects. The caster
cannot specify particular creatures or conditions for the lesser
sign&#146;s operation; it functions against any creature that
attempts to pass it (except for extraplanar creatures of 6 HD or more
and wizards of higher level than the caster&#151;they can merely
ignore it as if it were not there). The sign cannot be dispelled by
spells of lower spell levels such as knock, but the caster can remove
it any time he chooses, thus ending the spell, or it can be defeated
by an erase spell cast by a wizard of equal or higher level than the
original caster.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The material component for a <I>lesser sign </I>can be
a pinch of either powdered diamond (cold), ruby (fire), emerald
(acid), pearl (sonic disruption, or sapphire (electricity), depending
on the type of energy the wizard wishes the sign to employ. The value
of the gemstone must be at least 100 gold pieces.</FONT></P>
