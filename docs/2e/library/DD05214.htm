Single-Weapon style means that the character wields a one-handed weapon in one
hand and nothing in the other. Though in real life this type of weapon use is
often at a disadvantage compared to many of the others, it's very popular in
film and fiction . . . and so it has some virtue in the game.

The advantage of single-weapon style in the <I>AD&amp;D?</I> game is that the character keeps a hand free for grappling, for switching
weapons, for surprise maneuvers, for whatever comes along in the course of combat.
<P></P>
For instance, two fighters are going at it, and one pins the other's weapon
(see Pin, below, under &quot;Melee Maneuvers&quot;), the single-weapon fighter can use his
free hand to perform punching maneuvers; and he can try to perform barehanded
maneuvers (below, under &quot;Punching, Wrestling, and Martial Arts&quot;).

The main disadvantage to this style is that the character does not gain the
benefit of a shield's AC bonus.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
If the character devotes a weapon proficiency to Style Specialization with
Single-Weapon Style, he gets a +1 AC bonus when using any one-handed weapon (for
which he has proficiency) in Single-Weapon Style. He doesn't get the bonus if he
carries a shield or weapon in his off-hand.
<P></P>
Additionally, he can devote an <I>extra</I> proficiency to Single-Weapon Style and have a total +2 AC when fighting in
this style. That's the limit, though: He cannot devote more than two
proficiencies (for a total of +2 AC) with Single-Weapon Style.
