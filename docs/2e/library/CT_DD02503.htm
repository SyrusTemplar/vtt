</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Some characters prefer to fight with their fists and feet instead of weapons
and shields. Generally, a character can make one wrestling or overbearing attack
or two punching attacks per round. If a character is using a weapon in one
hand, he can use his second hand for an additional attack, just like fighting in
two-weapon style. However, the bare-handed attack creates an attack of
opportunity for the defender if he threatens the attacker.

All characters can punch or wrestle; it doesn’t even require a weapon
proficiency. It’s possible to specialize in unarmed combat and become better at
hand-to-hand fighting—refer to <A HREF="DD02674.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02674.htm">Chapter Five</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> for more information.
