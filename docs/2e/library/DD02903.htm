</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>y. Claustrophobia:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Aarakocra are extremely claustrophobic and are uncomfortable indoors or
underground. An aarakocra character suffers a ?3 penalty to attack rolls in such
settings.
<P></P>
<A NAME="671c398c"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>z. Size:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A number of monstrous characters enjoy the mixed blessings of being a Size
Large (L) creature. While this permits them to wield large weapons in a single
hand, or even use huge weapons with both hands, it also means that they suffer
damage as large creatures.
<P></P>
<A NAME="29b272e0"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>aa. Dehydration:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character with this restriction is vulnerable to dehydration if he spends
too much time out of the water. The character must wet his entire body (a water
skin full will do) three times per day, or lose 2 points of Constitution per
missed bath. If the character's Constitution falls to 0, he dies of dehydration.
<P></P>
<A NAME="a8696dfb"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>bb. Light:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Many humanoids are accustomed to darkness, and they find bright light to be
disorienting and painful. A character with this weakness suffers a ?1 penalty to
attacks in daylight or within the radius of <I>continual light</I> spells.
<P></P>
<A NAME="ec4313b6"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>cc. Racial enmity:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Some humanoids are the natural enemies of common demihuman races, who have
evolved special fighting techniques to combat them. Dwarves gain a +1 bonus to
attack rolls against orcs, goblins, and hobgoblins; gnomes gain a +1 bonus to
attack rolls against kobolds and goblins. In addition, ogres suffer a ?4 penalty
to hit dwarves, and ogres, bugbears, and gnolls suffer a ?4 penalty to hit
gnomes.

<A NAME="42b7ac5f"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>dd. Hideous appearance:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Mongrelmen are so warped in appearance that they have an effective Charisma
of 1 (a ?7 penalty) for purposes of Reaction Checks.
<P></P>
<A NAME="30fd89de"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>ee. Easily distracted:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Satyrs are very susceptible to distraction. Encountering a female of 15 or
higher Charisma causes the satyr to forget everything except the idea of wooing
the woman for 1?6 full turns, or even more if she is at all friendly. Even a
bitter enemy can fascinate the satyr if she makes any effort at all, and in all
circumstances satyrs have to succeed in a saving throw versus spells to
consciously harm a beautiful woman-or ignore her. A bottle of strong drink can have the
same effect.
<P></P>
<A NAME="1dfdb360"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>ff. Inhuman form:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Some monstrous characters are restricted from wearing armor or some magical
items by their body form. For example, thri-kreen and alaghi cannot wear armor;
centaurs, wemics, or bullywugs can-t wear magical boots or magical armor due to
their unusual shapes; and so on. In a questionable case, the DM should decide
if a character can use a piece of equipment or not using his best judgment of
the situation.
