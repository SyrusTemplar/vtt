This spell is similar to <I>idea</I>, except that the priest's player can ask the DM one question about any event
occurring at the moment. The question must be somehow related to evaluation of
the current situation, such as &quot;What are these monsters?&quot; Speculation about the
future, such as &quot;What's on the other side of the door?&quot; is not permitted.
<P></P>
As with <I>idea</I>, the DM must be careful in adjudicating this spell. The answer to the
question should always be relevant and correct, although not necessarily complete, and
should not be unbalancing to the situation. The answer can also be cryptic, in
the form of a riddle or rhyme, depending on the DM's assessment of the
situation. In general, the answer will be a single word or a short phrase of no more
than five words.
<P></P>
The material component is a gem of at least 50 gp value. This spell can be
cast only once in any 12-hour period. Subsequent attempts to cast the spell result
in no answer.
