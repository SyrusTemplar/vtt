<P></P>
This god is the patron of love in all its aspects: Romantic love, desire,
affection, lust, infatuation, the love between husband and wife, the love shared
between close friends, and so on.
<P></P>
Priests of the god of love are charged with promoting love whenever possible
-- especially by removing obstacles to it. When star-crossed youths wish to
marry, priests of this sect interfere to convince their families of the rightness
of it. When a marriage collapses under the weight of distrust or disinterest,
the priests try to counsel the spouses into a reconciliation. When one of the
faithful falls in love with someone who doesn't reciprocate that love, the priests
use every means at their disposal (from trickery to <I>charm </I>spells) to make the disinterested party fall in love with the more devout
character.
<P></P>
Lesser gods of this attribute will be gods of only one of the above aspects.
One god might be the god of Desire, another the god of Romance, a third the god
of Infatuations.
<P></P>
A god of all the aspects of love is likely to be female. A god of just one of
the aspects is as likely to be male as female.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Birth/Children,
Divinity of Mankind, Elemental Forces, Healing, Marriage, and Peace. The
priests of this god dislike the priests of Evil.
<P></P>

Also, unless (at DM's discretion) this god is a deity of pure and platonic
relationships, a priest of this sect may be unmarried when he enters the
priesthood (1st level) but must have been wed by the time he reaches 8th experience
level # to do otherwise is to deny the god his due, and constitutes a betrayal of
goals from the &quot;Priests and Punishment&quot; section of the &quot;Role-Playing&quot; chapter.

<B>Followers and Strongholds:</B> The followers are received at 7th level, and consist of three third-level
priests and six first-level priests of the same order, plus one third-level mage
and two first-level mages who act as consultants, one third-level fighter and
two first-level fighters who act as guards, and ten Normal Men and Women, each
with a Nonweapon Proficiency which is of use to the temple's functions
(Etiquette, Local History, and Reading/Writing especially). The priest may take the
following on adventures: Three priests (only one of whom may be third-level), one
mage, one fighter, and four Normal Men and Women of his choice. The priesthood
will pay for half of the cost of stronghold construction at 7th level. The
stronghold <I>must </I>act as a sanctuary for young lovers who come here fleeing the retribution of
angry families. For this reason, these strongholds are often built with secret
chambers and quarters for those who take sanctuary.
<P></P>
<B>Possible Symbols:</B> Girdle (the woman's belt of the ancient world, not the modern accoutrement).
<P></P>
<B>Notes:</B> The weapons chosen for this order were chosen based on the appearance of
these weapons in stories about mythological love-gods, or because of their
usefulness in capturing mates.
