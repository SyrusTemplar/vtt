<P></P>
This is the god of competition, especially of athletic competition. This god
stresses fairness, impartiality, and truth in his followers. He is also a
proponent of health, exercise, and physical self-improvement.
<P></P>
His priests follow the same goals, and support these goals by conducting
regular athletic exercises and games, and by acting as impartial judges for those
games.
<P></P>
Gods of lesser parts of the Competition attribute might be gods of specific
events; for example, to be the god of Boxing or Wrestling might be a very
honorable thing. It would be far less dramatic to be the god of the Broad Jump or the
god of Synchronized Swimming, however.
<P></P>
Gods of competition are usually male.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of the Divinity of
Mankind, Fortune/Luck, Justice/Revenge, Peace, and Strength.
<P></P>
<B>Alignment:</B> The deity is lawful good; so must be his priests. The flock, who tend to turn
to the god only in times or events of competition, may be of any alignment.
<P></P>
<B>Minimum Ability Scores:</B> Wisdom 12, Intelligence 10. Wisdom or Intelligence 16 means +5% experience;
Wisdom <I>and</I> Intelligence 16 means +10% experience.
<P></P>
<B>Races Allowed:</B> Dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, humans.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon and Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Nonweapon Proficiencies Required: Endurance. Nonweapon Proficiencies
Recommended: Reading/Writing, Religion, Gaming. Weapon Proficiencies Required: None.
Nonweapon Proficiency Group Crossovers: Priest, General, Warrior.
<P></P>
<B>Duties of the Priest:</B> Guidance, Marriage. Judgement: Priests of this god are asked to be judges at
all athletic events, to help ensure fairness in the sport. (A given event won't
necessarily have <I>only </I>priests of this god as judges, but the later rounds of events, and especially
the finals, will be judged only by these priests.) Vigilance: Against
unfairness. Priests of this god loathe unfairness and dishonesty above all other human
traits. This isn't just unfairness in the sports arena: They also oppose unjust
rule. Additionally, when two forces of basically equal honor and righteousness
clash, these priests, if they choose to become involved, tend to support the
weaker side, the underdog.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon and Armor Restrictions</B>: Weapons Permitted: Bows (all), crossbow, dagger/dirk, hand/throwing axe,
javelin, knife, lance, spear, sword (DM chooses<I> one</I> sword type from following list; choice should be the type of sword most
commonly used in organized competitions in the campaign culture: Bastard, cutlass,
khopesh, long, rapier, sabre, short, two-handed). Armor Permitted: All
non-magical armor and non-magical shields. Oriental Campaigns: Also daikyu; katana would
automatically be the sword choice. All together, these constitute Good combat
abilities.
<P></P>
<B>Other Limitations:</B> A priest of the god of competition may use magical items in normal combat and
warfare <I>but</I> he may not use them in competition matches, and he may not use them in
challenge matches with enemies unless he declares their presence to the enemy in
question. If he violates this rule, he offends his god; this is an &quot;inappropriate
weapon and armor use&quot; from the &quot;Priests and Punishment&quot; section of the
&quot;Role-Playing&quot; chapter, later in this book.
<P></P>
<B>Spheres of Influence:</B> Major Access to All, Divination, Elemental. Minor Access to Combat, Healing.
<P></P>
<B>Powers:</B> <I>Analysis, Detection, Identification</I> (as per the Designing Faiths chapter) of cheating in athletic competition and
challenge fights. If the competition is set up with rules in advance, the
priest of this sect, if he is watching the fight or competition from within 60',
will always be able to detect when the rules are broken, and be able to tell
whether it was deliberate or accidental; they are also 100% accurate when telling
whether someone stepped out of a boundary, telling who reached the finish line
first, etc. (This power is the principal reason that these priests are always
asked to judge events.) <I>Bless</I>: The priest can cast this spell three times per day in addition to all other
spells he can cast. At eighth level, he can cast it six times per day in
addition to all other spells he can cast.
<P></P>
<B>Followers and Strongholds:</B> The followers are received at 8th level, and consist of one fifth-level
priest, three third-level priests, and sixteen first-level priests, of the same
order. The priest may take the following on adventures: Three priests of his
choice. The priesthood will pay for half of the cost of stronghold construction at
8th level. The stronghold must include athletic fields, and youthful athletes
from the local communities must be admitted regularly so that they might use those
fields.
<P></P>
<B>Possible Symbols:</B> Laurel wreath.
