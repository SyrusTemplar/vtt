<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">To set a grappling hook, the wielder makes an attack roll vs. Armor Class 5,
adjusted for range. It takes a full round to hurl the hook and set it firmly or
to recover the grapple after a miss.
<P></P>
A character climbing by means of a rope and grapple moves at the rope and wall
rate and receives a bonus to his climbing chance (see <A HREF="PHB_DD01783.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01783.htm">PHB</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, Chapter 14).
<P></P>
A defender can cut the rope attached to a grapple by attacking it with a
slashing weapon. The rope has an Armor Class of 5 and 5 hit points. A length of
light chain can be attached to the grapple to make cutting more difficult. A chain
reduces the grapple-s maximum range in half. The chain has an Armor Class of 0
and 20 hit points.
