In the last chapter, you were confronted with over sixty different priest
character classes to choose from. Certainly, that range of choices will make it
easy for your to individualize your priest character -- to make him different from
the rest of the campaign's clerics.
<P></P>
In this chapter, we'll make that even easier.
<P></P>
You can further customize your priest by taking a <I>priest kit</I> for him. A <I>kit </I>is a collection of skills, proficiencies, restrictions, benefits and
hindrances which give the priest more background and personality, further define his
role in the campaign and in the campaign's cultures, and give him advantages and
disadvantages to make him more colorful.
