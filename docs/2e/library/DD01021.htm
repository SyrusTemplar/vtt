<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Phylactery of Monstrous Attention:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">While this arm wrapping appears to be a beneficial device, it actually draws
the attention of supernatural creatures of exactly the opposite alignment of the
priest wearing it. This results in the priest being plagued by powerful and
hostile creatures whenever he is in an area where such creatures are or can
appear. If the priest is of 10th or higher level, the attention of his deity's most
powerful enemy will be drawn, causing this being to interfere directly. Once
donned, a <I>phylactery of monstrous attention</I> cannot be removed without a <I>wish</I> spell and then a quest must be performed to re-establish the priest in his
alignment.
