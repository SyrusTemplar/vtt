No priest character <I>has </I>to take any priest-kit. It's not necessary, it's not required: It's just a way
of adding detail to the character.
<P></P>
A priest character may only take one priest-kit. He should take it when he is
first created. In campaigns which began before you got <I>The Complete Priest Handbook</I>, the DM should allow characters to take priest-kits, but only ones which are
appropriate to the characters' actions and deeds so far. (For example, if a
character has been a perfectly ordinary priest until now, he should not take the
Outlaw Priest kit; it's not appropriate.)
<P></P>
Once a character has taken a Priest Kit, he cannot change it to another Priest
Kit. He can, however, eventually<I> abandon</I> it (see &quot;<A HREF="DD05610.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD05610.htm">Abandoning Kits</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot; later in this chapter); having abandoned a kit, he will not be able to take
another one.
<P></P>
If you want to inject the choice of the Priest Kit into the character creation
process, you'll first want to determine your character's Ability Scores ( <I>Player's Handbook</I> <A HREF="PHB_DD01421.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01421.htm">Chapter 1</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">), Race (<A HREF="PHB_DD01438.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01438.htm">Chapter 2</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">), Class (<A HREF="PHB_DD01480.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01480.htm">Cleric</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> or <A HREF="PHB_DD01489.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01489.htm">Druid</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> from Chapter 3 of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>, or one of the priest classes from the previous chapter of this book), and

<P></P>
It's at this point that you choose your priest kit.
<P></P>
After that's done, and the information recorded on your character sheet, you
can proceed to Proficiencies (Chapter 5), Money and Equipment (Chapter 6), etc.
