   <B>Description:</B> Skilled in diplomacy as well as combat, an Envoy serves as an official
representative of his government in other countries. Though he uses force when
necessary to achieve his goals, he prefers compromise to hostility. He seeks friendly
alliances with good-aligned governments, common ground with neutral societies,
and a quick and efficient end to evil cultures.
<P></P>
   <B>Requirements: </B>An Envoy must have a minimum Intelligence score of 12.
<P></P>
<B>   Ministration:</B> Government.
<P></P>
<B>   Role:</B> An envoy's duties range from the routine to the life-threatening. One month,
he may be asked to deliver a banquet invitation to a friendly monarch. The
next, he may be required to open hostage negotiations with a tribe of cannibals. He
represents his country in treaty discussions, files reports about foreign
military activities, and ventures into unexplored territories to scout for new
trade routes. Although an Envoy rarely has the authority to make decisions on his
own, his superiors take his recommendations seriously.
<P></P>
   The Envoy prides himself on his sensible, practical approach to problems. He
is thoughtful, analytical, and appeasing, the logical choice for negotiator in
an adventuring party. He is the voice of reason, hesitant to engage in
drawn-out, bloody wars before exploring less extreme options. Rather than engaging an
evil regime on the battlefield, an Envoy prefers to work behind the scenes,
perhaps engineering a political revolution or quietly dispatching the tyrannical
leaders.
<P></P>
<B>   Symbol:</B> Owl, raven, scales of justice, scepter.
<P></P>
<B>   Secondary Skills:</B> Groom, Limner/Painter, Scribe, Trader/Barterer.
<P></P>
<B>   Weapon Proficiencies:</B> An Envoy spends less time practicing weapons than he does learning other
skills. He may have only <I>two</I> weapon proficiencies in his entire career. He acquires his proficiencies at
1st level, choosing any weapons he likes.
<P></P>
   <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonus:</I> Etiquette. <I>Required:</I> Bureaucracy*. <I>Recommended:</I> Artistic Ability, Dancing, Gaming, Heraldry, Law*, Local History, Oratory*,
Reading/Writing.
<P></P>
   <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Standard. Because an Envoy comes in regular contact with dignitaries and
officials, it's important that he make a good impression. He must purchase all of
the formal attire listed in the Clothing and Special Items section of Chapter 6
as soon as he can afford them.
<P></P>
<B>   Bonded Mount:</B> Any.
<P></P>
<B>   Special Benefits:</B>
<P></P>
<I>   Reaction Bonus:</I> A master of persuasion, an Envoy receives a +2 modifier on reaction rolls
from all NPCs, including those of evil alignment.
<P></P>
   <I>Diplomatic Privileges:</I> An Envoy enjoys all of the following privileges in any country with which his
government has established diplomatic relations:
<P></P>
• The host country must provide food and shelter for the Envoy as long as
necessary for him to complete official business. The host country is <I>not</I> required to extend this privilege to any of the Envoy's companions other than
his immediate family, though many host countries will do so as a matter of
courtesy. If the Envoy is merely passing through the host country and has no official business there, the host country is not obliged to provide
food and shelter; but again, many will do so out of courtesy.
<P></P>
• The host country must guarantee the Envoy's safety in time of war, or
provide a military escort to return the paladin to his homeland.
<P></P>
• The Envoy is usually immune to arrest and prosecution. However, should the
paladin commit a crime, he may be asked to leave the host country. In extreme
situations, the host country may sever diplomatic ties with the Envoy's homeland,
likely resulting in dire consequences for the Envoy when he reports to his
unhappy superiors.
<P></P>
• The Envoy may not be taxed by the host country, regardless of how long he
stays.
<P></P>
• The Envoy has complete freedom to practice his religion.
<P></P>
• Officials of the host country may not demand to see the Envoy's private
correspondence with his homeland.
<P></P>
  <B>Special Hindrances:</B>
<P></P>
   A Envoy's position and responsibilities often puts his life at risk. He makes
a tempting target for assassins and kidnappers from rival governments, and a
likely hostage in times of war. Even the most innocuous insult or slightest
breach of protocol may be considered a grievous offense, punishable by both the
affronted government and the Envoy's own superiors. As a gesture of good faith, an
Envoy may be required to enter a hostile village alone and unarmed. Rather than
eliminate an evil NPC, an Envoy may be asked to arrest him unharmed, then
return him to the proper authorities for prosecution.
