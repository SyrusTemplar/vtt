One last note about levels of priests within the faith: There are many
non-priest characters who belong to the administrative organization of any faith in a
campaign world.
<P></P>
Most are Normal Men and Women who work in individual temples, as servants,
messengers, grooms, and sometimes as teachers, scribes, and consultants.
<P></P>
Many are warriors hired to protect temples in dangerous areas, to act as
bodyguards for travelling priests, and to train priests in the finer points of
combat.
<P></P>
Some are mages, bards, and even thieves hired as consultants and specialists.
