Where is the character from? This will have an effect on what sorts of skills
the thief may have picked up. City, countryside, and wilderness are all
possible settings; or the thief may have been a wanderer all of his life.
<P></P>
<B>City: </B>Any place where people gather in large numbers, there will be those who live
off the sweat and toil of others. Besides politicians, thieves are often among
this group. A city background will open many possibilities of specialization for
your thief. Because a city is a complicated web of many people, each person
tends to have more specialized functions. This is true for thieves as well as
normal, respectable citizens.
<P></P>
Note that thieves in cities, especially those who have very specialized skills
and abilities, are most likely connected with a thieves' guild; or, if they
are not, they will surely run afoul of one sooner or later. If your thief hails
from an urban center, be sure to figure out what his relationship to the local
thieves' guild (or, in some places, guilds) is.
<P></P>
<B>Countryside:</B> A few thieves are able to make a living in a single populated, rural area.
They tend to be quite different from their city-dwelling cousinsâ€”pickpocketing,
for instance, is probably not going to be practiced much without the shelter and
anonymity of the urban crowds. Extortion, banditry, burglary, and various
similar thefts are more typical means of making a living from the peasants and
their rulers in the countryside. Fences also may work the countryside, selling
wares that may have been stolen in distant cities.
<P></P>
Thieves' guilds often have an active hand in populated rural regions, though
it is not as firm as in the cities.
<P></P>
<B>Wilderness:</B> Thieves are, by definition, those who garner their living from others, so few
are to be found making their permanent abode in the wilderness, far from human
settlement. Those who do are usually bandits, with a stronghold set up
somewhere secure, from which they can make raids on nearby settlements or trade
routes. In AD&amp;D fantasy settings, there are also innumerable possibilities for
thieves who survive by taking liberties in their relationships with the local
non-humans.
<P></P>
While few thieves' guilds would claim any wilderness as &quot;territory,&quot; thieves
from these regions are typically affiliated with one or another organized band
of miscreants. These bandit groups don't have the organization or sophistication
of the urban guilds, but they are still formidable, and their rivalries may
run as deep as any among the big city guilds.
<P></P>
A great many demihuman thieves originally hail from a wilderness setting,
although they do not necessarily fit the &quot;bandit&quot; mold common among humans. (See

<P></P>
<B>Wandering:</B> Finally, some thieves have never called any place &quot;home.&quot; They travel town
and village, city and wilderness, wherever they think fortune might grant them
better opportunities. Charlatans, those who make their living by duping others
with all sorts of fraud, are often wanderers: They will stay in one place as long
as there's money to be made, but they hope to be long gone, preying on others'
gullibility, before their scams are uncovered.
