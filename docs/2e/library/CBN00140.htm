This spell summons one or more undead into the general vicinity of the priest.
The creatures answer the summons within 7–12 rounds (1d6+6). Upon their
arrival, lesser undead will usually seek to eliminate the priest at once unless he
(or she) is suitably fortified behind <I>protection from evil 10’ radius</I>. More powerful, intelligent undead may attempt to parley with the priest, but
they will invariably end the conversation and attack once their initial
curiosity has been satisfied. A priest must be prepared to command, cajole, entice,
or destroy whatever creature has been called into his service.
<P></P>
Whenever possible, the DM should choose what kind of undead answers the
priest’s summoning, based on the caster’s current surroundings, level of ability, and
alignment. Alternatively, the DM may roll a d20 and consult the following
table:

Special undead might include sons of Kyuss, apparitions, crypt things, eyes of
fear and flame, and any other unusual undead creature the DM may wish to
introduce. In truly rare circumstances (for instance, if the spell is cast near a
creature’s lair), this spell might attract the attention of a more powerful
undead, such as a death knight, vampire, or even a lich. These beings will seldom
arrive in a predictable fashion and are the most likely to demand some form of
nasty retribution or lavish sacrifice to appease.
<P></P>
The summoned undead remain in the vicinity of the priest for at least one turn
per level and may be commanded to assist the priest in his or her endeavors
(including, possibly, attacking the caster’s opponents). Unless fortified with <I>resist turning</I>, the undead summoned by this spell can be turned (or commanded) by priests
other than the caster. Because it enlists the service of powerful and malicious
undead, summon undead is granted only to priests serving evil deities.
