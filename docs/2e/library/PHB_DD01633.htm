<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The equipment list reflects the price of a suit of armor (including an
appropriate helmet) made for any normal player character race. Although a halfling is
much smaller than a human and needs a smaller suit, there are fewer armorers
available to meet such specialized needs. Thus, the armor for a halfling is as
expensive as that for a human. Armor for nonstandard sizes and shapes is going to
cost significantly more and must be custom-made. This is not the kind of thing
one can pick up at the local store!
<P></P>
When armor is found during the course of an adventure, the players should note
the creature who wore the armor previously. While a human-sized character
might be able to wear the armor of a gnoll, it will do little good for a halfling.
Likewise, the armor of a giant is of little use to anyone.
<P></P>
Armor size also affects the weight of the armor, if the optional encumbrance
system is used. The weights listed on the table are for human-sized (Medium)
armors. Small armor weighs half the amount listed, while large armor weighs 50%
more.
