<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Astrology:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This proficiency gives the character some understanding of the supposed
influences of the stars. Knowing the birth date and time of any person, the
astrologer can study the stars and celestial events and then prepare a forecast of the
future for that person. The astrologer's insight into the future is limited to
the next 30 days, and his knowledge is vague at best. If a successful
proficiency check is made, the astrologer can foresee some general event--a great battle,
a friend lost, a new friendship made, etc. The DM decides the exact prediction
(based on his intentions for the next few gaming sessions). Note that the
prediction does not guarantee the result--it only indicates the potential result.
If the proficiency check is failed, no information is gained unless a 20 is
rolled, in which case the prediction is wildly inaccurate.
<P></P>
Clearly this proficiency requires preparation and advance knowledge on the
part of the DM. Because of this, it is permissible for the DM to avoid the
question, although this shouldn't be done all the time. Players who want to make their
DM's life easier (always a good idea) should consider using this proficiency
at the end of a gaming session, giving the DM until the next session to come up
with an answer. The DM can use this proficiency as a catalyst and guide for his
adventures--something that will prompt the player characters to go to certain
places or to try new things.
<P></P>
Characters with the astrology proficiency gain a +1 bonus to all navigation
proficiency checks, provided the stars can be seen.
