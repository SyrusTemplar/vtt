<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Appearance:</B> Pizentios’s most distinguishing feature is his clammy blue-gray skin. His
fingernails and lips are an even darker shade of blue, lending him the appearance
of a fresh corpse. When he smiles, his blue-black gums contrast hideously with
his pearl white teeth. Pizentios is otherwise a dumpy, short, middle-aged man
with a protruding round belly. Most of his hair has fallen out, leaving him
partially bald, except for a thin fuzzy band of whitish strands clustered above his
ears and around the back of his head. He has intense, dark eyes and a cold,
emotionless voice that sends shivers up the spines of weak-hearted listeners.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Background:</B> Pizentios was hand-picked as an apprentice by the infamous necromancer Nebt
Bhakau. When Pizentios was a youth, Bhakau sent him to explore Sahu and learn
the secrets of the Necromancer Kings. Before Pizentios could return, however, he
learned of his master’s imprisonment and demise. Fearing a similar fate should
he return, Pizentios remained on Sahu.
<P></P>
One day, Pizentios encountered a group of ghouls and joined their pack by
using ghast salve. The ghouls led him to the Garden of Eternity, where he met the
imprisoned Vermissa (see her NPC sheet). The lich had once been Bhakau’s patron,
and she embraced Pizentios as an exiled son. The necromancer swore an oath of
fealty to Vermissa and her evil god, Thasmudyan, gaining the ability to
perceive hidden auras (enhanced vision) and command undead. Pizentios also gained the
service of an infernal familiar, Ifrit.
<P></P>
Ifrit is an unusual imp. Although he can take any of the normal forms, his
preferred shape is that of a man-sized shadow, with tiny horns and vestigial
wings. In this form, he is 90% undetectable in shadowy surroundings and completely
invisible in deep shadows (or darkness). Unlike an undead shadow, however, Ifrit
is not harmed or deterred by light. The fiend delights in terrorizing
Pizentios’ apprentices, and requires one blood sacrifice per week to assure his
loyalty. If so appeased, the imp follows his master’s orders obediently.
<P></P>
Pizentios was too young and inexperienced to contain the new powers bestowed
on him. The initiation nearly killed him, leaving him hideously disfigured.
Pizentios recovered and founded a small school for necromancers outside the
entrance of Vermissa’s Garden. He is currently training new skilled followers for her
cult. These apprentices naturally have no idea of what transpires in
Pizentios’s “secret garden.”
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Role-Playing Notes:</B> Pizentios is smug and arrogant, confident in the knowledge that he is
Vermissa’s favorite pet. His power has grown considerably in the past few years, and
he yearns to learn all of his former master’s great secrets. In many ways, he is
like a spoiled child who has been given too much, too soon. No matter how much
he learns or gains, he always wants more. This insatiable ambition, combined
with his genius intellect, makes Pizentios a deadly opponent.
<P></P>
In battle, he will first surround himself in a <I>wall of bones</I>, and then <I>summon shadows</I> to distract his enemy. He will next prepare <I>minor globe of invulnerability</I> and <I>spirit armor</I> as quickly as possible. Depending upon the wind conditions, he will hit his
foes with <I>cloudkill</I> or <I>Beltyn’s burning blood</I> (his favorites). Should he be pressed into melee, he can fight with either
his <I>shadowblade </I>or his enchanted staff. Finally, if an encounter goes poorly, he will call in
Ifrit for a distraction and either <I>dimension door</I> himself away or polymorph into a gargoyle to escape.
