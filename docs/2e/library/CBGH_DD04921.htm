The halfling Sheriff is really more of a benign constable than a tough
enforcer, but he or she does represent the long arm of the law (so to speak) among the
villagers and visitors in his or her community. The position is, for the most
part, an honorary one--since halflings don't have a lot of troublemakers among
their own ranks and don't run the kind of establishments that tend to draw
humans ruffians. Still, the post represents the faith and confidence of a good
number of villagers, and the responsibility tends to be taken very seriously by the
halfling who holds it.
<P></P>
A halfling Sheriff must have a Charisma of at least 13 (most have Charismas
which are much higher) and a Strength of at least 11.
<P></P>
Roads to Adventure: The solving of a complex crime can serve admirably to draw
a halfling Sheriff into an adventure. Though his or her primary duty always
lies with the halflings of his or her village or shire, the Sheriff is willing to
range far and wide in pursuit of those who have wronged those neighbors. In
keeping with halfling values, however, this dogged pursuit extends only to those
who have caused bodily harm--the Sheriff is not likely to make a vigorous
pursuit merely to recover lost property. Thus a Sheriff may turn a blind eye on the
doings of Bandits and Smugglers in the area, but ruffians who beat up an
elderly farmer will soon find the same Sheriff leading an angry posse in hot pursuit.
<P></P>
Role: Within the village, the halfling Sheriff has a small office--often a
corner of his or her own burrow--where he or she can usually be found when not out
&quot;keeping an eye on things.&quot; Jails are not common in halfling villages, but if
there is a lockup it will be nearby. It will, however, have its own separate
entrance, secured by a stout door and lock.
<P></P>
Most of the Sheriff's time is spent in seeing that all goes as it should and
in looking out for signs of trouble (&quot;Odd that Old Mistress Elderberry didn't
come to market this morning; she hardly ever misses a day&quot;). Although he or she
doesn't maintain a regular 'beat,' the Sheriff does spend a lot of time ambling
through the village and will try to find an excuse to visit outlying farms and
isolated families at least once a week to see that all is well with their
inhabitants.
<P></P>
Often he or she is politely nosy, asking questions about things that have
changed, displaying interest in everything going on in the community or canton. A
Sheriff knows all the local citizens by name and is familiar enough with their
normal habits to take note of any break in routine--such as the baker not firing
up her oven in the morning, or the farmer leaving his irrigation gate closed.
In these instances, the Sheriff would make a friendly check to make sure
nothing is amiss.
<P></P>
Among halflings there are not a lot of laws that require the attention of law
enforcement. Thievery is one, and so is violent assault and of course murder.
None of these crimes are likely to be committed by one villager against
another--in the rare case where this occurs and can be proven, a thief is forced to
make restitution, while a halfling guilty of deliberately harming another is
banished from the community for life (many of these become Mercenaries; see the
preceding kit). More common are boundary disputes, complaints from halfling fathers
about overzealous suitors who pursue their daughters, or charges of unfair
trading. The Sheriff usually resolves all of these with calm diplomacy, and it is
not uncommon for even the loser to come away from a settlement feeling that he
or she has received very fair treatment.
<P></P>
The Sheriff also typically has the authority to call up the Small Folk in
times of crisis, crying for a muster of all who can bear arms. The post does <I>not </I>necessarily entitle him or her to command of the company when it assembles;
such leadership is more often a matter of past experience and age.
<P></P>
Being Sheriff of a halfling village, especially if it's a smaller community,
is not necessarily a full time job, so it is quite likely that this character
will run a small farm or practice some sort of trade as well. Running a small
store is a common practice among Sheriffs, since it allows them to remain at their
post most of the time and also provides interaction with the village citizenry.
<P></P>
Secondary Skills: Any.
<P></P>
Weapon Proficiencies: The Sheriff should be proficient in the use of the short
sword, the club, and the knife.
<P></P>
Bonus Nonweapon Proficiencies: None.
<P></P>
Recommended Nonweapon Proficiencies: Tracking skill and knowledge of an extra
language or two are proficiencies that can make a Sheriff's job a lot easier.
<P></P>
Equipment: A Sheriff's arms and armor usually come with the job, so the
character doesn't have to purchase these. It is not unlikely that he or she will also
have access to a pony, should the need for a mount arise.
<P></P>
Special Benefits: The authority of respectable halfling society is the primary
benefit of the Sheriff. He or she receives a +2 bonus on all NPC Reaction
Rolls made for halfling NPCs (as long as the other character knows of the Sheriff's
rank).
<P></P>
Special Hindrances: All Sheriffs have a strong sense of duty and will respond
at once when called upon--i.e., whenever anyone in the village has a need for
his or her services. This can often entail long hours and rude interruptions in
the Sheriff's enjoyment of life.
