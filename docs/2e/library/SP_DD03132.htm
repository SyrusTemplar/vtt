<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Phobia?Heights:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This character has difficulty climbing ladders and ropes, perching on walls,
and negotiating steep, cliff-side trails. He will be eager to look for another
way around if such a climb is called for, but if he makes a successful
Wisdom/Willpower check he can overcome his fear. If the check fails, however, the
character will do everything possible to avoid the climb. Another check is allowed
2?12 turns later.
