<P></P>
The <I>Player's Option </I>combat system resolves actions in five action phases: <I>very fast, fast, average, slow, </I>and <I>very slow</I>. A character's action phase is determined by his <I>base initiative</I>, modified by his weapon speed and the combat action he selects for the round.
Striking at an opponent standing next to you doesn-t take much time at all,
but running halfway across the battlefield in a long charge will take a little
more time.
<P></P>
At the beginning of each round of combat, both sides roll a d10. The side with
the lowest roll wins initiative. In each action phase, the side that has won
initiative attacks and moves first. In any given action phase for one side of a
fight, attacks and spells occur before movement takes place. (In other words,
if you and your companion both take an action in the average phase, your buddy
gets to fire an arrow or cast a spell down that hallway before you actually
begin running down it.) If there are fast creatures on both sides of the fight, the
fast creature that won initiative strikes before the fast creature that lost
initiative. Fast creatures strike before average creatures, even if the average
creature's side won initiative.

Some initiative rolls provide unusual results:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> A roll of 1 accelerates the action phase of that side by one, so a slow
character gets to go in the average phase;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> A roll of 10 slows the action phase of that side by one step;
<P></P>

or the other wins, and then consult the <A HREF="DD02413.htm#bd5db439"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02413.htm#bd5db439">Critical Event Table</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> below.
