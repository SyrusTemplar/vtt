<FONT SIZE="3">It has been a long time getting here. I don't mean the
months, perhaps even years, you may have waited for a revised,
expanded, and improved edition of the AD&amp;D game. I mean the long
time it has taken me to reach this point, the writing of the
foreword. Forewords are written last, so that you can summarize your
feelings and experiences about the book you have written.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">It's not accurate to say this is a book that I alone
have written. First off, there are a lot of other names listed in the
credits. They, especially the editors, contributed time and talents
that I don't have. Improving the organization and readability was one
of the reasons we started this project in the first place. These are
tasks that can't be done without talented editors who play and care
about the game. If you discover that it's easier to find rules during
your gaming sessions and that everything seems to make more sense,
thank the editors.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Even with the editors, this is not our work alone.
None of this would ever have come into being without interested and
involved players. The people who really decided what needed to be
done for the AD&amp;D 2nd Edition game are the players who mailed in
questions, everyone who wrote an article for DRAGON&reg; Magazine,
and everyone who button-holed me (or other designers) at conventions.
These were the people who decided what needed to be done, what needed
fixing, what was unclear, and what they just didn't like. I didn't
sit in a vacuum and make these decisions. As the designer and
developer, I had to make the final choice, but those choices were
based on your input. And your input is the most valuable asset we
have going.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">So how do I feel? Excited, exhausted, relieved, and
nervous -- all at once. It's a great bag of emotions. I'm excited to
see this book come out. I've spent more time on this than I have on
any other single work I've done. That leads to exhaustion. The
AD&amp;D 2nd Edition game has demanded and received hours upon months
of attention. Now that it is finally coming out, the feeling of
relief is beginning to set in. There were times when the task looked
impossible, when it seemed it would never end, or when everything was
going wrong. Only now, when it's in the final stages of polishing, am
I beginning to realize that it is really done. And of course there is
the nervousness. The AD&amp;D game is the granddaddy of all
role-playing games. You've made it perfectly clear that you liked the
original edition of the AD&amp;D game, even with all its warts. I
liked (and still like) it. So, now with the arrival of AD&amp;D 2nd
Edition, of course I'm nervous.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">None of this comes as any surprise. I volunteered to
prepare this Edition because I wanted to do something for the game I
liked. The ten years of experience I've had in game design has shown
me what works and what doesn't and sometimes even why. At the very
start, we outlined the goals: to make it easier to find things, to
make the rules easier to understand, to fix the things that did not
work, to add the best new ideas from the expansions and other
sources, and, most important of all, to make sure the game was still
the one you knew and enjoyed. Of them all, the last was the hardest
and most demanding, conflicting as it did with my basic desire to
design things. Fortunately, things didn't rest on me alone. Lots of
eager eyes, from those of fellow designers to those of enthusiastic
playtesters, minutely examined this book and restrained me from
overzealousness. It hasn't always been easy to walk the fine line
between &quot;not enough&quot; and &quot;too much.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">In the past two years, I've talked to interested
players many times, hearing their concerns and sharing my ideas. It
was at the end of one of these talks (at a convention in Missoula,
Montana), just as I described some rules change, that one of the
listeners smiled and said, &#147;You know, we've been doing that for
years.&#148; And that is what AD&amp;D 2nd Edition is all
about--collecting and organizing all those things that we, as
players, have been doing for years.</FONT></P>
