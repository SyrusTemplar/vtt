Halflings are briefly described in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS® 2nd
Edition <I>Player's Handbook</I>. The three most common subraces (Hairfoot, Tallfellow, and Stout) are
detailed in the <I>Monstrous Compendium</I>, Volume One, while the feral halflings of Athas are described in the DARK
SUN® Rule Book as well as in the DARK SUN MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM appendix (MC12).
Finally, players of campaigns set in the DRAGONLANCE® world of Krynn will find
that the ubiquitous Kender has finally been ranked (for better or worse) among
the official halfling subraces.
