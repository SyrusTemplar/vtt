It’s possible to use your weapon or shield to pin your enemy’s weapon against
his body or to trap the weapon on your own sword-hilt or weapon haft. This
maneuver is known as a trap. Traps are much like blocks; the character can get a
chance to trap an attack that comes before his action phase by declaring the trap
before initiative is rolled, or he can trap any attack that comes in his
action phase or later without declaring his action beforehand.

Like with a disarm, the trap is resolved before the normal attack roll is
made. A character attempts to trap an enemy’s attack by rolling an opposed attack
roll versus AC 0 while his opponent rolls against AC 4. If the trapping
character wins the opposed roll, the weapon is successfully pinned. Otherwise, the pin
fails and the normal attack roll is made.

Once an enemy’s weapon is trapped, he loses any additional attacks he could
have made with that weapon in the current round. At the end of the round, the
trapping character and his victim make opposed Strength rolls to see if the victim
can free his weapon. In each subsequent round, one Strength check is made on
the fastest character’s base initiative, and a second one at the end of the
round.

A character with a trapped weapon can always attack with a secondary weapon or
simply abandon the weapon that’s been caught. The character who performs the
trap cannot use the weapon or shield he’s pinning the opponent’s weapon with.

Trapping is an excellent tactic to use against an opponent with fewer attacks.
It is also a good tactic for a two-weapon fighter to use against a
single-weapon fighter; by sacrificing one weapon’s attacks, he completely stops his
opponent’s offense. Another sneaky trick is to have an ally trap a tough opponent’s
weapon to free up unanswered flank or rear attacks for a second character.
Trapping is tougher than a simple block, but worth the effort.
