A character with boating proficiency is needed to guide a boat down a rapid
stream or to reduce the dangers of capsizing a canoe or kayak. In addition, a
character with boating proficiency can insure that a boat is propelled at its
maximum speed.
<P></P>
Note that this proficiency is distinct from Navigation and Seamanship, which
apply to ships on oceans, seas, or at least large lakes, rather than small craft
on smaller lakes and rivers.
