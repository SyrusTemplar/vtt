When two opposing creatures move adjacent to each other, it's time to switch
the scale from missile to melee scale. Select one figure as an anchor, and move
all the other figures three times as far from the anchor as they were. In
effect, you-re zooming in on the battle.
<P></P>
An easier but less accurate method of zooming in on the battle is to simply
announce that you-re switching scale and allow both players and monsters to get a
second set-up. As long as everyone sticks by the spirit of the set-up, just
eyeball it. Make certain that the opposing forces have three times as many
squares between them as they did before the scale was zoomed in.
