<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Keen Eyesight:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> These characters have “eagle eyes.” That is, they can perceive details at
about twice the range of characters with normal vision. Keen eyesight does not
improve a character’s ability to see in the dark, nor does it convey unique
peripheral vision. However, if a group of companions make out a party in the
distance, the keen-eyed character might be able to tell the whether the party consists
of humans or goblins. When the others can discern the race of the distant
party, this character can tell how they’re armed and how they’re dressed.
<P></P>
A character with the keen eyesight trait receives a +1 bonus on all rolls to
hit with a missile weapon at long range.
<P></P>
Elves can purchase this trait for 1 less character point than the listed
amount.
