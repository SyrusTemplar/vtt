<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Pirate</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Like mariners, pirates love the ocean. However, pirates also love wealth.
Evil pirates are the scum of the seas. They’ll attack a ship and kill the crew to
a man—unless there is a nobleman or wealthy heiress on board they can hold for
ransom. These buccaneers have no lofty goals and fight for no cause other than
to net the next ship full of booty.

Privateers are neutral- or good-aligned pirates who are usually commissioned
by a government to prey on the shipping of that government’s enemy. Privateers
are often granted Letters of Marque that state they are in the employ of their
king or queen. As representatives of a nation, privateers are expected to behave
with a code of honor. They accept surrenders, treat prisoners well, and are
always deferential to any noble captives—especially those of the opposite sex.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Requirements:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> A life on the sea is rigorous and demanding. Pirates must have minimum
Constitution/Health and Dexterity/Balance scores of 12. The pirate kit is prohibited
for dwarves, aarakocra, alaghi, bullywugs, centaurs, ogres, orcs, satyrs,
swanmays, thri-kreen, and wemics. This kit is open to all classes.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Pirates can be versed in any weapons applicable to their classes. However,
rapiers and cutlasses are suggested for swashbuckling characters.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended nonweapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Navigation, fishing, seamanship, rope use, gambling, tightrope walking,
direction sense, swimming, weather sense.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Equipment:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Pirates tend to avoid large weapons and heavy armor. Characters who are
weighted down have a hard time climbing around in the ship’s rigging and are likely
to drown if they are pitched overboard during a storm or a fierce battle.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended traits:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Alertness, glibness, light sleeper.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Benefits:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Pirates are accustomed to the pitch and roll of a ship and have an advantage
when engaged in melee on deck. They gain a +1 bonus to their attack rolls while
fighting at sea. Pirates also have a designated hideaway. Such locations
include deserted isles, hidden anchorages, a sea-cave complex beneath the port city,
etc.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hindrances:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Pirates suffer a –2 penalty on reaction rolls when they enter a port. If a
pirate behaves in a manner appropriate to the setting, this penalty may be
reduced and then eliminated upon subsequent visits. Pirates often make a lot of
enemies. Hence, pirates are sometimes hunted by those they plundered. Pirate
characters should never get too complacent—there’s always somebody not too far away
who wants the character’s loot or head to show that this sea wolf will prowl the
oceans no more.
