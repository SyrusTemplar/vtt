<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Warp Marble:</B> This item is a small ( Â½ -inch diameter) sphere of fine crystal, often
appearing with a rich blue or aquamarine hue. Each marble has three words of command
associated with it.
<P></P>
The first command triggers the marble to create an extradimensional space
large enough to contain a single large-sized creature. When this word is spoken,
the closest creature to the marble is instantly transported to and imprisoned
within this space. Similar to the seclusion spell, the inhabitant of this space
can see and hear events in the &quot;real world,&quot; but can do nothing to affect
anything outside the prison. Spellcasting and use of psionics are impossible while
within the prison. If the prison is already occupied, this first word of command
will have no effect.
<P></P>
The second command word releases the occupant of the extradimensional space.
The occupant is immediately returned to the &quot;real world,&quot; appearing within three
feet of the marble (wherever it might be). Note that this word of release can
be spoken and will be effective from within the prison. Thus, the possessor of
the marble can use it as a sanctuary to escape from harm.
<P></P>
The third word of command sets the marble as a trap. After this word is
spoken, the first creature of large size or smaller to touch the marble is
immediately imprisoned within the extradimensional space. If the first creature to touch
the marble is larger than size L, the magic is not triggered; if a size L or
smaller creature subsequently touches the item, the magic takes effect.
<P></P>
Once one creature has been imprisoned, other creatures can touch the marble
with no adverse effects. A creature trapped in this method can be freed only
through the use of the word of release from outside the marble.
<P></P>
A marble trapped in this manner can be thrown at another creature in an
attempt to trap the creature. If an attack roll is successful, the target creature is
allowed a saving throw versus spell. Success indicates that the creature
suffers no effect. Failure indicates that the creature is trapped in the <I>warp marble</I>.
<P></P>
If a marble is taken into an extradimensional space (such as within a <I>portable hole</I>), if it is <I>teleported, gated</I>, or <I>transported</I> via dimensional folding or any analogous method, or if it is shifted to
another plane of existence, any occupant of the extradimensional space is
immediately expelled into the Astral plane.
<P></P>
