This section contains additional information about creating various types of
items, including required spells and the chance to create the item.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Potions
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A potion requires no spells, but the caster must first have the formula.
Determining a formula from scratch requires 1d3+1 weeks and costs 100 gp a week.
Time and costs are reduced to the minimum if the caster has access to <I>commune</I> or <I>contact other plane</I> spells. If the caster has a potion to analyze or a formula from another
caster, the research is free and requires one week. A character must have a full
dose of the potion to analyze, but the dose is not consumed in the research. The
time requirement listed on <A HREF="DD01289.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01289.htm">Table 23</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> is the time the character actually spends brewing the potion. Once a potion-s
formula has been personally researched and recorded, the character need not
research it again unless the record is lost.
<P></P>
The chance to successfully brew a potion is 70%, +1% for every two levels of
the creator, and ?1% for each 100 gp the potion costs (detailed on Table 23).

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Scrolls
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The common material required is the paper, parchment, or papyrus as detailed
in Chapter 10 of the <A HREF="DMG_DD00528.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00528.htm">Dungeon Master Guide</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. The rare material is the quill; a new quill must be used for each spell
written on the scroll.
<P></P>
Blending the ink is the most important process. Ink for spells of levels 1?3
require a rare ingredient, spells of levels 4?6 require an exotic ingredient,
and spells of levels 7+ require one rare and one exotic ingredient. Blending the
ink takes one day, and the ink must be used within two weeks.
<P></P>
No spells are actually cast when writing a scroll, but the character must know
the relevant spell and have any required material components on hand. If
normally consumed in the casting, the material components are consumed in writing
the scroll. If casting the spell normally imposes a penalty on the caster, such
as magical aging, creating the scroll carries the same penalty.
<P></P>
The chance to successfully write a scroll is 80%, +1% for every level of the
creator, and ?1% for each level of the written spell. There are additional
adjustments for the materials used (see <A HREF="DMG_DD00528.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00528.htm">DMG</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, Chapter 10). The DM must roll for success separately for each spell on a
scroll. A scroll can hold 1d6 spells, determined secretly by the DM, but the
character knows when the scroll is full. A failed attempt to write a spell fills the
scroll but usually doesn-t affect spells already written on it (see the<B> <A HREF="DD01288.htm"></A></B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><B><A HREF="DD01288.htm">Failure</A></B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> section).
<P></P>
Compare protection scrolls to the level of the spell that approximates their
effects to determine the success chance and type of ink required. A <I>protection from magic</I> scroll, for example, is similar to <I>antimagic shell</I>, a 6th-level spell.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Rings
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Any ring requires one common process in addition to any extra materials or
processes needed for multiple functions or limited use. Discovering all the steps
required to make a ring requires 1d6+1 weeks of research and costs 200 gp a
week. Access to <I>contact other plane </I>or <I>commune</I> spells automatically reduces the required time to two weeks.
<P></P>
A ring also requires the <I>enchant an item</I> and <I>permanency</I> spells-or the equivalent priest ceremony-in addition to whatever spells are
needed to create the ring's powers (see <A HREF="DD01286.htm#c85fc1b1"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01286.htm#c85fc1b1">page 90</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). Multiple-use rings require one spell per use, and multiple-function rings
need one set of spells for each function.
<P></P>
The chance to successfully create a ring is 60%, +1% for every level of the
creator, and ?1% for each spell and special process required (except for the <I>enchant an item</I> spell). Priests, though they do not actually cast any spells, still suffer
the penalty for spells. The more complex the enchantment, the more difficult it
is to successfully petition the deity to imbue the item with power.

</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Rods, Staves, and Wands
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> These items require <I>enchant an item</I> spells-or the equivalent priest ceremonies-and whatever spells are needed to
create their powers. Multiple-function rods, staves, and wands need one spell
(or set of spells) for each function. A<I> permanency</I> spell is required.
<P></P>
The base chance to successfully create one of these items is the same as for a
ring. If the item is rechargeable, it is created with one charge and then
additional charges are added using the recharging procedure detailed below.
<P></P>
A rod, staff, or wand loses all its magical properties if it is ever drained
of all its charges, even if it is normally rechargeable. Once drained of
charges, the item can never be enchanted again.

</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Miscellaneous Magic, Armor, and Weapons</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
These items require <I>enchant an item</I> spells-or the equivalent priest ceremonies-and whatever spells are needed to
create their powers. Each plus for a weapon or protective device requires a
separate spell. Single-use and limited-use items do not require <I>permanency </I>spells, but other items do.
<P></P>
The chance to successfully create one of these items is the same as for a
ring. Rechargeable items are created with one charge to reduce the chance for
failure.
