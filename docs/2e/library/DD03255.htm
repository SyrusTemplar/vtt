With this power, a user can gain limited control over wind speed and
direction. The speed of any existing wind can be increased or decreased by 10 miles per
hour or 25%-whichever is greater. The direction of the wind can be changed by
up to 90 degrees. These changes are temporary, lasting only as long as the PSP
cost is paid. The changes occur in the round that the power is successfully
activated. The wind returns to its original course and speed the round that the PSP
cost is not paid.

Wind above 19 miles per hour prevents anything smaller than a human from
flying and imposes a ?4 modifier on missile fire. On the water, such wind makes
sailing difficult. Wind gusting at more than 32 miles per hour causes minor damage
to ships and buildings. This wind also kicks up clouds of dust and prevents all
but the largest creatures from flying. Wind more than 55 miles per hour
prevents all flight, knocks down trees and wooden buildings, and may swamp ships.
Wind more than 73 miles per hour is a hurricane gale.
