Wereravens are a race of wise and good-aligned shapechangers who seem to have
migrated to Ravenloft from another realm (probably Greyhawk) centuries ago.
While they are no longer found on their plane of origin, they have managed to
survive in Ravenloft.
<P></P>
Natural wereravens have three forms, that of a normal human, a huge raven, and
a hybrid of the two. Infected wereravens can assume only two of the above
forms. While all infected wereravens can take the human form, roughly half are able
to turn into hybrids while the others can transform into huge ravens.
<P></P>
The hybrid form of these creatures looks much like that of a werebat. The arms
grow long and thin, sprouting feathers and transforming into wings. The mouth
hardens and projects into a straight, pecking beak, and the eyes turn jet
black. A coat of feathers replaces the normal body hair of the human form.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Wereravens are deadly opponents in close combat, although they seldom engage
in it. Because they can be hit only by silver weapons or those with a +2 or
better magical bonus, these creatures do not fear most armed parties.
<P></P>
When in human form, a wereraven retains its natural immunities to certain
weapons, but has no real attack of its own. If forced to fight unarmed, it inflicts
a mere 1-2 points of damage. For this reason, wereravens in human form often
employ weapons, doing damage appropriate to the arms they wield.
<P></P>
In raven form, the wereraven attacks as if it were a common example of that
creature. Thus, it inflicts but 1-2 points of damage but has a 1 in 10 chance of
scoring an eye peck with each successful attack. Any eye peck will cause the
target to lose the use of one eye until a <I>heal</I> or <I>regeneration</I> spell can be cast on the victim. Half-blinded persons (those who have lost 1
eye) suffer a -2 on all attack rolls. A second eye peck results in total
blindness until the above cure can be affected.
<P></P>
In hybrid form, the wereraven's arms have grown into wings, making them almost
useless in combat. However, the muscles in their mouths/beaks strengthen,
giving them a savage bite. Each attack made with the creature's beak inflicts 2d6
points of
<P></P>
damage.
<P></P>
Anyone bitten or pecked by the wereraven has a 2% chance per point of damage
inflicted of becoming an infected wereraven. Infected lycanthropes are discussed
in the <I>Ravenloft Boxed Set.
<P></P>
</I> Wereravens are strong flyers and often use this ability to their advantage in
combat.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A wereraven family will be found only at the heart of a dense forest. Here,
they live in the hollowed out body of a great tree. Entrance to their lair is
possible only from above (if one does not wish to cut or break through the trunk
itself). Curiously, the wereravens are able to keep the tree in which they nest
from dying even after they have hollowed it out, so it is difficult to
distinguish from the normal trees around it.
<P></P>
Wereravens recognize that they are bastions of good in a land dominated by
evil. They have managed to survive by avoiding large populations or overt acts of
good that would draw the attention of the reigning lords to them. Thus, a
wereraven flock will generally have no more than 2-8 adults in it. Of course, such
groups have young with them (1-4 per 2 adults), but these are seldom encountered
for they remain in a true raven state until they are old enough to fend for
themselves. In addition, a typical wereraven lair will draw 10-100 (10d10) common
ravens to nest in the trees about it. These wise birds will serve the
wereravens, doing their bidding and striving to protect them from harm.
<P></P>
Wereravens are not opposed to helping out the cause of good in Ravenloft, but
they do so reluctantly. This is not because they do not wish to do good, but
because they fear the wrath of the Dark Powers. It is said that the wereravens
have come to the aid of endangered Vistani clans on several occasions and that
close ties exist between these two races, but neither will admit this openly.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Wereravens are omnivores who prefer to maintain a vegetarian diet. They enjoy
berries and nuts, but will eat carrion or kill for fresh meat from time to time
in order to maintain good health.
