<P></P>
This is a god who delivers broad statements about the future to his followers.
He's distinct from the god of Fate/Destiny in that he doesn't preach a
doctrine of acceptance; he just passes on the visions he has of the future, and lets
his followers and those who beg his visions act on them accordingly.
<P></P>
Priests of this god act as intermediaries between the oracular god and
visitors who come to receive his prophecies. See the paragraph below on Followers and
Strongholds for more on this.

The oracular god is as likely to be male as female.

Dawn, Fate/Destiny, Light, Magic, Moon, Sun, and Wisdom.

<B>Followers and Strongholds:</B> The followers are received at 9th level, and consist of one fifth-level
priest, three third-level priests, and six first-level priests of the same order,
plus five second-level fighters who act as guards. The priest may take the
following on adventures: Three priests (not including the fifth-level priest, and may
only include one third-level priest) and two fighters of his choice. The
priesthood will pay for half of the cost of stronghold construction at 9th level.
Part of the stronghold must be an oracular chamber or area where visitors may
meet with the priests and receive oracles; the temple may charge a fee of money or
goods for this service, so the stronghold must also have large, commodious
storerooms for these goods.
