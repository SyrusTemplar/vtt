A wizard player character engaged in magical research might require a
particular component that exists only in a hard-to-reach part of the world. If the
journey promises to be dangerous, the wizard might ask his friends to accompany
him. Alternately, if a PC wizard encounters a party going in the same direction,
he might agree to assist them on their mission in exchange for safe passage to
the location of his sought component. After recovering the component, the wizard
might have become close enough to the other PCs to voluntarily continue on
their mission with them. Or maybe the other PCs got the wizard out of a tough spot
and the wizard feels obligated to return the favor by completing the mission
with them.

The party's mission might coincide with something the wizard PC wants. For
instance, the party might be embarking on a mission to stop a notorious evil
wizard. The evil wizard might possess a magical device the PC wizard has coveted for
a long time. The PC wizard could agree to help the party in exchange for the
magical device.
