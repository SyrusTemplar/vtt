This spell temporarily animates the physical remains of a human, demihuman, or
humanoid.<I> Bone dance</I> forges a mystical link with the newly made undead creature, enabling the
caster to mentally control its movements, just as a master puppeteer manipulates
the actions of a wooden puppet.
<P></P>
The skeleton or zombie animated by this spell is incapable of carrying out any
independent actions—the wizard must mentally command his or her undead puppet
to walk forward, pick up a sword, strike an opponent with it, and so on. While
the caster concentrates on maintaining the <I>bone dance</I>, he or she may not speak, cast other spells, or actively engage in melee. The
spell occupies the greater part of the caster’s attention.
<P></P>
The skeleton or zombie created by this spell conforms to the normal variety
described in the <I>MM</I>. It is compatible with (can be affected by) other necromantic spells that
affect undead, and the creature may perform all of the simple actions outlined in
the <I>skeletal hands</I> spell. If directed into combat, it fights as a regular skeleton (even if it
still has some flesh on its bones).
<P></P>
When combined with <I>spectral voice</I>,<I> bone dance</I> can make for an effective decoy, a menacing bluff, or at least a ghastly form
of entertainment. When augmented by corpse link, a dancing cadaver may serve
as an effective (and ultimately expendable) scout that can work beyond the
immediate visual range of the caster.
<P></P>
Normally, the bone dance progresses for the duration of the spell or until
the caster loses concentration. The <I>dance</I> also ends prematurely if the caster causes the skeleton to move beyond spell
range or out of direct sight (certain divinations, such as <I>corpse link</I> or <I>clairvoyance</I>, may lift this hindrance). The bone dance may be destroyed in combat, or
broken by a successful <I>dispel magic</I>. The material component is an intact skeleton or corpse and a small, crude
puppet which the caster must manipulate with both hands to choreograph the<I> bone dance</I>.
