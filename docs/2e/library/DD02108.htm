When an <I>imprisonment</I> spell is cast and the victim is touched, the recipient is entombed in a state
of suspended animation (see the 9th-level wizard spell <A HREF="DD02116.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="DD02116.htm">temporal stasis</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth. The victim remains
there unless a reverse of the spell, with the creature's name and background, is
cast. Magical search by a <I>crystal ball</I>, a <I>locate object</I> spell, or similar means will not reveal the fact that a creature is
imprisoned. The <I>imprisonment</I> spell functions only if the subject creature's name and background are known.
<P></P>
The reverse spell, <I>freedom,</I> cast upon the spot at which a creature was entombed and sunk into the earth,
causes it to reappear at that spot. If the caster does not perfectly intone the
name and background of the creature to be freed, there is a 10% chance that 1
to 100 creatures will be freed from imprisonment at the same time.
<P></P>
Note: The exact details of any creatures freed are up to the DM. A random
method of determining this is to roll percentile dice twice (once for imprisoned
creature density and once for a base number of creatures at maximum density). The
rolls are multiplied and rounded to the nearest whole number. Each released
creature has a 10% chance to be in the area of the spellcaster. If monsters are
being generated randomly, roll 1d20 for level, with rolls of 9+ considered 9,
and the exact monsters determined by the <A HREF="DMG_DD00547.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00547.htm">random encounter tables</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
For example, if the initial rolls were 22 and 60, the number of monsters
released is.22 x.60 =.1320 = 13 monsters. Since only 10% of these will be in the
immediate vicinity of the caster, the wizard may encounter only one or two of them.
