<FONT SIZE="3">The wizard Kerith was noted for his astounding lack of
courage in the face of even the most insignificant dangers. He
developed this spell early in his career to assist him in his
frequent and precipitous withdrawals from combat. When cast, <I>expeditious
retreat </I>provides the wizard with an amazing fleetness of foot,
enabling him to run in great leaps and bounds. The caster&#146;s
movement rate is tripled for the duration of the spell, so a wizard
with a movement of 12 would be able to run at a rate of 36 while the
spell was in effect. In addition, the wizard can jump up to 5 feet in
the air or make a 15-foot horizontal leap with ease. The wizard does
not have to move while the spell is in effect, but if he moves at
all, his unnatural speed and bounds prevent him from taking any other
actions except for running&#151;in other words, he can&#146;t take a
half-move and throw a missile, or charge, cast a spell, or do
anything else except move.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The wizard cannot increase his movement further by any
means, including additional movement-affecting magical spells or
items. Kerith was also noted for his cynical observation to a
companion: &#147;I don&#146;t have to outrun the troll. I just have
to outrun you.&#148;</FONT></P>
