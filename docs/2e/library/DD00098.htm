The gaff or hook is actually a tool used to hook and land fish. It is commonly
found where fishing boats are encountered, and the hooks are in plentiful
supply, affording the disarmed adventurer a weapon of last resort.
<P></P>
The gaff consists of a metal hook with a wooden or metal crossbar at the base.
A one-handed tool, the hook protrudes from between the middle and ring fingers.

Some sailors who have lost a hand have a cup with a gaff hook attached to the
stump, guaranteeing that they are never without a weapon.

&quot;Ya don't often see adventurers whacking away with gaffs. To them, it's only a
tool. But more often than not, dock workers, press gangs, pirates, and sailors
have a pretty good swing with those hooks.''
