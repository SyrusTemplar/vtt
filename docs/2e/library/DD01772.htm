<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> At times it is useful for characters to look at objects or creatures via
reflections in a mirror. This is particularly true of those creatures so hideous
(such as a medusa) that gazing directly upon them might turn the viewer to stone.
When using a mirror, a light source must be present. Second, attempting to
direct your actions by looking in a mirror is very disorienting (try it and see).
Thus, all actions requiring an ability or proficiency check or an attack roll
suffer a -2 penalty. The character also loses all Dexterity bonuses to Armor
Class if fighting an opponent seen only in a mirror.
