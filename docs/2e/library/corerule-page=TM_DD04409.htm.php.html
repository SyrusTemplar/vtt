This spell enchants the priest's robe or cloak, enabling him to walk among
wounded creatures and heal them. By touching the robe, a wounded creature is cured
of 1d4+4 hit points. As many creatures as can physically touch the robe within
the spell duration can be healed. A reasonable maximum is 20 creatures per
round, allowing a total of 1,200 creatures to be healed. A creature can be
affected only once per week by the <I>robe of healing</I>.
