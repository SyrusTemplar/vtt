Every true dweomer requires some object or group of objects to assist in
casting the spell. The rarer and more difficult a material component is, the easier
it is to complete the enchantment. To be effective, however, a material
component must be symbolic of what the spell does. For example, destroying a large
diamond is costly but ineffective unless the spell has something to do with
protecting or destroying something of value (the caster literally pays the price for
the item that is effective), overcoming resistance (gem-quality diamonds don-t
exactly grow on trees, so finding one and destroying it represents a small
triumph of sorts), or command over the element of earth (because a diamond is a
rare mineral). There is no easy way to choose a material component for a spell;
like choosing materials for a magical item (see <A HREF="DD01320.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01320.htm">page 90</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">), the process requires a great deal of imagination and guesswork. The various
spell descriptions in the <I>Player-s Handbook </I>provide examples to follow.

Wizards do not need spellbooks to cast true dweomers, although a set of
written notes about how to go about creating the spell can be helpful.

Priest true dweomers require holy symbols in addition to other components.
Holy symbols are not consumed when a true dweomer is cast, but other material
components are. Priests can benefit from written notes in the same manner as
wizards.
