With this spell, a wizard establishes a sensory link between him- or herself
and any living creature within range. If the wizard knows a specific creature or
person within range, then the spell can take effect on that specific creature.
Otherwise, the <I>living link</I> will be established with any sentient creature within range, determined
randomly.
<P></P>
Similar to the 1st-level spell <I>corpse link</I> (which only works with fresh cadavers and zombies), <I>living link</I> allows the caster to gather sensory information from the vicinity of the
targeted creature (sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch). For every four levels of
experience past the 1st, the wizard can collect information from an additional
sense (up to two senses at 5th level, three at 9th, four at 13th, and all five
at the 17th level of experience).
<P></P>
The target creature of this spell experiences nothing to indicate that its
senses have been tapped, and it remains in control of its own actions, entirely
unaware of the magical connection to the wizard. In other words, the wizard
cannot force the subject to look at something (listen at a keyhole, taste a glass of
wine, pick up an object, and so on). This spell merely enables the wizard to
directly experience the world through another creature’s perceptions. For
instance, looking through another creature’s eyes gives the wizard all of its visual
capabilities, like infravision should the creature have that ability.
<P></P>
While the spell is in effect, the <I>living link</I> overrides the wizard’s own sensory perceptions. Thus, while a wizard is
seeing through another creature’s eyes, he or she is unable to see through his or
her own. The spell can be ended early with no risk to the caster.
