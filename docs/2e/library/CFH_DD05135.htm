You can only take one Warrior Kit for your character.
<P></P>
You can only take a Warrior Kit for your character when that character is
first created.
<P></P>
There's an exception to that second rule: If you and your DM both want to
integrate these rules into an existing campaign, and both DM and players can agree
upon what Warrior Kit each existing player-character most closely resembles,
then you can use these rules for existing characters, adding a Warrior Kit to
each existing character.
<P></P>
Once you've taken a Warrior Kit, you cannot change it. Later in the
character's life, he can possibly <I>abandon</I> his Kit; see &quot;Abandoning A Kit,&quot; later in this chapter.
