The three warrior character classes (Fighter, Paladin, and Ranger) are still
the <I>only</I> warrior character classes. However, those players who would like to have more
specialized warrior classes will probably find what they want in the<I> Warrior Kits</I> chapter.
<P></P>
When you're creating single-class warrior characters, we recommend that you
start all first-level warriors with the maximum number of hit points they can
have at that levelâ€”don't even bother to roll the dice. In other words, if you have
a first-level Fighter with a Constitution of 16, he'd start with 12 hit points
instead of rolling his 1d10 and adding +2 for his Constitution adjustment.
<P></P>
This is for a couple of important reasons. First, it gives the warrior a
slightly better chance for survival at lower experience levels. Second, it reflects
the fact that warriors are simply tougher and hardier than other
player-character classes.
<P></P>
But remember: This is for<I> first level single-class warriors only</I>. Starting with second level, these Fighters, Paladins, and Rangers have to
roll their hit points like everyone else. No other class gets this benefit, and
multi-class warriors (such as warrior/thieves, warrior/mages, and the like)
don't get to do this.
