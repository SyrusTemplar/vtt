<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Smoke Powder:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This magical substance is similar, though not identical, to gunpowder. It is
extremely scarce and, due to its volatile nature, dangerous to fabricate. <I>Smoke powder</I> will be available in a campaign only if the DM allows it. If the DM doesn't
want it in the campaign, it simply doesn't exist.
<P></P>
<I>Smoke powder</I> is commonly found divided into two separate components?one, a steely-blue
granular substance, the other, a fine white powder. Alone, each component is inert
and harmless. However, when equal portions of the two are mixed together, the <I>smoke powder</I> is complete and dangerous.
<P></P>
When touched by a flame, the mixed powder explodes with great force, noise,
and smoke. The size and force of the explosion varies according to the amount of <I>smoke powder</I> used. A small, measured amount (a spoonful of each component) causes 1d2
points of damage. Such an amount is sufficient for a large firecracker or a single
charge of an arquebus (if these optional weapons exist in the campaign).
Increasing the amount increases the damage proportionally?doubling causes 2d2 points
of damage, tripling causes 3d2, and so on.
<P></P>
An explosion capable of causing 30 points of damage (15 charges) has a 5-foot
radius. Blasts capable of causing 50 or more points of damage (25 or more
charges) have a radius of 15 feet, and affect items and fortifications as would a
giant's blow.
<P></P>
When discovered, a pouch of <I>smoke powder</I> contains 3d6 charges. Charges from several pouches of <I>smoke powder</I> can be combined to create bigger, more damaging explosions.
