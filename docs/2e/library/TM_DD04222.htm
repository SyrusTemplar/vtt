When this spell is cast, the illusionist transforms one creature or a
specified amount of non-living material into shadow, making it insubstantial. Thus, a
door could be turned to shadow and entered. The maximum amount of inanimate
material that may be transformed is one cubic foot per level of the caster.
<P></P>
Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw to resist the <I>shadowy transformation</I>. Magical items and the magical effects of spells (such as <I>Bigby's forceful hand</I> or a <I>wall of stone</I> ) cannot be affected.
<P></P>
A transformed creature and all its gear become insubstantial. The creature can
pass through small holes, narrow openings, and the smallest cracks. The
creature cannot fly without additional magic.
<P></P>
No form of attack is possible when in shadow form except against creatures
that exist on the Ethereal plane. In this case, all attacks are normal; however,
the shadowy creature may be harmed only by magical weapons of +1 or greater or
by creatures able to affect those struck only by magical weapons. Spells and
special attacks have normal effects.
<P></P>
Most undead creatures will ignore a creature in shadow form, believing it to
be a wraith or spectre; however, liches and powerful undead may save vs. spell
with a -4 penalty to recognize the spell. A successful <I>dispel magic</I> spell forces the creature in shadow form back to normal form.
