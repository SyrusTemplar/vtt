This field consists of a long strip of ground with a low fence along the
middle of it; the jousters ride toward one another, each with the fence to his left,
and make jousting passes until one or the other is dismounted.
<P></P>
Along one or both long sides of the list, stands are set up for onlookers.
There may be a box or special seating area for the local ruler and his retinue.
<P></P>
At both ends of the list, where the horses turn around, are racks of lances
for the riders' use. At one end of the list is an exit to the field where the
knights and other participants have their tents set up.
