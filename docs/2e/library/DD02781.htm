<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Escalades </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Technically, an escalade is an attempt to storm a castle or fort by scaling
the walls, usually with ladders. Rules for doing so are included here, but this
section also includes rules for other types of actions that can take place
during a <I>Player?s Option</I> combat scenario, including combat between war machines.
