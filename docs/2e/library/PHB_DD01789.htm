</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Aside from jumping or flying, the quickest way to get down from a height is to
rappel. This requires a rope attached at the top of the climb and a skilled
mountaineer to set up the rappel and to hold the rope at the bottom. When
rappeling down a surface, a Climbing check with a +50 bonus must be rolled. Free
rappels (with the end of the rope unsupported at the bottom) are also possible, but
the modifier is only +30. Of course, a failed check results in a slip sometime
during the rappel (the DM decides on the damage suffered). A character can
rappel at a speed equal to his normal dungeon movement (120 feet per round for an
unencumbered human). One other thing to bear in mind is that there must be a
landing point at the end of the rope. Rappelling 60 feet down a 100-foot cliff
means the character is either stranded at the end of the rope or, worse still,
rappels right off the end and covers the last 40 feet much faster than he did the
first 60!
