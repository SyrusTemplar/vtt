The Middle Ages (roughly from 1100 to 1450) is the period in which most
fantasy campaigns are set. It was the period most people associate with knighthood
and chivalry. The knights went off on the Crusades. Great stone castles were
built. The role of traders and merchants began to grow. Virtually all the items on
the equipment list were available in this time period.
