This god is a god of authentication: He bestows his blessings on the kings of
various cities or countries so that all will know the god supports that king
and his family. Usually, the god provides the king with some artifact indicating
his approval... and magically takes back the artifact when he withdraws his
approval. (The artifact is usually a crown or a sceptre; these are two
near-universal symbols of kingship.)
<P></P>
The god's priests are advisors to kings. They analyze politics and make
recommendations. They intensively research the genealogy and history of the king's
families, the better to authenticate his hold on the throne. At their god's
behest, they may participate in the overthrow of a king. Many of these priests do
travel, in order to acquire more information about the king or to head off plots
against him.
<P></P>
In a male-dominated society, this deity will be male. In a female-dominated
society, this deity will be female. In a more equal society, the god may be of
either sex.

The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Community,
Culture, Messengers, Peace, and War.

<B>Duties of the Priest:</B> Guidance, Marriage. Missions: When a ruler sees opportunities to strengthen
his throne or eliminate problems that might endanger his throne, he often asks
for priests of this sect to accompany the adventurers he dispatches; the local
temples usually cooperate and provide adventurer priests to accompany those
parties. Vigilance: These priests are required to stay alert against forces which
threaten the local thrones. This includes foreign intrigue and even internal
problems; if a local king has become corrupt and tyrannical, and the local
population is edging toward rebellion, these priests may put pressure on the king to
shape up... or may even oppose or depose him, so that the throne will remain
strong under a new, better ruler.
