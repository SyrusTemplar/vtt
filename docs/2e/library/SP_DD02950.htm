one of a group, or pantheon, of deities. He acts in a manner appropriate to
his deity, and uses his powers and skills to help others advance the beliefs of
his religion.
<P></P>
All priest characters can cast spells granted them by their deity, wear many
types of armor, and use many weapons.
<P></P>
Priest spells are divided into Spheres of Influence, which mirror the
interests of the priest’s deity. A priest either has Major or Minor access to a sphere.
Major access means that a priest potentially can cast any spell in that
sphere. Minor access indicates that the priest can cast only first- through
third-level spells from that sphere. The <A HREF="DD02951.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02951.htm">spell progression</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> for a priest is presented below.
