</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The characteristics of a battlefield can often change the nature of an
encounter by limiting movement, visibility, or missile fire. For example, charging is
impossible in waist-deep water, and archery is ineffective in dense forest.
Battlefields are described with six general characteristics: encounter range,
lines of fire, cover, footing, obstacles, and materials or hazards that can be
found there.
