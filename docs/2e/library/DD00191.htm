Players in most AD&amp;D games use the same character over many game sessions.
Most players develop strong ties to their characters and get a thrill from
watching them advance, grow, and become more successful and powerful. Your game's
success depends on how much your players care about their characters. For these
reasons, it is important to let they players create the type of characters they
really want to play.
<P></P>
At the same time, watch out for a tendency in some players to want the most
powerful character possible. Powerful characters are fine if that's the sort of
campaign you want. A problem arises, however, if players are allowed to exploit
the rules, or your good nature, to create a character who is much more powerful
than everyone else's characters. At best, this leads to an unbalanced game. At
worst, it leads to bored players and hurt feelings.
<P></P>
Therefore, before any player in your game creates his first character, decide
which dice-rolling method to allow: will you use method I, any of the five
alternate methods, or a seventh method of your own devising? Be prepared with an
answer right away, because this is one of the first questions your players will
ask.
