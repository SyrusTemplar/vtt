Some people are possessed of an amazing ability to drive themselves on despite
injuries or exhaustion that would stop another person in his tracks. A
character with the iron will talent gains a +1 bonus to saving throws vs.
mind-affecting spells or effects, including <I>charms, holds, hypnotism, fascination, suggestion,</I> and other such spells.
<P></P>
In addition, characters with iron will have the unqiue ability to keep
fighting even after being reduced to negative hit points. Each round that the
character wishes to remain conscious, he must roll a successful saving throw vs. death
with his negative hit point total as a modifier to the roll. For example, a
character reduced to ?5 hit points can try to stay on his feet and keep moving and
fighting by succeeding on a saving throw roll with a ?5 penalty. As long as
the character remains conscious, his condition does not worsen-in other words, he
doesn-t begin to lose 1 additional hit point per round until he actually
passes out.
