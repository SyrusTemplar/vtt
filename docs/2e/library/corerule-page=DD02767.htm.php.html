Ramming occurs when vehicles (including creatures carrying howdahs) attack
each other directly. A ramming attack is resolved during the attacker’s movement
phase.
<P></P>
If a vehicle attacks another vehicle, make an opposed driving roll. The
following modifiers apply:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> +1 for each size class larger than the opponent;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> +1 for having more wheels or legs than the opponent.
<P></P>
<P></P>
If the defender wins the roll, one of the attacker’s wheels, as determined by
the DM, must roll a successful saving throw vs. crushing blow (see <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00331.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00331.htm.php.html">DMG</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, Table 29). If the roll fails, the wheel breaks and the attacking vehicle
flips over. If the attacker wins the roll, one of the defender’s wheels must roll
vs. crushing blow as above. If the wheel does not break, the defender still
must make a driving check to avoid flipping over.
<P></P>
If a creature attacks a vehicle, the vehicle’s driver rolls an opposed driving
check vs. the creature’s effective Strength score. If the creature wins the
roll, the vehicle flips over. A creature cannot attack a vehicle in this fashion
unless it is at least as large as the vehicle. If the vehicle wins the roll,
the creature must veer away from the vehicle.
<P></P>
If a vehicle attacks a creature that is too large to be overrun, use the
procedure outlined above. If the vehicle wins the roll, the creature must move one
square, just as though it had been overrun (but the attacking vehicle inflicts
no damage).
<P></P>
If an attacker tries to ram an unattended vehicle, use the procedures outlined
above. The unattended vehicle has a default driving skill of 5.
