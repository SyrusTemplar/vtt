<FONT SIZE="3">By casting this spell, the wizard gains the power to
corrode ferrous metals and alloys at a touch. Iron and iron-based
alloys such as steel, meteoric iron, mithral, and adamantite are
affected, but noble metals such as gold, silver, and copper are not
subject to reduction through rusting. Any ferrous metal touched by
the wizard must make an item saving throw vs. disintegration (usually
a 17 or better on a d20) or be destroyed. Magical arms or armor may
apply their bonus to this save, so a sword +3 would gain a +3 to its
roll. Other magical metal items may receive a +1 to a +6 bonus based
on the DM&#146;s estimate of their power.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The wizard may employ <I>rusting grasp </I>in combat
by simply touching the equipment of metal-wearing characters or
creatures. If he tries to touch the armor of a character, the wizard
need only hit the opponents unarmored AC. If the armor fails its
save, <I>rusting grasp </I>permanently destroys 2d4 points of AC
through corrosion. For example, <I>plate mail +3</I> (base AC 0)
could be reduced to a base AC of 2 to 8 if it fails its item saving throw.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Weapons are more difficult to grasp; the wizard must
make an attack roll against AC 4 (modified by the opponent&#146;s
Dexterity) in order to touch the weapon. If the weapon fails its
saving throw, it is destroyed. Important note: The wizard must touch
the weapon and not the other way around! Unlike a rust monster, he
doesn&#146;t corrode weapons simply by being hit.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Against metallic creatures, <I>rusting grasp </I>functions
like the priest spell <I>cause serious wounds </I>in that it
inflicts 2d8+1 point of damage per successful attack. The spell lasts
for one round per level, and the wizard can make one touch attack per
round. The material component is an antenna from a rust monster.</FONT></P>
