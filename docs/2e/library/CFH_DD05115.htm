<P></P>
To craft armor, the character must first have a <I>workshop </I>(a place to work and tools with which to do work).
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Metal<B> </B>Armor
<P></P>
</I>
<P></P>
If he intends to make any sort of all-metal armor (chain mail, field mail,
full plate, plate mail, and helmets), the workshop is a <I>smithy</I>, complete with tools, bellows, a furnace, an anvil, tongs, cauldrons, casting
molds, and all the other materials necessary to process unrefined metal into
armor.
<P></P>
Such a workshop costs 200 gp, plus the cost of the shelter where it is set up:
An additional 100 gp for a pavilion tent, an additional 300 gp for a
well-crafted hut/workshop, or more as part of a larger dwelling, such as a mansion,
villa or castle (these sorts of dwellings are priced at whatever sort of price
scheme the DM prefers).
<P></P>
(Included in the price of the <I>smithy</I> is the cost of the tools necessary to make leather hilt-wrappings, padded
armor, armor linings and padding, and the simple leather straps used to hold
all-metal armors together.)
<P></P>
This workshop is large enough to accommodate the character and up to two
apprentices working full-time. (The apprentices, too, must have the Armorer
proficiency; the character can always take in an apprentice without the proficiency and
train him, but until he acquires the Armorer proficiency he doesn't count as a
productive element of the workshop.)
<P></P>
In theory, the character could hire another three-man crew to work a second
shift in the same workshop; thus the workshop would be occupied nearly 24 hours a
day. (This presumes eight- to ten-hour shifts and a certain amount of
necessary nonproductive time each day: Time for furnaces to cool and be cleaned, tools
to be repaired and sharpened, etc.) No more than three people can work in this
workshop effectively; with more than three people, the workshop suffers a loss
of efficiency so that it produces goods just as though it were only manned by
three armorers.
<P></P>
To expand the workshop costs an additional 50% for each +three workers. If the
smithy costs 200 gp and is set up in a 300-gp hut, thus costing 500 gp, the
builder could pay +250 gp. Then, the workshop would accommodate three more
armorers at the same time. For another +250 gp, now totalling 1,000 gp, the shop can
accommodate nine armorers at the same time.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Leather Armor
<P></P>
<P></P>
</I> If he intends to make any sort of all-leather armor (hide armor, leather
armor, and armored leather caps), the workshop is a <I>leatherworker's shop</I>, including apparatus for leather soaking, scraping, tanning, boiling, boiling
in wax, shaping, hole-punching, sewing, and all the other processes by which
leather is transformed into armor.
<P></P>
Such a workshop costs 25 gp, plus the cost of the shelter where it is set up:
An additional 25 gp for a large tent, an additional 75 gp for a well-crafted
hut/workshop, or more as part of a larger dwelling (at whatever price scheme the
DM prefers).
<P></P>
(Included in the price of the<I> leatherworker's shop</I> is the cost of the tools necessary to make padded armor and armor linings and
padding.)
<P></P>
As with the smithy above, this price presumes one principal leatherworker and
up to two apprentices may work together at the same time. Above that number
costs 50% of the workshop and housing costs per additional three leatherworkers.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Metal and Leather Armor
<P></P>
<P></P>
</I> If he intends to make both sorts of armor, or armor which combines both metal
and leather elements (banded mail, brigandine, bronze plate mail, ring mail,
scale mail, shields, splint mail, and studded leather), a combined workshop is
needed.
<P></P>
Such a workshop costs 250 gp, plus the cost of the shelter where it is set up:
An additional 100 gp for a pavilion tent, an additional 300 gp for a
well-crafted hut/workshop, or more as part of a larger dwelling (again, at whatever
pricing the DM prefers).
<P></P>
(Included in the cost of the <I>armorer's shop</I> is the cost of the tools necessary to make wooden shield blanks and shield
frames, padded armor, and all armor linings and padding necessary to the armored
goods.)
<P></P>
As with the smithy above, this price presumes one principal armorer and up to
two apprentices; above that number costs +50% of the workshop and housing costs
per additional three armorers.
