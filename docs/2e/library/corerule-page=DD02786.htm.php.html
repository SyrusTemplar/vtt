</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This is the best way for an unskilled climber to get up a wall. Carrying a
ladder requires two Man-sized creatures per 10 feet of length. The carriers move
as though heavily encumbered. A ladder can be put in position against a wall in
the End-of-Round step of any round when it is carried to the base of the wall.
A ladder must be at least as long as the wall is tall, plus five feet. A
character can climb four feet of ladder per movement point each round.
<P></P>
Defenders atop a wall can use an attack to push a ladder away. If the ladder
is not braced or loaded with climbers, the attempt always succeeds. Otherwise,
the ladder falls if the defender makes a successful open doors roll. Trying to
push a ladder away provokes attacks of opportunity if the defender is threatened.
<P></P>
When a climber reaches the top of a wall, he can step onto the wall during the
roundâ€™s resolution phase if there is an empty square in front of him (this
could provoke an attack of opportunity). If there is no empty square, the climber
must slay a defender or force a retreat and create an empty square before
stepping from the ladder.
