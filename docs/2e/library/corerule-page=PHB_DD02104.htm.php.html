The magic of this spell causes metal, whether as soft as gold or as hard as
adamantite, to turn to a crystalline substance as brittle and fragile as crystal.
Thus, a sword, metal shield, metal armor, or even an iron golem can be changed
to a delicate, glasslike material easily shattered by any forceful blow.
Furthermore, this change is unalterable by any means short of a <I>wish</I> spell; a <I>dispel magic</I> will not reverse the spell.
<P></P>
The caster must physically touch the item; if it is an opponent or something
an opponent is using or wearing, the wizard must get into melee and make a
successful attack roll. Any single metal item can be affected by the spell. Thus, a
suit of armor worn by a creature can be changed to crystal, but the creature's
shield would not be affected, and vice versa. All items gain a saving throw
equal to their magical bonus value or protection (the DM has this information). A
+1/+3 sword would get a 10% (average of the two pluses) chance to save; +5
magical armor has a 25% chance to be unaffected; an iron golem has a 15% chance to
save (for it is hit only by magical weapons of +3 or better quality). Artifacts
and relics constructed of metal may be affected at the discretion of the DM,
though it is highly unlikely. Affected items not immediately protected are
shattered and permanently destroyed if struck by a normal blow from a metal tool or
any weighty weapon, including a staff.
