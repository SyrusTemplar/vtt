Typical of lawful and non-good societies, officers of the law are vigilant
against thieves and their guilds. They are not easily bribeable, and there may be
rewards (money, medals, etc.) for watch officers arresting many thieves or
busting a guild. Penalties for thievery are usually harsh. There will be very few
corrupt officers of the law. Busting a captured thief from prison will be very
difficult-prisons and gaols will be strongly built, heavily guarded, and tough
to get into (cue for an exciting adventure here!).
