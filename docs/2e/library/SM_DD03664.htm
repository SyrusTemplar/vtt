This spell enhances the caster’s movement capabilities in extraplanar settings
by attuning him to his new surroundings. While very few 1st-level priests find
themselves in this situation, higher level characters often make use of this
spell. <I>Astral celerity </I>doubles the character’s movement rate on the Astral Plane; normally,
characters move at a rate of 30 times their Intelligence score in feet per round, but
this spell increases this to 60 feet times their Intelligence score. As an
incidental benefit, the caster also attunes himself to the plane much faster and
suffers no penalties for missile fire while astral.
<P></P>
While <I>astral celerity </I>is most often used in the astral plane, it also offers a small benefit to
ethereal characters, too: their movement rates are increased by 50%, so a character
with a movement rate of 12 would enjoy a movement rate of 18 while this spell
was in effect. Of course, time and distance have little meaning in the overall
scheme of the Astral or Ethereal Planes, but <I>relative </I>speed could be very important in avoiding an unpleasant encounter or escaping
from pursuit of some kind.
