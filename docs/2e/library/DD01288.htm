Magic is tricky and involves many constantly changing variables, causing each
enchantment to differ slightly from prior attempts. No matter how many times a
character has created a particular magical item, the chances for success remain

enchantments cannot be mastered.

Each attempt to create a magical item requires a roll for success. The DM
secretly rolls the dice to see if the attempt to create a magical item succeeds.
Any roll of 96?00 fails automatically.

Most failed attempts ruin the item, melting it into useless slag or destroying
it in some other dramatic fashion. A failed attempt to write a spell on a
scroll fills the remaining space with a useless blob of ink, leaving spells already
successfully written intact.

normally but has a cursed or reversed effect instead. The DM decides the nature of the
curse, using the cursed items from the magical item lists in the <A HREF="DMG_DD00521.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00521.htm">Dungeon Master Guide</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> and <A HREF="TM_DD04129.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="TM_DD04129.htm">Tome of Magic</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> as a reference.
