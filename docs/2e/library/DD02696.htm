<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Anada, the elf warrior from the two previous examples, is sneaking through the
bugbear lair with a morning star in hand. He still wears his <I>chain mail +1</I>. The bugbears are quick to note escape and three of them corner him in an
unused chamber. The trio decides to rush Anada and take his weapon away.
<P></P>
The three bugbears make a combined overbearing attack against Anada. Because
he is armed, Anada can make attacks of opportunity against the bugbears. As an
8th-level fighter, Anada is entitled to up to four attacks of opportunity, but
he only gets three since there are only three bugbears. Anada gets lucky and
hits all three times. No hits kill any bugbears, but he scores a knockdown chance
against one of them. The bugbear fails its saving throw roll vs. death and is
knocked down. It cannot participate in the overbearing attack. Even if the save
was successful, the bugbear could not participate in the attack because it
suffered a knockdown chance.
<P></P>
The two remaining bugbears must hit AC 8 (because of Anada’s magical chain
mail and 15 Dexterity). They hit, and there is an opposed Strength roll to see if
Anada is overborne. The bugbears receive a +4 bonus because they are larger
than Anada and an additional +1 because there are two of them; their effective
Strength score for this attack is 19. Anada rolls a 16, higher than his adjusted
Strength score. The bugbears roll a 13, easily a success. Anada goes down, with
the bugbears on top, in the square where he stood. Anada can do nothing except
await the bugbears’ pin attempt.
<P></P>
The next round, the bugbears attempt a pin. The third bugbear jumps on the
pile, increasing the bugbears’ bonus to +6. Anada rolls a 15, exactly what he
needs to succeed with his Strength score. The bugbears roll a 10, a success, but
Anada succeeded with a higher roll, so he wins. Because he was not pinned Anada
can spend a half move regaining his feet and attack with his morning star. His
blows do not slay any bugbears, and another bugbear enters the chamber and joins
the fray.
<P></P>
All four bugbears attempt to overbear Anada during the next round. Anada gets
an attack of opportunity against each of them and slays one. The three
survivors make a combined attack and hit AC 8, forcing another opposed Strength roll.
The bugbears win, and Anada goes down again. Once again, Anada can do nothing
but await the pin attempt.
<P></P>
The three bugbears win the next opposed roll, pinning Anada. Both of Anada’s
arms and one of his legs are pinned. The DM decides that the bugbear holding
Anada’s leg is prone, and allows the elf to kick (pummel) that bugbear. Anada hits
and scores a knockdown against the bugbear, making it let go of his leg.
<P></P>
The two remaining bugbears try to maintain the pin during the next round, and
the bugbear who was knocked loose joins the pile. Anada wins the opposed roll.
Because he was pinned, Anada can only regain his feet, he cannot break free or
launch any other attacks.
<P></P>
Anada wins initiative, however, and can attack before the bugbears can do
anything. His morning star is too large to use while grappled, so Anada decides to
break free with an opposed attack roll (taking advantage of his superior
THAC0). Unfortunately, he rolls a 1 and fails. He will remain grappled no matter what
the bugbears roll.
<P></P>
The bugbears try to overbear again; because Anada is grappled, he gets no
attacks of opportunity and the bugbears do not have to make an attack roll. The
bugbears win the opposed Strength roll, knocking Anada to the floor again.
<P></P>
By this time, two more bugbears arrive on the scene. The bugbears attempt to
pin Anada during the next round and the new bugbears join the pile. They have a
+8 bonus and handily win the opposed Strength roll. All of Anada’s limbs are
pinned.
<P></P>
The next round, they attempt to maintain the pin and succeed again. All of
Anada’s limbs have been pinned for two consecutive rounds, and the bugbears have
him under control. Four bugbears pull Anada’s arms and lock them behind his back
while the fifth bugbear ties them together (a manipulation). Anada suffers
1d2+10 points of damage from the manhandling (because the bugbears’ effective
Strength score is 22).
<P></P>
The five bugbears quickly haul their bound captive back to his cell, where
they bind him even more securely.
