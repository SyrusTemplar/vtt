<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Each school lies in opposition to one to three of the
existing schools of magic. The specialist of the new school will be
unable to learn spells from the schools that lie in opposition to his school.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The first step in determining oppositional schools is
to decide which existing school most closely resembles the new
school. In some cases, this is obvious; for instance, our new school
of metamorphics is most like the school of alteration. For less
obvious cases, you can eliminate most of the possibilities by
recalling which type of magic your new school is derived from (see
the </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="DD06095.htm">Types
of Magic</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> section above). A new
school will most closely resemble an existing school derived from the
same type of magic (see </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="DD06117.htm">Table
4</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">); for instance, if your new
school produces Creation effects, it most closely resembles either
the school of illusion or invocation/evocation. Once the choices have
been narrowed to two or three schools, it should be easy to pick the
school most like your new school. If necessary, try comparing your
new spells to the existing spells in the<I> Player's Handbook</I> .</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">When you've decided which existing school most closely
resembles your new school, consult the opposition diagram (Diagram
1). The school that lies directly opposite this school is the
oppositional school. The school of metamorphics most closely
resembles the school of alteration. The school directly across from
alteration on Diagram 1 is abjuration. Therefore, abjuration is the
school that is in opposition to metamorphics.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">One to three oppositional schools may be assigned to a
new school. If the new school is relatively weak (the weak school of
greater divination has only a single oppositional school), only one
opposition school may be needed. If your new school is relatively
powerful, it is appropriate to assign it as many as three
oppositional schools.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Look again at Diagram 1. The schools on either side of
the oppositional school are also options for oppositional schools.
For instance, additional oppositional schools for illusion are
invocation/evocation and abjuration. If it's appropriate for your
school to have three oppositional schools, choose these three.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Most likely, your new school will be neither extremely
weak nor extremely powerful. In this case, consider giving it two
oppositional schools. One should be the initial oppositional school,
and the other can be either of the adjacent schools. To decide
between the adjacent schools, choose randomly or choose the one that
seems less compatible with your new school.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">We must choose the oppositional schools for our new
school of metamorphics. Since it is neither exceptionally weak or
powerful, we will assign it two oppositional schools.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">We decided previously that the school of metamorphics
most closely resembles the school of alteration. According to Diagram
1, the oppositional school of alteration is abjuration; therefore,
the oppositional school of metamorphics is also abjuration.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">According to Diagram 1, the adjacent oppositional
schools for abjuration-- and likewise, for metamorphics-- are conjuration/summoning
and necromancy. We need to choose one of them for our other
oppositional school. Either conjuration/summoning or necromancy would
be appropriate, but since the school of alteration already has
abjuration and necromancy for its oppositional schools, we will
choose the other combination. Therefore, the opposition schools for
metamorphics are abjuration and conjuration/summoning.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Admittedly, the choice of the second and third
oppositional schools is somewhat arbitrary, but remember that we not
only strive for balance, but also for schools with unique advantages
and restrictions. The DM always has the option to invent a rationale
for the existence of specific oppositional schools. For instance, the
energies employed by conjuration/summoning and abjuration magic might
induce agonizing headaches in a transfigurist, making it impossible
for him to learn spells from those schools</FONT></P>
