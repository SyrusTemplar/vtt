<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Oil of Etherealness:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This potion is actually a light oil that is applied externally to clothes and
exposed flesh, conferring etherealness. In the ethereal state, the individual
can pass through solid objects in any direction—sideways, upward, downward—or to
different planes. The individual cannot touch non-ethereal objects.
<P></P>
The oil takes effect three rounds after application, and it lasts for 4 + 1d4
turns unless removed with a weak acidic solution prior to the expiration of its
normal effective duration. It can be applied to objects as well as creatures.
One potion is sufficient to anoint a normal human and such gear as he typically
carries (two or three weapons, garments, armor, shield, and miscellaneous
gear). Ethereal individuals are invisible.
