<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Rod of Beguiling:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This rod enables its possessor to radiate an emotional and mental wave of
fellow feeling to all creatures with any Intelligence whatsoever (1 or higher
Intelligence). The rod causes all such creatures within a 20-foot radius of the
device to regard the wielder as their comrade, friend, or mentor (no saving throw).
<P></P>
The beguiled creatures will love and respect the rod wielder. They will
listen, trust, and obey him, insofar as communication is possible and instructions
given don't consign the beguilded to needless injury or destruction or go against
their nature or alignment. Each charge of the rod beguiles for one turn. It
can be recharged.
