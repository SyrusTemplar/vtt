   Dual-classed characters must be human. A dual class ranger may be of any
character kit, presuming the DM allows it in his campaign.
<P></P>
   To change from a ranger to another class, the ranger must have a minimum score
of 15 in Strength, Dexterity, and Wisdom. He must have a score of 17 or better
in the prime requisites of the new class.
<P></P>
   If a character from another class wants to switch to a ranger, he must have a
minimum score of 15 in his prime requisites and a score of 17 or better in
Strength, Dexterity, and Wisdom.
