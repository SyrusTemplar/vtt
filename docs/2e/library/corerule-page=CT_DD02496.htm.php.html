In single-weapon style, the character wields a one-handed weapon and leaves
his off-hand empty. There are some disadvantages to this style, in that the
character is shorting himself the protection of a shield or the extra offense of a
secondary weapon. However, single-weapon style <I>does </I>leave the character with a hand free for using magical items, grabbing, or
punching an opponent.
<P></P>
If the single-weapon character makes an off-hand attack, such as a punch or
grab, he’s considered to be fighting with two weapons. His primary weapon suffers
a –2 penalty to attack rolls and his secondary attacks suffer a –4 penalty to
hit. These penalties are offset by the character’s reaction adjustment for his
Dexterity score.
<P></P>
All player characters, regardless of class, know the single-weapon fighting
style.
