Another characteristic of spells is their sensory signature, or just how
noticeable the effects of the spell are. A <I>lightning bolt </I>includes a blinding flash of light and a deafening clap of thunder; clearly,
it is much more noticeable than a <I>shocking grasp </I>or an <I>unseen servant</I>. Many spell effects are completely undetectable; for example, a <I>charm person, polymorph self</I>, or <I>feeblemind </I>spell may wreak all kinds of havoc with the subject, but outside observers
can’t see, smell, or hear anything when the spell is cast that lets them know that
magic was just employed. Sensory effects fall into (naturally) five major
categories: sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste.

subject have a visual sensory signature. Any creature close enough to see the
effect will be aware of the fact that a spell has been cast.

even if it’s a weird hum, buzz, or <I>ZOTTT! </I>as the magic affects its target. A few spells have particularly noticeable
audible signatures, such as <I>lightning bolt, shout</I>, and other such deadly enchantments. Very few spells have an audible
signature without some form of visual signature as well.

olfactory signatures behind, particularly spells that start fires. The pungent fumes
of a <I>pyrotechnics </I>or <I>incendiary cloud </I>spell may easily be the first thing an observer notices, even before he sees
the smoke.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Touch and Taste: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Usually, if a character’s close enough to notice a spell’s effect by these
methods, he’s already quite aware of the fact that magic has been used against
him. However, in some cases, this might be a character’s only way to detect a
spell. For example, a character who has been magically <I>blinded </I>and <I>deafened </I>would still feel the warmth of a distant <I>fireball </I>on his face or feel the tremors caused by a priest’s <I>earthquake</I>.
