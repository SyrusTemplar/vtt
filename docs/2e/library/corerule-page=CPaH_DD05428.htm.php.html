   Even when a paladin isn't fulfilling an edict, waging war, or embarking on a
quest, he still has plenty to keep him busy. Some common activities are
described below. Of course, not all paladins engage in all of these activities. A
Chevalier probably spends more time enforcing laws than an Errant. A Votary may set
aside several days a week to recruit new members to his church, whereas
Divinates may be forbidden by their faith to engage in <I>any</I> type of proselytizing.
<P></P>
   Although neither the player nor the DM is obliged to keep track of a paladin's
activities between campaigns, some of his routine duties may lead to
adventures. While on a reconnaissance patrol, the paladin might discover a meeting of
ogres, preparing to join forces to storm the king's stronghold. A paladin's
desire to improve his riding skills could lead to a search for a legendary horseman.
A proselytizing expedition may stir up trouble with a rival church. Victory at
a tournament could result in the defeated opponent seeking a deadly revenge.

<P></P>
<P></P>
   Obliged to eliminate evil, a paladin is always on the lookout for lawbreakers,
intervening whenever he sees a crime in progress. Overtly evil acts often meet
with swift retribution; the paladin simply slays the culprit outright. In
societies where even the vilest crimes must be tried in a court of law, paladins
refrain from taking justice into their own hands, instead turning the suspect
over to the proper authorities for prosecution.
<P></P>
   Law enforcement involves more than thwarting criminals. A paladin breaks up
rowdy crowds before riots ensue and escorts drunks to their homes. She disposes
of illegal weapons and other contraband. She intercepts spooked horses, treats
accident victims, and reunites lost children with their parents. She may even
clean up illegally dumped trash.
<P></P>
   While most paladins enforce the law as a matter of principle, some are
formally deputized by their lieges to serve as local police. Deputized paladins are
assigned regular patrol hours, usually after dark when most crimes occur. The
paladins patrol designated areas on foot or horseback, monitoring strangers,
questioning suspicious characters, and keeping an eye out for trouble. They may be
authorized to make arrests, levy fines, or even perform on-the-spot executions.
Deputized paladins usually have jurisdiction only within the borders of their
community or kingdom, though they may demand extradition of wanted criminals who
have sought refuge in other lands.

<P></P>
<P></P>
   A paladin takes advantage of every opportunity to encourage and promote
ethical behavior. He reinforces lawful good behavior by acknowledging the good deeds
of ordinary citizens, expressing his appreciation in private meetings or public
ceremonies. He gives lectures, participates in debates, and organizes
discussion groups, all meant to persuade others of the benefits of a moral life. He
presents himself as a role model to youngsters, dazzling them with stories of his
exploits and expounding on the glories of a career spent in service to the
government or church. A paladin also makes himself available for counseling,
offering advice to the troubled and guidance to the confused.

<P></P>
<P></P>
   A paladin continuously trains his mind and body, focusing on military skills.
He jousts against stuffed dummies using a technique called <I>quintain</I> (see the illustration on page 92). He duels against multiple opponents with
swords wrapped in cloth. He familiarizes himself with all types of weapons,
including those improvised from rocks, branches, and other natural items; with
practice, a paladin can construct a usable sling from a length of cloth and a
leather strip in a matter of minutes.
<P></P>
   Most paladins undergo a daily routine of physical exercise. Wearing full
armor, a paladin may hike up a mountainside while carrying a sheep or calf. With a
weight secured to his back, he may attempt to swim the length of a lake. He
scales walls, climbs ropes, wrestles other warriors, and stages cross-country races.
<P></P>
   His regimen also includes mental exercise. He may memorize lengthy passages
from sacred scriptures or translate poetry into different languages. He may
dissect animal cadavers to study anatomy or raise a garden to learn botany. A
friendly ranger may teach him how to track animal; an experienced seaman may teach
him how to navigate a ship.

<P></P>
<P></P>
   A paladin maintains her equipment in first-class condition. She keeps her
shield and armor polished and free of corrosion. Dents are tapped out, scratches
are buffed clean, tarnishes are refinished. Blades are straightened, hardened by
fire, then resharpened on grindstones. Clothing, too, receives meticulous
attention. A paladin usually hand-washes her garments in cold water, squeezing
(rather than wringing) them out before hanging them in the sun to dry. She soaks her
undergarments and shirts in a barrel filled with soda and wood ash, then
pounds them on a rock. Coats and capes may be freshened with steam by placing them
in an enclosed room containing a pot of boiling water. Saddles, boots, belts,
and other leather items must be oiled and polished.

<P></P>
<P></P>
   A paladin's impeccable manners, striking appearance, and sterling reputation
makes him a highly desirable guest for banquets, receptions, and other formal
functions. Some accept as many invitations as their schedules allow, particularly
those from colleagues and dignitaries. Refusal might be interpreted as an
insult.
<P></P>
   Often, his attendance amounts to little more than window dressing, his
superiors taking advantage of the occasion to display him like a trophy. A paladin
endures these events with grace, retelling his war stories to pampered lords and
ladies while listening to their dreary comments.
<P></P>
   A paladin often represents his superiors at functions in other lands. He gives
eulogies at funerals and witnesses christenings. He attends the weddings,
birthday parties, and confirmation ceremonies of foreign aristocrats. He may also
deliver documents and messages that are too important to trust to heralds.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
   Even when not at war, a paladin with military responsibilities has a lot to
do. If occupying a stronghold, he must prepare for enemy attacks by fortifying
the walls with metal braces, widening moats, and digging trenches. Ample supplies
of food, water, ammunition, and medicine must be secured. He may conduct
drills to ensure that his troops respond swiftly and in a coordinated fashion to
surprise assaults. He consults with engineers and tacticians to determine which
sides of the stronghold are most vulnerable. He rehearses bowmen to fire arrows
blindly, in case of an attack made under cover of fog or during a moonless night.
<P></P>
   In the field, the paladin conducts reconnaissance patrols into enemy territory
to gather information. He leads his troops on practice exercises to get them
used to moving through swamps, deserts, and other hostile terrain. He may also
conduct military experiments with animals, using cooperative elephants as pack
animals, trained banderlogs as infantrymen, and <I>charmed</I> bulettes as assault weapons.

<P></P>
<P></P>
   A tournament a series of formal games that gives paladins and other warriors
the chance to practice their combat skills, impress the citizenry (therby
boosting their reputation), and perhaps even earn a little money. Though designed as
entertainment, tournaments are not without risk. A bad performance may cost the
paladin her honor. A disastrous performance may cost her life.
<P></P>
   Rulers and affluent landowners sponsor tournaments to amuse their colleagues
and raise community morale. Tournaments also give them the chance to flaunt
their wealth in a socially acceptable manner. Messengers and heralds are hired to
spread the word about upcoming tournaments, which often attract participants
from hundreds of miles away.
<P></P>
   A carnival-like atmosphere prevails on the day of a tournament. Colorful
banners flutter over sprawling bleachers packed with spectators. Soldiers stroll the
grounds in gleaming armor. The aroma of roast pork and steaming vegetables
wafts through the air. Merchants peddle paladin dolls and other gaudy mementos.
Grandmothers gossip, children frolic, and gamblers place discrete wagers.
<P></P>
   Tournament events include sword duels, archery contests, and—always of primary
interest—jousting matches. In a typical joust, two paladins mount their horses
on opposite ends of an open field, then raise their shields and lances. On a
trumpet blast from the referee, they charge. Each attempts to dislodge the other
from his horse. If neither succeeds, they return to their starting positions
and try again. The winner faces another opponent in the next round. Whoever
fells the most opponents during the day wins the contest.
<P></P>
   Victory brings honor to both the paladin and the liege he represents. The
paladin may also win a modest prize. Defeat, however, means disgrace, and a
deliberately poor performance is considered an ethos violation. If the paladin has
chosen a lady or other person to champion, victory ensures a favorable impression
(modify the reaction roll by at least +1). Defeat brings humiliation, and the
championed person may shun the paladin forever after (modify the reaction roll
by at least –1; in any case, the reaction won't be better than Indifferent). If
a poor performance insults the championed person, this might be considered an
ethos violation.
<P></P>
   Though contestants use blunted lances and are advised to behave like
gentlemen, jousts often result in serious and sometimes fatal damage. Even a blunted
lance can strike a deadly blow, particularly when delivered by a paladin on a war
horse charging at top speed. Occasionally, a paladin knocked from his mount
will catch his spur in a stirrup; the confused mount may drag the hapless paladin
to his death. A losing contestant may not take defeat gracefully, attacking the
winner with a sword or club. Such attacks have been known to trigger
full-scale riots, resulting in dozens of casualties before soldiers manage to disperse
the crowd.
