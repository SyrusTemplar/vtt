<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Harp of Discord:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This harp appears normal in all respects. However, when played, the harp emits
painful and discordant tones 50% of the time. The remaining 50% of the time it
acts as a <I>harp of charming.</I> When discordant, the music has the effect of automatically enraging all those
within 30 feet. Those enraged will attack the musicians 50% of the time or the
nearest other target the remaining 50% of the time. The harpist is not
affected by this frenzy unless he is being attacked. The frenzy lasts for 1d4 + 1
rounds after the music stops.
