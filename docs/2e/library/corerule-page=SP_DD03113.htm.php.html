<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Music/Instrument: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The character with this trait has the manual dexterity and musical sensibility
to skillfully operate an instrument such as a harp, flute, lyre, drum, etc.
While the trait does not convey the knowledge of how to play any instrument—that
must come from a proficiency—this inherent talent assures that the character
may quite possibly rise to a significant level of fame for his musical
performances. The character can more readily learn to play musical instruments as note in
the musical instrument proficiency description.
