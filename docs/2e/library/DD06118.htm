The final step in designing a new school is creating a unique ethos. This step
is optional, but it adds color to the school and makes it more interesting for
the players.
<P></P>
An ethos also serves as a springboard for determining the personality of
specialist characters. An ethos can be anything from a simple outline to a detailed
profile. Following are some questions to consider when designing an ethos for a
new school.
<P></P>
<I>Do the specialists of the school adhere to any particular philosophy?</I> <I>Do they share any particular goals?</I> Such philosophies and goals are often derived from the nature of the magic
studied by the specialist. For instance, specialists from the school of
metamorphics study spells dealing with change. Continual exposure to the transience of
all things might lead transfigurists to be skeptical about the existence of
absolutes--a transfigurist, then, might believe that concepts such as &quot;right&quot; and
&quot;wrong&quot; are relative to specific situations.
<P></P>
<I>Are evil-aligned characters more drawn to this school than good-aligned
characters (or vice versa)?</I> In most cases, wizards of all alignments can be specialists in any school,
but a new school might discourage certain alignments and encourage others.
Likewise, certain magical academies might accept students of specific alignments
only.
<P></P>
If a school does not promote harm to any living creature, or promotes healing,
safety, comfort, or compassion, then it probably excludes evil alignments. If
it promotes cruelty or self-interest, the school probably excludes good
alignments. If a school promotes no particular philosophy, it probably includes
specialists of all alignments.
<P></P>
If a school advocates logical thinking and adherence to strict behavioral
norms, and discourages excessive self-expression, it probably leans toward lawful
alignments. If it encourages creative thinking, freedom of expression, and
spontaneous actions, it leans toward chaotic alignments (this is particularly true
if it also encourages defiance of written laws to achieve individual goals). If
the school takes no particular position on the specialist's relationship with
his culture and society, it probably includes lawful, neutral, and chaotic
specialists. (The school of metamorphics takes no particular positions on these
issues, therefore it is open to specialists of all alignments. Note that this
attitude about alignments is also consistent with the school's general philosophy of
skepticism about absolutes described above.)
<P></P>
<I>Are any particular personality types drawn to the study of this school? Do
they tend to share any common eccentricities? Common likes or dislikes? Would
anything about your new school tend to discourage certain types of people or
attract others?</I> The school of metamorphics attracts students with a natural interest in the
world around them. Since its spells change one thing into another, most students
will be interested in how things work and how things are put together-- in
short, metamorphics students are analytical, curious, and creative.
<P></P>
<I>What's the relationship of the specialist to other members of his party?</I> Usually, the type of spells available to a specialist will suggest his role
in the campaign. If the specialist has a lot of offensive spells, he will likely
be on the front lines when the party goes to battle. A specialist with a lot
of defensive or reconnaissance spells might be a good spy or investigator.
Although we haven't yet devised many spells for our transfigurists, it looks like
neither offensive nor defensive spells will predominate. Therefore, it seems
likely that a transfigurist will leave the bulk of the fighting to others in his
party.
<P></P>
<I>Do specialists of this school tend to have a lot of friends? Are they likely
to have spouses and families?</I> This depends on the specialist's philosophy, goals, and personality. Unless
the specialist is extreme in one of these areas-- for instance, if he is
obsessive about the study of magic, or if his field is considered repulsive or
frightening (such as the school of necromancy)-- he is likely to have an average
number of friends and an average chance at a successful marriage. (Since
transfigurists have no extreme traits, we will assume that they have a fair number of
friends and are as likely as anyone to marry and raise a family. )
<P></P>
<I>Where do these specialists prefer to live?</I> As mentioned previously, certain schools tend to attract certain types of
people. If a school's specialists tend to be outgoing and affable, they probably
prefer to live in an urban area. If they're brooding and anti-social, or if
they're conducting potentially dangerous research, they probably live in an
isolated area. Usually, a specific location won't suggest itself-- specialists tend to
live just about anywhere. We will make this the case with transfigurists.
<P></P>
<I>How do the specialists spend most of their time?</I> Reclusive types will stay close to home, usually lost in research, reading,
or writing. Curious types are more inclined to explore the world, eager to meet
people and experience new situations. In most cases, there will not be obvious
pastimes applicable to all specialists of a school. This will be the case with
transfigurists. They spend some of their time doing research at home and a fair
amount of time out in the world exploring and socializing.
<P></P>
<I>How do the specialists typically earn a living?</I> Common occupations for wizards include teaching, counseling, researching, and
advising. However, the spells available to a particular specialist might
suggest additional careers. The metamorphics spells do not suggest any particular
occupation, so transfigurists probably pursue the common wizard occupations.
