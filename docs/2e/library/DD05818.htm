<I>Description:</I> A Smuggler is a specialist in the illicit movement of goods, either goods
that are themselves illegal (e.g., stolen) or whose movement is illegal (in some
countries, for example, it may be illegal to move gold bullion; or a Smuggler
might secretly move cargo to avoid paying taxes on it). The Smuggler needs a host
of practical skills to evade authorities, as well as connections in diverse
places to acquire and unload his merchandise on the black market.
<P></P>
<I>Role:</I> The Smuggler plays a vital role in the underworld, moving goods from place to
place. Without the Smuggler, Fences could only sell to local buyers, which
would mean they couldn't deal in exceptionally valuable goods. This would greatly
cut the profitability of theft. Guilds themselves might not even be able to
function, at least not on a large scale.
<P></P>
There are two general methods of protecting contraband from discovery: Either
you hide the goods within the transportation, or you hide the means of
transportation itself. An example of the former would be a wagon or boat built with a
false floor, beneath which the cargo is hidden. Hidden transportation would
include sneaking oneself over the city wall late at night, with a pack full of
stolen loot to be taken to a distant Fence; or, perhaps, a simple boat traveling
late at night.
<P></P>
Plans for hidden transportation may become elaborate. The trick is to be small
and fast. Small makes it more difficult to find you; fast makes it likely that
you can get through or, at least, get away, even if you are discovered.
Sometimes the best smuggling routes go through treacherous territory or difficult
terrain. This means that a Smuggler must be flexible. For instance, he may arrange
to bring a canoe or even smaller craft to traverse a swamp or area of many
small lakes and streams, portaging when necessary and leaving the canoe behind
(and hidden, of course) when he has passed the natural obstacles.
<P></P>
If the Smugglers will pass through dangerous territory (plagued by bandits,
humanoids or monsters, for instance), it is best to work out some means of
protection: Either bring along a couple of thugs or mercenaries for the difficult
parts, or pay &quot;protection money&quot; to the dangerous parties. Most bandits or
humanoids, and even intelligent monsters, would be perfectly happy to let Smugglers
through in return for a cut of their merchandise.
<P></P>
Or they may tell the Smugglers that they can pass safely through, and then
renege on the deal.
<P></P>
For such a situation, it is best for the Smuggler to have some powerful muscle
behind him?like a guild. A great many Smugglers are part of guilds. Guilds
that operate in more than one urban center, or in the countryside, usually employ
a number of Smugglers just to move people and items within their own networks.
They may also have Smugglers who specialize in dealing with other guilds; such
Smugglers should have a high Charisma, because they must serve as diplomats as
well as businessmen. Finally, there are freelance Smugglers. They may operate
between guilds, between guilds and freelance fences, or, on rare occasion,
solely among freelance fences.
<P></P>
Remember that a Smuggler operates between fences; he rarely, if ever, deals
directly with thieves or non-&quot;wholesale&quot; customers. The fence or guild works out
deals with prospective buyer fences, and then hires the Smuggler to make the
delivery.

<I>Secondary Skills:</I> Farmer, Fisher, Forester, Gambler, Groom, Hunter, Jeweler, Navigator, Sailor,
Teamster/Freighter, Trader/Barterer, Trapper/Furrier.
<P></P>
<I>Weapon Proficiencies: </I>Smugglers have the normal range of weapons open to thieves, and are not
required to take proficiences with any in particular.
<P></P>
<I>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</I> Required: None. Recommended: Alertness, Animal Handling/Training, Animal
Noise, Appraising, Boating, Direction Sense, Disguise, Fast-talking, Forgery,
Gather Intelligence, Navigation, Observation, Rope Use, Seamanship, Swimming.
<P></P>
<I>Skill Progression:</I> Detecting noise is probably the most useful of the traditional thieves'
skills for the Smuggler. After that, hiding in shadows and silent movement probably
see a lot of use. Pickpocketing would be least utilized in smuggling.
<P></P>
<I>Equipment:</I> Two items are essential to the Smuggler's vocation: means of transportation,
and means of protecting the contraband from discovery.
<P></P>
Transportation is usually very basic: wagon or horse for land, boat for water,
and so forth. More elaborate smuggling plans in the fantasy setting may
include air transportation?imagine a Smuggler who secrets stolen gems out of a city,
late on moonless nights, by griffon!
<P></P>
Items from the &quot;Evasions&quot; section of the chapter on equipment (p. 90) are of
great use to the Smuggler. Marbles (if the surface is right) or caltrops can do
much to hamper pursuers, and aniseed or dog pepper can throw dogs off the trail.
<P></P>
<I>Special Benefits:</I> Smugglers must be exceptionally alert; they therefore get a +1 bonus to their
surprise roll.
<P></P>
<I>Special Hindrances:</I> None.
<P></P>
<I>Races:</I> While demihumans are not prohibited from being smugglers, there are few that
have any reason to be. Any player who wishes to have a demi-human smuggler
should be sure to detail his character background so as to justify the kit.
