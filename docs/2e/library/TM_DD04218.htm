This spell allows a wizard to create a quasi-real, vulturelike creature. The
flying steed can carry the caster and one other person per three levels of the
wizard's experience (four at 12th level, five at 15th, etc.). All passengers
must be specifically named during the casting.
<P></P>
The spectral steed looks like a huge, skeletal vulture with tattered wings. As
it flies, it utters hideous screeches that echo through the sky. The spectral
steed flies at a movement rate of 4 per level of the caster, to a maximum
movement rate of 48. It appears with a bit and bridle, plus one saddle per passenger.
<P></P>
All normal animals shun the spectral steed and only monsters will attack it.
The mount has AC 2 and 10 hit points plus 1 hit point per level of the caster.
If it loses all of its hit points, the spectral steed disappears. It has no
attack mode.
<P></P>
The material component is a hollow bone from a vulture's wing, which must be
carved into a whistle and blown when the spell is cast.
