Upon completion of this long and highly-versatile incantation, the caster
permanently transfers a creature-s life force (even his or her own) into a
specially fabricated item, a magical receptacle, or the body of another individual.
Once the mental transfer has been completed, the recipient-s body falls into a
cataleptic state, and remains in a death-like trance or coma for 2?7 days. Unless
the subject-s life force is magically reunited with the body during that time
period, his or her body dies, and the life force remains permanently trapped
within the physical object or new body.
<P></P>
While in the physical receptacle, the recipient may perform any action
permitted by the new form. In an item such as a ring or a sword, the subject may
communicate with the user when the receptacle is held or worn properly. The extent
of communication depends on the subject-s intelligence:

Individuals of low or average intelligence cannot communicate, and those of
above-average intelligence can communicate using a primitive form of empathy
(usually limited to a throb or tingle of varying intensity). At the discretion of
the DM, the life force might animate a specially prepared statue or golem,
perhaps even enabling the recipient to employ any memorized spells.
<P></P>
<I>Life force transfer</I> is sometimes the final step in the manufacture of a powerful magical item or
minor artifact (usually a sword). In this process, a victim-s life force is
transferred into a magical item (unless he or she saves vs. death magic at ?4),
which is finally sealed with a <I>permanency</I>.
<P></P>
In such an enchantment, the recipient-s body is frequently destroyed afterward
by the caster, forever trapping the victim-s life force in the item (unless
the <I>permanency</I> is first reversed and a new body prepared using a <I>clone</I>, <I>wish</I>, or similar means). If the item is destroyed while the recipient-s life force
is in it, the creature may regain its body by making a system shock roll if it
lies within 1 mile per level of the original caster; otherwise, the subject-s
life force dissipates, and the creature dies.
<P></P>
Sometimes, a wizard may employ this spell as a final measure to protect his or
her own life. In this version, the entire incantation and receptacle are
prepared and cast beforehand, but only the final syllable of the spell is left
unfinished. The wizard may pronounce this short (single segment) syllable at any
later time, casting his or her life force into the receptacle-providing that it
lies within range. Obviously, this strategy only works if the receptacle is kept
close to the wizard at all times. Furthermore, the wizard usually must leave
behind clues or encrypted instructions so that his or her allies may later
reverse the spell and restore the wizard to his or her normal state, whatever that
may be. While the spell is in its unfinished state, the wizard cannot learn a new
8th-level spell to replace it. Aside from this limitation, however, the caster
remains unaffected by the pending spell.
<P></P>
Less scrupulous wizards may use this rite to permanently transfer the
recipient-s life force (often their own) into the body of a younger individual, thereby
extending their own existence. The victim is entitled to a saving throw vs.
death magic with a ?4 penalty to resist the effects. If failed, the subject-s
life force departs (resulting in the death of the victim), and the recipient-s
life force takes permanent possession of the victim-s body. If the saving throw is
successful, the spell fails without any ill effect to either the victim or
recipient (though it may be recast at a later date). Thus, an ancient necromancer
may transfer his or her life force into the body of a vigorous, younger person,
thereby gaining all of the victim-s physical attributes, manual skills, hit
points, and extended life span.
<P></P>
The spell requires either an expertly-crafted item or any living human,
demihuman, or humanoid (preferably young and healthy) to house the subject-s life
force. The remaining material components include a scroll inscribed with special
rare inks and a massive, blood red garnet (worth 5,000 gp or more). The exact
nature of any physical receptacle should be decided by the DM, but it must be of
quality suitable for enchantment. The garnet (but not the scroll) is consumed
in the casting. This spell cannot be dispelled normally (even in its -pending?
state). If the receptacle was not sealed with a<I> permanency</I>, then the subject-s life force may be driven out with <I>spirit release</I> or <I>dispel evil</I> (in the event of a permanent magical receptacle, the item-s <I>permanency</I> must be first overcome with <I>dispel magic</I>).
<P></P>
In rare cases, to be adjudicated by the DM, the life force of the victim does
not depart from the body, but coexists in his or her body with that of the
recipient or -intruder.? Such a life force may be able to take control of the
survivor-use the control rules for the <I>magic jar</I> spell to determine this. As before, the -intruder? life force can only be
ejected by casting <I>spirit release</I> or <I>dispel evil</I> (or a full <I>wish</I>). Otherwise, at the discretion of the DM, the life force of the -intruder?
merges with that of the victim, diluting the recipient-s personality, alignment,
and possibly sanity, as well.
<P></P>
The reverse of this spell, <I>revoke life force transfer</I>, requires the original scroll (the one used in the <I>life force transfer</I> spell to be revoked), the construct, and the body of the recipient. Providing
that the spell is cast before the body physically dies (within 2?7 days of the
original separation), the reversal process requires a system shock roll in
order to be successful. If failed (or if the body has already perished), the newly
released life force dissipates, and the subject dies.
