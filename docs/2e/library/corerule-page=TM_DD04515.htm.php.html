<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Tapestry of Disease Warding:</B> This is a 3-foot-square cotton tapestry bearing the image of a rainbow. When
hung in a house or other building (10,000 square feet or less), it protects the
occupants from nonmagical diseases. It has no effect on persons already
suffering from diseases, but protects healthy characters from contracting contagious
diseases ranging from common colds to deadly plagues. The tapestry offers no
protection against any disease caused by magic or of a magical nature.
<P></P>
The <I>tapestry of disease warding</I> is subject to rips, fire, and other damage that could be sustained by a
normal tapestry, although it is allowed a saving throw. Its magic is permanent only
as long as it remains intact. The tapestry may be moved to a new location, but
has no effect outdoors.
