?? The defining characteristic, a single word that summarizes a character's
personality, describes the essential nature of the character and how he comes across
to others. A character's personality comprises many elements, but the defining
characteristic is the dominant trait from which all other personality
components arise. A defining characteristic can be chosen for paladins (or any other
character, for that matter). Several possibilities listed below should get you
started.
<P></P>
?? How to choose a defining characteristic? There's no best way, but you'll know
you're on the right track if a particular characteristic fits your conception
of the character. For instance, if you picture your paladin charging boldly into
battle, slaughtering his enemies without remorse, his defining characteristic
could be Vengeful. If you see him as withdrawn and brooding, he might be
Tormented. The descriptions below are intentionally vague to encourage personal
interpretation.
<P></P>
?? You may also select secondary traits to compliment the defining
characteristic. Each entry below lists a number of options. Choose one or two that appeal to
you, or make up your own. Any secondary traits are fine, so long as they don't
contradict the defining characteristic; a Vengeful paladin might be Brutal but
he's unlikely to be Shy.
<P></P>
?? Defining characteristics work with some kits better than others. Each entry
lists a few suggestions, but don't feel restricted by them. Use any defining
characteristic with any kit that feels right to you. You can also mix and match the
various corollary characteristics, or ignore them altogether.
<P></P>
?? Previous volumes in the <I>Complete Handbook</I> series include lists of archetypes drawn from literature, film, and other
fictional and mythological sources. Many of these archetypes can be adapted to
paladin characters. <I>The Complete Bard's Handbook</I> features a series of tables to determine personality traits randomly for
bards or any other character.

<P></P>
<B>Aggressive</B>
<P></P>
?? The aggressive paladin speaks with his sword. Uneasy in social situations and
impatient with negotiation, he is most comfortable on the battlefield. He
relishes combat, particularly hand-to-hand encounters with enemies formidable enough
to put up a good fight. A forceful personality who often wears his emotions on
his sleeve, he makes a spirited companion and a dangerous opponent.
<P></P>
<I>?? Secondary Traits:</I> Heroic, impulsive, haughty, wise-cracking, abrasive, inspiring.
<P></P>
?? <I>Suggested Kits:</I> Chevalier, Inquisitor, Militarist, Wyrmslayer.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Cynical</B>
<P></P>
?? While as devoted to her ethos as any other paladin, the cynical paladin sees
the pursuit of justice as admirable but ultimately futile. Greed, selfishness,
and hatred seem to predominate in the world. Compassion and selflessness are
hard to find. Advocates of good are hopelessly outnumbered. The cynical paladin
fights tirelessly for her principles, but can't shake the feeling that her work
may be in vain. To her, optimism is touching but naive, despondency a perfectly
understandable reaction to a callous world.
<P></P>
?? <I>Secondary Traits:</I> Angry, quick-witted, reflective, soft-hearted, brooding, helpful.
<P></P>
?? <I>Suggested Kits:</I> Expatriate, Ghosthunter, Votary, Wyrmslayer.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Genteel</B>
<P></P>
?? The genteel paladin is a man of taste, more at home at a formal ball than a
bloody battlefield. While his military skills are has finely honed as those of
any paladin, he views combat as an unpleasant necessity; enemies should be
dispatched as quickly as possible, preferably with flair and style. He owns the
finest clothes and equipment he can afford, and spends as much time on personal
grooming as others do practicing weapon skills. He is preoccupied with courtly
etiquette and elegant living, looking forward to the day when he can retire to his
stronghold and live out the remainder of his life as a proper gentleman.
<P></P>
?? <I>Secondary Traits:</I> Conceited, prudish, romantic, intellectual, precise, opinionated.
<P></P>
?? <I>Suggested Kits: </I>Chevalier, Envoy, Equerry, Squire.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Inquisitive</B>
<P></P>
?? The inquisitive paladin has an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Outgoing and
amiable, his interests know no limits; he's as fascinated by the rice-growing
techniques of elven farmers as the mating rituals of ankhegs. His curiosity
often frustrates his companions, who may be eager to resume their travels while he
lingers behind, discussing doctrine with a local priest or engrossed by a
newborn bluebird pecking its way from its shell.
<P></P>
?? <I>Secondary Traits:</I> Carefree, shallow, talkative, wise, distracted, warm, studious.
<P></P>
?? <I>Suggested Kits:</I> Divinate, Envoy, Errant, Squire.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Optimistic</B>
<P></P>
?? Relentlessly cheerful and unflaggingly confident, the optimistic paladin could
not imagine a better life for herself. She is utterly convinced of the
righteousness of her cause, and looks forward to each day as a new opportunity to
bring more goodness into the world. She delights in the companionship of others.
Her comrades find her a source of inspiration and a beacon of hope in times of
despair.
<P></P>
?? <I>Secondary Traits:</I> Nurturing, compassionate, extroverted, compliant, humorous, relaxed, warm.
<P></P>
?? <I>Suggested Kits:</I> Errant, Inquisitor, Skyrider, Squire.
<P></P>
<B>
<P></P>
Philosophic</B>
<P></P>
?? The philosophic paladin is drawn to the pleasures of the mind, preferring a
poetry reading to a jousting match, a science text to a glass of fine wine. He
enjoys scholarly debates on religion and history, and is fascinated by new
cultures. His aptitude for intellectual analysis makes him an excellent tactician and
valued advisor. Rarely impulsive, his actions are measured and deliberate,
born of logic rather than emotion.
<P></P>
?? <I>Secondary Traits:</I> Thoughtful, cold, hesitant, dispassionate, meticulous, curious.
<P></P>
?? <I>Suggested Kits:</I> Chevalier, Divinate, Errant, Medician.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Prudent</B>
<P></P>
?? The prudent paladin acts with deliberation and foresight, believing that
fortune smiles on the cautious. He weighs his words before speaking and is loathe to
undertake a mission without careful planning. He is impressed by logic,
unmoved by emotion. His rational, dispassionate approach to problem-solving makes him
a superb tactician and arbitrator, though some find him cold, even
calculating. His level head tempers his private affairs; he manages his stronghold well,
avoids debt, and rarely succumbs to temptation.
<P></P>
<I>?? Secondary Traits:</I> Shrewd, insightful, unfriendly, arrogant, keen-witted, reflective.
<P></P>
<I>?? Suggested Kits:</I> Ghosthunter, Inquisitor, Militarist, Wyrmslayer.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Secretive</B>
<P></P>
?? For reasons of his own, the secretive paladin reveals little about his
background, motivations, or personality, even to his closest companions. He may wear a
hood or visor at all times to conceal his features, dress in black or other
dark colors, and cover or remove any heraldic symbols from his equipment. He
keeps to himself, seldom speaking unless absolutely necessary; he may even wear a
scarf around his mouth to muffle his voice. Though he faithfully fulfills his
obligations to his party, he keeps his companions at arm's length. There are many
possible reasons for his behavior. He may be a fugitive from the law, unjustly
accused of a crime, or a renegade from a government allied with evil. He may
be doing penance for an ethos violation. Or &quot;he&quot; may be a woman, compelled to
hide her sex because of social customs that restrict females from becoming
paladins.
<P></P>
<I>?? Secondary Traits:</I> Quiet, studious, eccentric, impulsive, threatening, nervous.
<P></P>
<I>?? Suggested Kits:</I> Expatriate, Ghosthunter, Inquisitor, Wyrmslayer.
<P></P>
<B>
<P></P>
Tormented</B>
<P></P>
?? The tormented paladin lives in the shadow of insecurity and self-doubt. She
holds herself to impossibly high standards, sometimes measuring her deeds against
those of renowned paladins of history or legend, never considering that those
deeds may have been fictional or exaggerated. At her core, the tormented
paladin feels unworthy to serve her government or church, this despite her
unimpeachable ethics and flawless performance on the battlefield. She scoffs at praise,
resists assurance from her friends, and continually berates herself for
perceived mistakes.
<P></P>
?? <I>Secondary Traits:</I> Kind, sullen, analytical, shy, humble, sorrowful
<P></P>
<I>?? Suggested Kits:</I> Chevalier, Divinate, Expatriate, Divinate, Squire.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Vengeful</B>
<P></P>
?? A passionate hatred of evil fuels the vengeful paladin, who crushes his
opponents with savage fury. Often, he's motivated by revenge; perhaps he saw his
parents slaughtered by drunken ogres, or his village burned to the ground by an
evil warlord. In any case, he seems intent on singlehandedly eliminating evil from
the face of the planet.
<P></P>
<I>?? Secondary Traits:</I> Unapproachable, moody, bitter, bold, inspiring, violent.
<P></P>
<I>?? Suggested Kits:</I> Chevalier, Expatriate, Ghosthunter, Skyrider, Wyrmslayer.

<P></P>
<P></P>
?? A paladin may seek training from a lawful good cleric or another paladin. The
instructor must be at least one level higher the trainee, and skilled in the
area he's attempting to teach. The instructor must also pass a Wisdom and
Charisma check to verify his patience, insight, and authority.
<P></P>
?? The paladin must pay for his training. The DM determines the fee, based on the
difficulty of the subject and the instructor's reputation. Fees of 50-100 gp
per week are typical, but may be raised or lowed as the DM sees fit. If the
instructor has been furnished by the paladin's government or church, the paladin
may be eligible for a reduced fee. In some cases, the fee may be waived, or
exchanged for a promise of service.
<P></P>
?? To determine the training time, subtract the instructor's Wisdom from 19; the
result is the minimum number of weeks required. At the end of this period, the
paladin makes an Intelligence or Wisdom check (whichever is higher). If he
passes the check, the training has been successful. If he fails the check, he must
spend another week training. He then makes another check, with a ?1 bonus. He
may continue to make checks, with each additional week resulting in an
additional ?1 bonus.
