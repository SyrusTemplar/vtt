This powerful spell is similar to the 6th-level <I>contingency</I> spell. <I>
<P></P>
Chain contingency</I> allows the caster to designate either two or three spells that will take
effect automatically under a specific set of conditions. In other words, when a set
of conditions is met, the designated spells are &quot;cast&quot; immediately without the
caster's intervention.
<P></P>
<I>Chain contingency</I> must be cast together with the spells it is to trigger. The caster may choose
either two spells to occur simultaneously or three spells to occur
consecutively, one per round. Spells must be of 8th level or lower. Only the 6th-level <I>contingency </I>spell may not be included. The casting time of 2 turns includes the casting of
the spells to be triggered.
<P></P>
Unlike the <I>contingency</I> spell, spells &quot;stored&quot; in <I>chain contingency</I> can affect creatures other than the caster. These instructions must be
carefully worded; the spell obeys the letter of its instructions and not the caster's
intentions.
<P></P>
In casting <I>chain contingency</I>, the wizard defines the conditions that will trigger the &quot;stored&quot; spells.
This definition must be carefully worded, but may be as limiting or general as the
caster desires. The caster also states the exact order, target, range, and
manner in which the stored spells are to be cast.
<P></P>
The spell has several limitations in triggering its spells. It does not have
any powers of discernment; thus, an instruction to &quot;target the highest-level
enemy&quot; is not possible. Furthermore, the conditions cannot involve a delay; a
spell cannot be ordered to trigger &quot;three turns after I sneeze.&quot;
<P></P>
When the named conditions are met, the <I>chain contingency</I> is automatically triggered. If all specifics of casting a spell are not
specified (e.g., target or area of effect), the effect is automatically centered on
the caster.
<P></P>
Possible triggers might include a fall from a distance greater than the
caster's height, the appearance of the first beholder within 30 feet of the caster,
or the wizard pointing his finger and pronouncing a specified word.
<P></P>
Only one <I>chain contingency</I> can be placed on the spellcaster at any one time. If a second is cast, the
first <I>chain contingency</I> is cancelled. It is possible to have both a <I>contingency</I> and a <I>chain contingency</I> operating at the same time, provided that there is no overlap in the
conditions specified for triggering the two spells.
<P></P>
Spells triggered by the <I>chain contingency</I> have a casting time of 1. If the spell is triggered under conditions that are
impossible to fulfill, it fails. If one of the spells in a series cannot be
fulfilled, the remaining spells in the series are lost. Normal conditions,
including line of sight to the target, must be fulfilled. All spells originate from
the caster; thus, it is not possible for a caster to <I>teleport</I> and leave behind a series of <I>fireballs</I> to blast his enemies. In this case, the <I>fireballs</I> would either fail or destroy something at the caster's destination.
<P></P>
The material components are (in addition to those of the companion spells) 500
gp worth of quicksilver; a gem of at least 1,000 gp value; an eyelash from an
ogre mage, ki-rin, or similar spell-using creature; and an ivory statuette of
the wizard (which is not destroyed in the casting of the spell) which must be
carried by the spellcaster in order for the <I>chain contingency</I> to perform its function when triggered.
