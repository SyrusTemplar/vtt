Even a simple expedition to slay a monster can send tremors through the world.
For example, consider the aftereffects when the PCs search out a venerable red
dragon’s lair, slay the beast, and return with heaps of treasure.
<P></P>
First, the dragon is a fearsome creature, probably the most powerful monster
within several hundred miles of its lair. The dragon’s death most likely
produces a local power vacuum. Many types of evil creatures, from ambitious giants to
upstart younger dragons, could become embroiled in a struggle to occupy the
dragon’s former position in the power structure (not to mention fighting over
possession of the abandoned lair). Perhaps one or more fairly powerful groups of
lesser creatures become free to expand now that the dragon is no longer around to
keep them in check. Anything from a community of mountain dwarves to a horde
of trolls might take over the area after a few years.
<P></P>
Second, the PCs can set all kinds of things in motion just by enjoying the
spoils of victory. A treasure as large as a dragon’s hoard is bound to attract
attention, perhaps even before the PCs begin spending it. If they carry it off by
normal means, thieves and brigands are bound to take notice. Once the PCs begin
to spend their money, the local economy might boom from the influx of
cash—especially if the PCs spend it on things like castles, land, or businesses. The
local economy might suffer ruinous inflation. Eventually, thieves and other
adventurers learn about all the neat gems and magical items the PCs have recovered,
and they may plot to steal some of it for themselves. If the characters
distribute magic to their henchmen, their enemies suddenly have a problem—the
competition just got a lot tougher. If the PCs don’t share their spoils, they’re going
to have unhappy henchmen.
<P></P>
All of the foregoing assumes that the DM hasn’t put any special effort into
the dragon’s lair. Some of the items from the lair might be significant to the
campaign. For example, what do the people in the neighboring kingdom do if they
learn that a legendary sword lost in antiquity shows up in a PC’s hands. The
character might be in for a wild ride; the holder of the sword might inherit
anything from a claim to a throne to an ancient blood feud. Now consider what might
happen if a deity or dragon ruler starts wondering who it was that slew the
mighty dragon? Remember also that dragons have offspring and long memories.
