The nurturer always seeks to help those around him, whether the beneficiary is
a plant, beast, or human; he feels especially drawn to the suffering of
others. Unlike the gardener, the character concerns himself more with individuals
than with communities or members of a particular alignment. The character may work
as a professional healer, but also may take a more active role. For instance,
he might go adventuring to seek and rescue captives and victims of oppression.
Whatever his reason for joining a party, he cannot resist a genuine cry for
help.

The character does well providing emotional support to others, and people
frequently turn to him with their troubles. He often proves a tower of strength in
a crisis, rarely losing his courage. In combat, the character prefers to take a
defensive role, protecting others and healing the injured. The character,
while not a pacifist, remains reluctant to engage in violence, except to defend
those under his care.
<P></P>
The nurturer comes as close to a good alignment as any other druid personality
archetype. However, he does provide care without regard to the victim's
alignment. Also, unlike most good characters, this druid gives as high a priority to
the suffering of beasts as to the plight of humans.
