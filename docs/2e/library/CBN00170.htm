As the sample campaign has shown, vivid and believable characters are
essential to keep a convoluted plot moving forward. NPC necromancers are not passive,
boring hulks, lurking in a crypt, waiting for an unsuspecting party to wander
by. Each has his or her own agenda, plans, and ambitions, and these may-or may
not-coincide with allied necromancers, even in an allied organization. In the
last section of this book, we finally present seven of the necromancers and death
priests to whom we have alluded throughout this book, as concrete examples of
the multiplicity of roles these characters can play in the campaign.

Two of these characters, Ellandra and Mistress Yola, are purposefully
independent from the Necromancer Kings campaign and can easily introduce a group of PCs
to an entirely different series of adventures involving the Anatomical Academy
and Ellandra-s goal to restore her dead husband. The DM should feel free to
tailor or modify the backgrounds for any of the other characters to suit the
needs of a particular setting. May these necrophiles provide you with inspiration
for countless more intriguing characters in your campaign.
