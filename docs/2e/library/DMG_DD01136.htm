<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Trident of Yearning:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A <I>trident of yearning</I> looks exactly like any normal trident, and its aura is indistinguishable from
that of other enchanted weapons of this sort. Any character grasping this type
of trident immediately feels an overwhelming desire to immerse himself in as
great a depth of water as possible. This unquenchable longing causes the
affected character to proceed immediately toward the largest/deepest body of water-in
any event, one that is sufficient to completely cover his or her person. Once
there, he will immerse himself permanently.
<P></P>
The character cannot loose his grip on the trident, and only a <I>water breathing</I> spell (after submersion) or a <I>wish</I> will enable the character to do so. The trident is otherwise a -2 cursed
magical weapon. Note that this item does not confer the ability to breathe
underwater.
