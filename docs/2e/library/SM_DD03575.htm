Strength of Sensory Signatures</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
All sorts of conditions may influence the obviousness of a spell; a <I>lightning bolt </I>may be reduced to a dim, distant flash in a deep fog, but the crack of the
thunderbolt will still be quite audible! The number of creatures affected by a
spell can be used as a rough measure of the strength of a sensory signature, as
shown in <A HREF="DD03576.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03576.htm">Table 40</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Sensory Signatures.

For example, a <I>fireball </I>normally affects a 20-foot radius, so it would be considered a huge signature
detectable at a range of 500 feet under good visibility conditions. On the
other hand, <I>polymorph other </I>affects only one target, so it would be a medium signature spotted at a range
of 50 feet. Obviously, the DM has a great deal of latitude here; spells break
the rules of the game, and many defy classification.
<P></P>
If the visibility is poor, the ranges listed above could be reduced by as much
as 50 to 75 percent. However, simple darkness may not conceal spells with
brilliant or fiery effects; if anything, a <I>fireball </I>or <I>lightning bolt</I> is even more visible at nighttime than it is in daylight!
<P></P>
Spells can usually be heard or smelled at half the range they can be seen and
felt at one-tenth the visibility range. The roar of a <I>fireball </I>normally carries for 250 feet or so, even if the blast itself is out of sight
around a corner or behind a hill. A deafened character who isn?t looking at the
blast can still feel the heat of the <I>fireball </I>from as far as 50 feet away. However, sound and smells may not propagate in a
perfect circle from the spell?s targeting point?if there?s a strong wind
blowing, the faint stench of a <I>stinking cloud </I>may be noticeable a mile or more downwind, while stone walls and large areas
of still water may reflect or bounce sounds to several times their normal
carrying distance.
