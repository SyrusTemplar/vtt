This spell enables the wizard to cast small globes of fire (one for each
experience level he has attained), each of which bursts into a 1-foot-diameter
sphere upon impact, inflicting 1d4 points of damage to the creature struck. It can
also ignite combustible materials (even solid planks). The meteors are treated
as missiles hurled by the wizard with a +2 bonus to the attack rolls and with no
penalty for range. Misses are treated as grenadelike missiles that inflict 1
point of damage to creatures within 3 feet.
<P></P>
The spell can be cast in either of two ways:
<P></P>
A) The wizard discharges five meteors every round (see the ?<A HREF="DD01693.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01693.htm">Multiple Attacks and Initiative</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">? section in Chapter 9: Combat). Note that this carries over into at least the
following round.
<P></P>
B) The wizard discharges only one meteor per round. In addition to releasing
the missile, the caster can perform other actions in the round, including
spellcasting, melee, or device use. Spells requiring concentration force the wizard
to forgo the rest of the missiles to maintain concentration. Also, if the wizard
fails to maintain an exact mental count of the number of missiles he has
remaining, he has involuntarily lost the remaining portion of the spell.
<P></P>
The spell ends when the caster has fired off as many meteors as he has
experience levels, when he forgoes casting any still remaining, or when a successful <I>dispel magic</I> spell is thrown upon the caster.
<P></P>
The components necessary for the casting of this spell are nitre and sulphur
formed into a bead by the addition of pine tar. The caster must also have a
small hollow tube of minute proportion, fashioned from gold. The tube costs no less
than 1,000 gp to construct, so fine is its workmanship and magical engraving,
and it can be reused.
