<TITLE>Cowardice-- Disadvantage (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
<script src="jscripts.js"></script><link rel="stylesheet" href="toc.css"></HEAD><BODY>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cowardice</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">: This is a hefty disadvantage for an adventuring character. The character
might want to be brave and to fight heroically, but an inner voice of caution
constantly suggests the merits of flight or concealment. Halflings receive 1 extra
character point when they choose this disadvantage.
<P></P>
When a violent encounter begins, the character must pass a Wisdom/Willpower
check to overcome his cowardice. The roll is 1/2 the character's Wisdom/Willpower
if this is a severe disadvantage. If the check is successful, the character
can behave in any fashion for the duration of the encounter. If the check fails,
however, the character will seek to leave, to hide behind friends, or to
otherwise cravenly attempt to avoid the fight.
<P></P>
The character is allowed to make another Wisdom/Willpower check each
subsequent round during the encounter. He flees or hides as long as he fails, but as
soon as he passes the check he can perform normally-and is exempt from any further
checks. (Of course, if he tried to hide behind his friends, a second violent
encounter might occur immediately after the first is resolved!)
