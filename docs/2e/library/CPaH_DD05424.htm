   <B>Barding of aerial excellence:</B> This resembles a normal set of chain barding for a horse, elephant, or other
species of land mount. When worn by a bonded mount, the <I>barding</I> sprouts metallic wings approximately twice as long as the length of the
mount; a command word from the bonded mount's paladin triggers this effect. The
metal wings enable the mount to fly at a speed equal to its normal ground speed, at
Maneuverability Class C. Further, the <I>barding of aerial excellence</I> imbues the mount with the necessary flying skill; it can fly as if the wings
were part of its body.
<P></P>
   A paladin without the airborne riding proficiency makes attacks at a –2
penalty when riding a mount with the <I>barding of aerial excellence</I>. To avoid being unseated, he must make Dexterity checks as determined by the
DM. A paladin with the airborne riding proficiency makes normal attacks.
<P></P>
   The wings last for 1-4 hours; the mount senses when the wings are about to
disappear, giving it time to safely land. The <I>barding of aerial excellence</I> can sprout wings once per day; otherwise, it functions as normal barding. It
also functions as normal barding on animals other than bonded mounts.
<P></P>
   <B>Bridle of calming:</B> This leather bridle, designed to fit a specific species of mount, makes the
mount immune to all types of magical <I>fear</I>. For morale purposes, the <I>bridle of calming</I> gives the mount a effective moral rating of Fearless (19-20). A <I>bridle</I> <I>of calming</I> may be used on both bonded and normal mounts.
<P></P>
<B>   Crest of summoning:</B> When attached to the paladin's helmet. the <I>crest of summoning</I> enables the paladin to mentally summon his bonded mount at a radius equal to
10 miles per level of the paladin (a 6th-level paladin can summon his bonded
mount within a 60-mile radius). If the bonded mount has been captured or is
disabled, the <I>crest</I> causes a dull throb behind the paladin's eyes, indicating that the mount is
unable to respond; however, the crest won't indicate the location of the mount.
<P></P>
   <B>Oil of tempering:</B> When this oil is applied to entire suit of chain or other metallic armor, the
armor's AC is improved by 1 for 24 hours; for example, chain mail armor (AC 5)
will have an effective AC of 4. The AC can't be improved beyond AC 0. It takes
1-2 hours to completely coat a suit of armor with <I>oil of tempering</I>.
<P></P>
   <B>Sheath of security:</B> Less than a foot long, this leather sheath appears to the perfect size for a
dagger. In fact, a pointed weapon of any size—such as sword, spear, or
lance—may be carried in the <I>sheath of security</I>. When the tip of the weapon is placed in the sheath, the entire weapon
shrinks to the size of a normal dagger. The sheath holds the shrunken weapon tightly;
the weapon can only be removed when a command word is spoken, or when affected
by <I>knock</I> or a similar spell. The weapon retains its shrunken size until the tip leaves
the sheath. It then expands to its normal size.
<P></P>
   <B>Tithing bag:</B> This is a small purse made of black velvet, closed with a drawstring. Any
coins, gems, or treasure placed in the bag are instantaneously teleported to the
character's church or other charitable institution. The character keeps a small
chip of stone, wood, or glass from the designated institution in the bottom of
the bag to indicate the destination. It otherwise has a capacity of 20 gp. A <I>tithing bag</I> functions for lawful good characters only.
<P></P>
<B>   Tunic of comfort:</B> This light cloth garment may be worn over chain mail or other uncomfortable
armor. The <I>tunic of comfort</I> distributes the weight of the armor evenly over the body, enabling the
character to wear his armor indefinitely without chafing or fatigue.

<P></P>
<P></P>
   Each of these <I>holy swords</I> has all the special characteristics discussed in Chapter 2, in addition to
the specific benefits given in their individual descriptions. The bonuses (+3,
+4, and so on) apply to both attack and damage rolls. In the hands of any
character other than a paladin, all of these <I>holy swords</I> perform as <I>swords +2</I>.
<P></P>
   <B>Sword +3 purifier.</B> When a paladin holds this weapon in front of him, he turns undead as a cleric
of equal level; a 3rd-level paladin turns undead with the same effectiveness
as a 3rd-level cleric (use Table 19 in Chapter 4). The paladin must be of 3rd
level or higher to turn undead, with or without this sword. Ghosthunters receive
no turning bonus.
<P></P>
   The sword provides two benefits to paladins of all levels: a +5 bonus against
all undead; and +2 bonus to saving throws against undead magical attacks,
including a ghoul's paralyzing touch and a vampire's <I>charm</I>.
<P></P>
   <B>Sword +4 divine protector.</B> This sword alerts the paladin to the presence of evil by generating a soft
hum that only he can hear. The sword detects evil within a 60-foot-radius of the
paladin, but does not indicate the direction or intensity of the source. The
hum is automatic, so long as the sword remains on the paladin's person. The hum
is loud enough to awaken the paladin from a normal sleep, alert him to an
ambush, or warn him of an evil character behind his back. Otherwise, the sword has
all of the benefits and limitations of the paladin's detect evil intent ability,
described in Chapter 2.
<P></P>
   Additionally, if the paladin spends one full round swinging this sword over
his head, all evil creatures and characters within a 60-foot-radius hear a
disturbing sirenlike sound, audible only to them. Any affected creature or character
who fails to save vs. paralyzation will continue to hear the siren ringing in
his ears for the next 2-5 (1d4+1) rounds, with similar effects as a <I>deafness</I> spell (unable to hear any sounds, –1 penalty to surprise rolls, and a 20%
chance of miscasting spells with verbal components).
<P></P>
   <B>Sword +4 invigorator.</B> If the paladin heals a damaged creature or character by laying on hands, then
touches him with this sword, the amount of recovered hit points increases by
half. For instance, if a 6th-level paladin has just restored 12 hit points by
laying on hands, the sword restores an additional 6 points.
<P></P>
   <B>Sword +5 hallowed redeemer.</B> Not only does this sword project a 10-foot-diameter circle of power, it also
causes all evil characters and creatures within the area of effect to succumb
to the effects of a <I>fear</I> spell. The <I>fear</I> effects may be avoided by a successful saving throw vs. spell.
