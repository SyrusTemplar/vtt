The following skills are available to mages and specialist wizards who meet
the listed requirements.

temporary bonus to their Intelligence, Wisdom, or Dexterity scores.
<P></P>
By concentrating for one round and making a successful skill check, the wizard
can improve one of the three eligible ability scores to the value listed on
the <A HREF="DD01373.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01373.htm">table below</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. The improvement lasts one round per character level. Because the majority of
the character's energy is directed to the improved ability score, the other
two ability scores are reduced by two for the same duration. The wizard can end
the boost-and restore the values of the other scores-at any time. If the
character's ability score is already equal to or higher than the value listed on the
table, this skill has no effect. If the optional subabilities rule from <A HREF="SP_DD02867.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="SP_DD02867.htm">Skills &amp; Powers</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>is in play, both subabilities in the increased ability score are raised to the
same value.

The wizard can take no other actions during the round the character is
concentrating on raising the selected ability score. Each attempt, successful or not,
during a single day lowers the base skill score by two; the skill cannot be
used once the base score falls to zero or less.
<P></P>
Bonuses from an increased score are applied immediately when the skill
succeeds and are lost immediately when the boost's duration ends. For example, a
wizard who chooses to increase Dexterity immediately gains an improved Armor Class
bonus, but loses it again when the character's Dexterity score returns to
normal. Likewise, the effects from reduced ability scores are applied immediately
when the improvement ends.
<P></P>
A character can have only one ability score improvement from this skill
operating at any given time.

</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Signature Item:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>A wizard with this skill chooses an item from the character's collection of
equipment as a personal trademark that is specially protected from twists of
fate. Except as noted below, this skill operates exactly like the warrior skill of
the same name.
<P></P>
The wizard is free to have as many signature items as he is willing to pay
for, but no more than one of any type of item is allowed. For example, the wizard
could not have two <I>staffs of the magi </I>as signature items, but he could have a <I>staff of the magi, wand of magic missiles</I>, and a <I>rod of smiting </I>as signature items.
<P></P>
The wizard can choose items from the ring, rod, staff, wand, miscellaneous
magic, and weapon categories.

</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Spell Sculpting:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>A wizard with this skill knows one spell so well the character can alter its
statistics when casting it.
<P></P>
To use this skill, the wizard must prepare an item to help focus and reshape
the spell's magical energy. A focus item can be a small object such as a jewel,
wand, or amulet. A focus item must be worth at least 500 gp per spell level.
<P></P>
When sculpting, the wizard must meet all the usual requirements to cast the
spell; the wizard employs the focus item as an additional material component,
which is normally not consumed. A successful skill roll allows the wizard to
change the spell in a minor way, as listed below. If the roll fails, the spell is
cast normally. If failure roll is a 20, the focus item is destroyed.
<P></P>
When a wizard successfully sculpts a spell, the character can choose one
effect from the list below.
<P></P>
<I>Increase Damage: </I>The spell can inflict an extra two dice of damage of the type normally rolled
to determine the damage the spell inflicts. For example, Neja, a 20th-level
wizard, could sculpt a <I>burning hands </I>spell to inflict 3d3+20 points of damage. If Neja sculpted a <I>fireball </I>spell to increase damage, the spells would inflict 12d6 points of damage.
<P></P>
Spells that have individual damage dice, such as magic missile, are not
increased individually. For example, Neja could cast a <I>magic missile </I>that inflicted a total of 7d4+7 points of damage. The additional damage could
be added to a single missile or an additional die of damage could be added to
two separate missiles.
<P></P>
Spells that do not use dice rolls to determine damage cannot be sculpted in
this manner.
<P></P>
<I>Extend Duration:</I> The spell's total duration is doubled. This applies only to the actual time a
spell lasts but not to any special durations a spell may have.
<P></P>
For instance, <I>invisibility </I>would last a total of 48 hours or until the creature made an attack. Neja's <I>stoneskin </I>would have a duration of 48 hours or until it had blocked 1d4+10 attacks
(refer to the spell commentary for <A HREF="DD01278.htm#3db1ebfb"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01278.htm#3db1ebfb">stoneskin</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). Spells with instantaneous durations cannot be sculpted in this manner.
<P></P>
<I>Extend Range: </I>The spell's range is doubled. If the spell has a range of touch or 0, its
range cannot be extended.
<P></P>
<I>Shorten Casting Time:</I> The spell's casting time is cut in half, to a minimum of 1. If local
conditions lengthen the spell's casting time (see <A HREF="DD01232.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01232.htm">page 47</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">), apply the multiplier first, then cut the result in half.
<P></P>
It is not possible to sculpt a spell more than once. It is possible, however,
to employ a metamagic spell, such as <I>extension </I>or <I>squaring the circle</I>, to a spell that has been sculpted provided that the sculpting effect does
not duplicate the metamagic spell effect. For example, a wizard cannot extend a
spell's duration and use an <I>extension </I>spell at the same time. A wizard could sculpt a spell to extend its range and
use and <I>extension </I>spell to increase its duration.
<P></P>
The highest level spell a wizard can sculpt is limited by the character-s
level, as shown below:

A wizard can learn to sculpt more than one spell but must pay the full cost
for this skill for each spell. If the wizard improves the skill's base score, the
increase applies to all spells the wizard knows how to sculpt.
