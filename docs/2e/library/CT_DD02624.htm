Weapon Proficiencies
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Most character classes are limited in their selection of weapons. However, in
the <A HREF="SP_DD03145.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="SP_DD03145.htm">Skills &amp; Powers</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>book, a character may choose to be proficient in a weapon she normally would
not be allowed to use. This is reflected by requiring the character to spend
more character points than normal to become proficient.
<P></P>
As an optional rule, characters may learn to use barred weapons by paying
extra proficiency slots. A rogue or priest may learn a weapon normally reserved for
warriors by suffering a one-slot penalty, and wizards may learn weapons
normally reserved for priests or rogues with a one-slot penalty. If a wizard wishes
to learn the use of a weapon normally reserved for warriors only, she must pay a
two-slot penalty. For example, a wizard who wants to use a long sword could do
so by paying two weapon proficiencies for it, since long swords are available
for roguesâ€”but she would have to pay three slots to become proficienct in the
two-handed sword.
<P></P>
Note that the limited number of weapon proficiencies available for nonwarrior
characters will tend to control character abuse of this rule. Priests may be <I>capable </I>of learning any weapons under these rules, but priests who use barred weapons
do so at the risk of angering their superiors or deity.
