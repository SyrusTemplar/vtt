The most powerful priesthood in a given land will probably have the right to
crown kings when they ascend the throne. The DM has to decide whether this is
merely an honor bestowed on the priesthood, or whether it is a right which the
priesthood can use to influence the throne.
<P></P>
If it's the former, then the chief priest is accorded the right to officiate
at the coronation ceremony. However, if the priest refused to officiate, the
crowning will take place anyway; the king can choose another priesthood for the
honor, or he can be crowned without the priesthood's sanction.
<P></P>
If it's the latter, then the priesthood can deny someone the right to take the
throne by refusing to crown him. This is a very powerful right, and through it
the priesthood can exert considerable influence on the nation.
<P></P>
That's not to say that, by refusing to crown a certain candidate, the
priesthood can stage a bloodless coup and choose the king.
<P></P>
Let's assume a priesthood does such a thing and refuses the chief candidate
for the throne, then spreads the word they will support a certain other candidate.
<P></P>
The refused candidate may decide to mount a war against the priesthood. The
new candidate, if crowned, may find that none of the other nobles in the nation
support his kingship. All of this can result in a bloody civil war which could
tear the nation apart and wreck the priesthood's power.
<P></P>
Therefore, when the priesthood decides to exercise this power, it does tend to
make compromises, to negotiate secretly with the parties involved, to plan
things carefully so that trouble is kept to a minimum. Only the most arrogant of
priesthoods would try to take for itself the full right to choose the king . . .
and such priesthoods are likely to lead their nation into war or chaos.
