The word bardiche is the corrupted spelling of berdysh. The berdysh (Russian
term) is in effect an elongated battleaxe with a large, narrow, curved axe head
measuring 24 to 32 inches long, mounted on a pole five to eight feet long.

The upper part of the head can be used for thrusting, while the lower part is
in the form of a langet. A langet is an iron strap used to increase the
strength of the head and protect the most exposed part of the weapon from blows.
<P></P>
Berdysh require more room to wield than a pike or a spear, but the weapon has
a unique function: it can be used as a gun rest. The smaller berdysh have two
rings for attaching to a shoulder strap. This arrangement is popular among
horsemen.
