<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Gauntlets of Dexterity:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A pair of these gloves appears to be nothing more than light-weight leather
handwear of the everyday sort. Naturally, the radiate magic if so detected. They
size themselves magically to fit any hand, from that of a huge human to that of
a small halfling. <I>Gauntlets of Dexterity</I> increase overall Dexterity by 4 points if the wearer's Dexterity is 6 or
less, by 2 points if at 7-13, and by 1 point if Dexterity is 14 or higher.
Furthermore, wearing these gloves enables a nonthief character to pick pockets (45%
chance) or open locks (37% chance) as if he were a 4th-level thief. If worn by a
thief, they increase these two abilities by 10%.
