Armor does interfere with a character's gracefulness in many situations. For
this reason, we assign the character a penalty to Dexterity checks (and
dexterity-based nonweapon proficiencies) when the character is in armor; those
penalties are listed on the armor chart above.
<P></P>
These penalties are applied when the character is using all nonweapon
proficiencies except Riding (Land-based or Airborne) or Charioteering, which are exempt
from the penalty. (Why someone would be performing many of those skills in
armor is a mystery . . . but it could happen.)
<P></P>
In addition, the penalty prescribed for the shields is applied when the
character is using the nonweapon proficiencies Juggling, Tightrope Walking and
Tumbling. (The DM may choose to disallow the shield penalty for certain examples of
these skills' use. For example, a character who is juggling a one-handed
technique won't be put off by having a shield on the other hand. But these exceptions
will be rare.)

These dexterity-roll penalties are provided only for those gamers to whom the
matter means something. If you don't care about such things, don't use these
rules: they'd merely be an annoyance and extra complication for you.
<P></P>
But if you prefer for a character to be a little less graceful when in full
plate or hide than in soft leather or no armor at all, these rules are for your
campaign.
