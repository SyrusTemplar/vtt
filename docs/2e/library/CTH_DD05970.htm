Clawed gloves will be familiar to Oriental Adventures players as tiger's
claws, but the DM may allow their availability in any fantasy campaign. Clawed
overshoes, similar in design to clawed gloves, also existed and may be permitted
(although they are a lot less common). The overshoes are slipped over the thief's
normal footwear. The thief uses these clawed items for extra grip on small
nooks and crannies of whatever surface he is climbing, so the bonus to the climb
walls roll depends on the type of surface being climbed.
<P></P>
On very smooth surfaces where almost no nooks and crannies exist, clawed
gloves and boots will not add anything to the climb walls chance for a thief. For
smooth/cracked surfaces, clawed gloves add +5% to the climb walls chance, boots
add +5% also, the two together add +10%. For any other type of surface, clawed
gloves add +10%, clawed boots add +10%, and the combination adds +20% to the
climb walls roll. Rates of movement are not altered.
<P></P>
The use of clawed gloves reduces silent movement rolls by -5%, the use of
clawed boots by -10%, and the combination by -15%, if the thief is attempting to
move silently during his climb (e.g., trying to evade detection by guards atop a
parapet).
<P></P>
Clawed gloves can be used as a melee weaponâ€”no weapon proficiency is required
for their use. A successful hit inflicts 1 additional point of damage to that
normally delivered by a fist blow. Clawed overshoes may similarly be used as a
weapon, adding damage to a kick attack, if the DM allows such attack options in
melee.
