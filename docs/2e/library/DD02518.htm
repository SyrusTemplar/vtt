few against the many. The legend of Roland holding the pass of Roncesvalles,
or Davy Crockett at the Alamo, or Tolkien’s tale of the Fellowship standing
against the orcs of Moria in Balin’s tomb—these stories live forever in the
imaginations of people everywhere.

In a heroic fray, the PCs are fighting against hordes of individually weak
monsters such as goblins, kobolds, or giant rats. Warriors facing adversaries far
less skillful than themselves can double their normal rate of attack. This only
applies to their primary weapon; if the character is fighting with a weapon in
each hand, the secondary weapon still adds only one additional attack per
round. Any attacks of opportunity the heroic warrior receives must be counted off
against these additional attacks, however.
<P></P>
In addition, warriors gain one extra attack per round which may be used to
perform a shield-punch, shield-rush, unarmed punch or kick, or grab maneuver
against any opponent that they threaten when they begin resolving their attacks for
the round. The normal penalties for these attacks don’t apply, so the shield
maneuvers don’t cost the warrior his AC bonus, and the unarmed maneuvers don’t
provoke attacks of opportunity.
<P></P>
Characters can only engage in a heroic fray against creatures of 1–1 Hit Dice
or less, or creatures whose Hit Dice or levels are 10 less than the hero’s. A
12th-level fighter can declare a heroic fray against monsters of up to 2 HD, a
13th-level fighter can stand against 3-HD monsters, and so on.
<P></P>
The other requirement of a heroic fray is numbers. The hero’s side must be
outnumbered by the enemy for the warrior to gain his extra attacks. If there are
fewer monsters left than attacks available, the excess attacks are lost.
