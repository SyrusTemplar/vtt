This druid champions the common people. She prefers a roadside inn to a
noble's castle and would rather visit a village fair than a knightly tournament.
Depending on whether she likes to stay in one place or move around, she'll usually
have either the Outlaw, Village Druid, Avenger, or Wanderer kits. She has no
interest in wealth--what she earns or finds she either gives to the needy or
devotes to projects aimed at improving people's lives.
<P></P>
The rustic won't take any actions she believes would endanger or exploit
peasants; she always tries to suggest plans by which the party's actions might
benefit the commoners. For instance, instead of rescuing a noble from a band of
orcs, she'd prefer to take action against a robber baron who has been oppressing
his tenants. Afterward, she'll try to make sure the peasants reclaim some of the
treasure their greedy overlord took from them.
<P></P>
If the character witnesses any kind of oppression of the common people, she
becomes angry and wants to do something about it. If possible, she'll try to fix
the situation--overthrow the evil baron, free the slaves, etc. If she doesn't
believe she can win, she--ll usually try to make some gesture to help the
victims, perhaps by giving agricultural advice, suggesting means of passive
resistance, curing disease, donating money, or even helping a single family escape to a
better life. Then she'll vow to come back and do more when she gains the power
to help. In short, the rustic believes in treating all fairly, regardless of
social class.
