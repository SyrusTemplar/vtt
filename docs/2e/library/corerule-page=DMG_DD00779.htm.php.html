<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Protection from Undead:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">(Reading timeâ€”4) When this scroll is read, a 5-foot radius circle of
protection extends from, and moves with, the reader. It protects everyone within it from
all physical attacks made by undead (ghasts, ghosts, ghouls, shadows,
skeletons, spectres, wights, wraiths, vampires, zombies, etc.) but not magical spells
or other attack forms. If a creature leaves the protected area, it is subject to
physical attack. The protection restrains up to 35 Hit Dice/levels of undead;
excess Hit Dice/levels can pass through the circle. It remains in effect for
10d8 rounds. Some protection scrolls of this nature protect only against certain
types of undead (one or more) rather than all undead, at the DM's option.
