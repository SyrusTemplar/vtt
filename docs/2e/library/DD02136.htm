This spell causes a luminous glow within 20 feet of the spell's center. The
area of light thus caused is equal in brightness to torchlight. Objects in
darkness beyond this sphere can be seen, at best, as vague and shadowy shapes. The
spell is centered on a point selected by the caster, and he must have a line of
sight or unobstructed path to that point when the spell is cast. Light can
spring from air, rock, metal, wood, or almost any similar substance. The effect is
immobile unless it is specifically centered on a movable object or mobile
creature. If this spell is cast upon a creature, any applicable magic resistance and
saving throws must be rolled. Successful resistance negates the spell, while a
successful saving throw indicates that the spell is centered immediately behind
the creature, rather than upon the creature itself. A <I>light</I> spell centered on the visual organs of a creature blinds it, reducing its
attack and saving throw rolls by 4 and worsening its Armor Class by 4. The caster
can extinguish the light at any time by uttering a single word. <I>Light</I> spells are not cumulative--multiple castings do not provide a brighter light.
<P></P>
The spell is reversible, causing darkness in the same area and under the same
conditions as the <I>light</I> spell, but with half the duration. Magical darkness is equal to that of an
unlit interior room--pitch darkness. Any normal light source or magical light
source of lesser intensity than full daylight does not function in magical
darkness. A <I>darkness</I> spell cast directly against a <I>light</I> spell cancels both, and vice versa.
