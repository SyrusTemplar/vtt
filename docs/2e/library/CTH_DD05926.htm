This is going to be of major importance to almost all thieves' guilds, and
there are four important points relating to it:
<P></P>
<I>Location and Cover:</I> Where is the guildhouse, and what does it look like upfront? The DM must
choose a location and cover suitable to the town or city, and the nature of the
guild. It could be a fortified large building among warehouses or down by the
docks, an underground cellar complex below the private home of a senior thief,
entered via the sewers, or the basements and cellars of a tavern in a shady part of
town. A small guild may only meet in the back room of a shady tavern, of
course, but any significant guild needs somewhere fairly secret and strong.
<P></P>
<I>Contents:</I> What's in the guildhouse? Is equipment kept hidden there or does the
quartermaster carry it with him (unlikely unless he has a bag of holding)? Are there
hidey-holes? How many exits are there (there will usually be several)?
<P></P>
<I>Guards:</I> Who protects the guildhouse? Can reinforcements be summoned quickly? If there
is a building which is a front for the place (e.g., a tavern above the cellars
of the guildhouse below), can extra help (hefty fighters) be had quickly?<I>
<P></P>
Traps</I> <I>and Protections:</I> The guildhouse will almost certainly have magical and mechanical traps?the
entrance may be a very strong door, with a couple of locks (and only guildmembers
have keys). Down a passage, a secret door may be placed to allow
entrance?following the passage leads into very unpleasant traps. Magical traps may have been
paid for, or placed by mage/thieves. Mechanical traps will be of many kinds,
but will often use disabling/paralyzing attacks just in case a novice makes a
mistake and takes the wrong turn somewhere!
<P></P>
Bearing all these points in mind, the DM should design the guildhouse, drawing
floorplans and maps.
