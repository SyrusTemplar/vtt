An <I>embalm</I> spell enables the caster to protect a corpse (or a harvested part thereof)
against the natural forces of decay and dissolution, until some later time when
it is needed for a spell. If the <I>embalmed </I>cadaver is later animated as a zombie, golem, or other form of animated
undead, the creature gains +2 hit points per hit die (8 hp/HD maximum) because of the
greater strength and resiliency imparted by the spell to the dead tissue. It
has no beneficial effect if cast on skeletal remains or on previously animated
undead.
<P></P>
Thus preserved, a corpse permanently retains the same odor and appearance it
had at the time of casting. <I>Embalm </I>does not reverse the effects of putrefaction, but it does prevent any further
decay of an individual’s physical remains. Unlike more powerful spells (such as <I>Nulathoe’s ninemen (FOR)</I> or the clerical spell<I> spirit bind</I>), <I>embalm</I> does not facilitate subsequent resurrection of a corpse. The material
component is a drop of vinegar.
