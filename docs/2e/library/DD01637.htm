</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Encumbrance is divided into five categories: Unencumbered, Light, Moderate,
Heavy, and Severe Encumbrance.
<P></P>
To calculate your character's encumbrance category, first figure out the total
weight he is carrying (including five pounds for clothing). Then look across
the row corresponding to your character's Strength on <A HREF="DD01639.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01639.htm">Table 47</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> until you come to the column that includes your character's carried weight.
The heading at the top of that column shows his level of encumbrance.
<P></P>
Use <A HREF="DD01641.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01641.htm">Table 49</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> to figure out the encumbrance category of your character's mount or beast of
burden.
<P></P>
The Max. Carried Wgt. column lists the most weight (in pounds) your character
can carry and still move. But movement is limited to 10 feet per round, as your
character staggers under the heavy load.
