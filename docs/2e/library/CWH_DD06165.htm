Diviners can take advantage of their skills by charging for their fortune
telling services. While it is common for kings and other noblemen to retain the
services of an astrologer, palm reader, or other type of fortune teller, some
wizards set up shop on their own, charging a fee to anyone in need of their
talents. Unscrupulous wizards have been known to sell their services as fortune
tellers to superstitious peasants, even though these wizards may lack any actual
ability in this area.
