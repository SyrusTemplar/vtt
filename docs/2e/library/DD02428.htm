A character with a cocked and loaded crossbow, or an arrow nocked and drawn in
a bow, can announce that he is covering an opponent within his weapon?s short
range. The covering character can only choose to cover a single square on the
board, as long as that square is within the weapon?s short range and in sight.
Only characters with a weapon proficiency slot in bow or crossbow can cover
someone in this manner. Covering situations usually are created by the
circumstances of the initial encounter; for example, an archer may surprise his enemy,
cover him, and order him to drop his weapon. Characters can also declare a combat
action to cover someone.
<P></P>
Since the arrow or bolt is ready to be fired, the covering character?s first
shot is fast (or very fast if the character is a specialist.) See Bows and
Crossbows in <A HREF="DD02637.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02637.htm">Chapter Seven</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. The covering character automatically wins initiative against the covered
target. It is possible for a very fast creature to beat out the shot of a
proficient archer, but even very fast creatures can be covered by a specialist.
<P></P>
The character can hold his cover until later in the round, if he wants to see
what his target is going to do. He can fire first in any later phase. After the
first shot has been loosed, the covering character can perform the rest of his
missile fire at the regular action phase and rate of fire.
<P></P>
The covering shot itself is made with a +2 bonus to the attack roll. Covering
is handy for freezing opponents in their tracks, since everybody knows how
quickly an arrow or bolt can be released once it is drawn.

Covering can also be used with any hand-held bladed weapon?basically, the
character puts her sword to an opponent?s throat in a single adjacent square and
menaces him. The victim must be stunned, dazed, pinned, unconscious, or surprised
for a character to cover him with a melee weapon. As with bows and crossbows,
the covering character automatically wins initiative against her target and can
attack in the fast phase, or in the very fast phase if she is a specialist.
The attack is made with a +2 bonus to hit, and the critical number (see Critical
Hits in <A HREF="DD02463.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02463.htm">Chapter Six</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) drops to a 16.
