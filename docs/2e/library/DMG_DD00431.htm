Sometimes the most effective attack is simply to pull an opponent down by
sheer numbers. No attempt is made to gain a particular hold or even to harm the
victim. The only concern is to pin and restrain him.
<P></P>
To overbear an opponent, a normal attack roll is made. For every level of size
difference (1 if a Large attacker takes on a Medium defender, for example),
the attack roll is modified by 4 (+4 if the attacker is larger; -4 if the
defender is larger).
<P></P>
The defending creature also gains a benefit if it has more than two legs: a -2
penalty to the attacker's roll for every leg beyond two. There is no penalty
to the defender if it has no legs. A lone orc attempting to pull down a horse
and rider would have at least a -8 penalty applied to the attack roll (-4 for
size and -4 for the horse's four legs).
<P></P>
If the attack succeeds, the opponent is pulled down. A character can be pinned
if further successful overbearing attacks are rolled each round. For pinning
purposes, do not use the prone modifier to combat (from <A HREF="DD00390.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00390.htm">Table 35</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> ).
<P></P>
If multiple attackers are all attempting to pull down a single target, make
only one attack roll with a +1 bonus for each attacker beyond the first. Always
use the to-hit number of the weakest attacker to figure the chance of success,
since cooperation always depends on the weakest link. Modifiers for size should
be figured for the largest attacker of the group.
<P></P>
A giant and three pixies attempting to pull down a man would use the pixies'
attack roll, modified by +3 for three extra attackers and +8 for the size
difference of the giant (Huge) and the man (Medium).
