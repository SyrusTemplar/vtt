After all other steps toward creating a character have been completed, the
player must choose an alignment for the character. In some cases (especially the
paladin), the choice of alignment may be limited.
<P></P>
The character's alignment is a guide to his basic moral and ethical attitudes
toward others, society, good, evil, and the forces of the universe in general.
Use the chosen alignment as a guide to provide a clearer idea of how the
character will handle moral dilemmas. Always consider alignment as a tool, not a
straitjacket that restricts the character. Although alignment defines general
attitudes, it certainly doesn't prevent a character from changing his beliefs,
acting irrationally, or behaving out of character.
<P></P>
Alignment is divided into two sets of attitudes: order and chaos, and good and
evil. By combining the different variations within the two sets, nine distinct
alignments are created. These nine alignments serve well to define the
attitudes of most of the people in the world.
