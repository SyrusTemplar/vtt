<P></P>
<P></P>
The characters involved in a duel have power ranks and can move across the
arena and conduct combat just as spells do.
<P></P>
A character can move one space each round instead of casting a spell. Unlike a
spell, characters can move forward or backward. If the character enters a
space containing an opposing spell, the spell takes effect just as though the spell
entered the character?s space.
<P></P>
A character has power rank of 9 plus a bonus for high Intelligence/Reason or
Wisdom/Intuition. Characters use their power ranks for conducting combat between
themselves and sometimes for resisting spells.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Characters vs. Spells:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>Opposing spells are immediately revealed when they enter a character?s square;
when a spell hits, the character knows exactly what it is. Spells have varying
effects according to their type:
<P></P>
<I>Attack Spells:</I> These take effect just as if they were cast upon the character during an
adventure. However, it is important to remember that the character is not affected
directly, only the mental construct that represents the character in the duel
is affected.
<P></P>
If the spell normally allows a saving throw, the character is entitled to one
in the duel. The saving throws by caster level optional rule (see <A HREF="DD01353.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01353.htm">page 143</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) is always used in duels; bonuses for high ability scores never apply during
a duel. Refer to the individual spell description for the spell?s effects.
<P></P>
If the spell normally requires the caster to make an attack roll, such as <I>Melf?s acid arrow</I> and all touch-delivered spells, the two characters conduct a combat to see if
the incoming spell takes effect (see the <A HREF="DD01303.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01303.htm">Character vs. Character</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> section).
<P></P>
If the spell inflicts damage, the appropriate number of hit points are
deducted from the character?s total. Characters reduced to zero hit points or less
lose the duel and suffer the effects indicated under the <B>Spoils of Victory</B> section (<A HREF="DD01306.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01306.htm">page 105</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">).
<P></P>
If a spell has any lingering effects that hinder or incapacitate the target in
any way?loss of mental control, immobilization, or any other effect that keeps
the character from casting spells or acting freely?the character cannot move
or cast spells into the arena, but he can cast counter spells or conduct combat
with the spell. This represents the character?s struggle to regain control over
his mental construct. A character with a positive hit point total can never be
removed from the arena or forced to end the duel by a spell cast as part of
the duel, such as a <I>suggestion</I> that tries to convince him to quit.
<P></P>
Combat between a character and a spell is conducted just like combat between
spells except that the affected character uses his power score. If a lock
occurs, the attacking spell is destroyed instead. Characters cannot opt to use their
power scores instead of attempting saving throws when spells first enter their
spaces.
<P></P>
When a spell first enters the same space occupied by their magical construct,
the attacking spell is revealed and the character has the option of either
making a saving throw or employing a counter spell. To cast a counter spell, the
character selects a spell that can normally conduct combat with the spell (this
can be affected by who has the advantage). The combat between spells is
conducted normally, but both the attacking spell and the counter spell are destroyed if
the counter spell wins or if there is a lock. If the counter spell is
defeated, the attacking spell affects the character. A character can cast any number of
counter spells during a round provided he has an appropriate spell memorized,
but he can only cast a single counter spell against each incoming spell.
Casting a counter spell does not prevent a character from casting a spell later in
the round.
<P></P>
<I>Defense Spells: </I>These vanish when they enter the opponent?s space. A defense spell?not an AD
spell?can also be cast in the character?s own space. A spell cast in this manner
remains in the space until destroyed or the duel ends. Any attack or
attack/defense spell that enters the space must defeat the spell before it can affect
the character, and some defense spells can also combat missiles in this manner.
<P></P>
<I>Attack/Defense Spells:</I> Unless the spell has a special ability that states otherwise, an
attack/defense spell inflicts 1d6 points of damage per spell level when it reaches an
opponent?s space. The opponent is allowed a saving throw vs. spells to negate the
damage.
<P></P>
<I>Leech Spells:</I> Unless the spell has a special ability that states otherwise, a leech spell
inflicts 1d6 points of damage per spell level when it reaches an opponent?s
space. The opponent is allowed a saving throw vs. spells to reduce the damage by
half.
<P></P>
<I>Missile Spells:</I> These spells follow the same procedures as attack spells.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Characters vs. Multiple Spells:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>If several hostile spells enter a character?s space at once, the character
deals with all of them simultaneously, making saving throws, conducting combat and
casting counter spells; it is possible for a character to cast multiple
counter spells in a single round.
<P></P>
The character must deal with any spell that began the round in his space first
and then with the fastest opposing spell, and so on until he conducts combat
with every spell in the space. If some of the spells in the space do not allow
counter spells, such as creature summoning spells, the character can use counter
spells against any spells in the space that do allow counter spells.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<B>Character vs. Character:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>Combat between characters occurs whenever two characters occupy the same space
as well as when a spell that requires an attack roll enters a character?s
space. Character combat is conducted just like spell combat, except that locks are
treated differently.
<P></P>
If a spell causes character combat, the attacker uses his power score or the
spell?s, whichever is higher. The spell takes effect if its caster wins the
combat. The spell is destroyed if it is defeated or locked. The defender can
respond with his power score or a counter spell.
<P></P>
If two characters are engaged in combat, the winning character can choose to
inflict 1d6 points of damage or send the loser 1d4 spaces away in either
direction, but in no case can the loser be moved out of the arena. If the forced
movement takes the character into a space containing an opposing spell, the spell
takes effect.
<P></P>
It is not possible to cast spells while engaged in character combat. Counter
spells cannot be used against another character.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Identifying Spells: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Spells are not readily identifiable when they are moving across the arena.
However, a spell is always revealed when it is in the same space as the opponent.
<P></P>
A character with the spellcraft proficiency can try to identify opposing
spells instead of moving or casting a spell. The character chooses any spell
currently in the arena and rolls a power check. If the roll succeeds, the spell is
revealed. This can be particularly useful for targeting specific enemy spells.
