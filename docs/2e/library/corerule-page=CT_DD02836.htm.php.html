A creature subjected to an attack that ignores armor, such as an overbearing
attempt, a short-range shot from a crossbow, or a shot from a bombardment
engine, might be entitled to an adjustment to its effective Armor Class of 10 due to
Dexterity or magic.
<P></P>
Divide a creature’s land movement rate by 9 or its flying or swimming movement
rate by 12 to get its effective Dexterity bonus against such attacks. Drop
fractions. If the creature is entitled to multiple Dexterity bonuses, it gets only
the best one. For example, a light horse, MV 24, is entitled to a –2 Armor
Class adjustment.
<P></P>
Any creature with an Armor Class of less than 0 is entitled to a magical Armor
Class adjustment equal to its negative Armor Class. For example, a great wyrm
red dragon has an Armor Class of –11. Its effective AC against a short-range
crossbow shot or wrestling attack is –3 (there is a –11 magical adjustment and a
–2 Dexterity adjustment).

<I>For example, an aarakocra is a human-type creature. It uses the humanoid
critical hit charts. Arm hits with a severity of 8 or more also make flying
impossible and force a crash landing if the aarakocra is in flight. An aarakocra
attacks with two claws, which are treated as small slashing weapons. The creature has
an effective –3 Dexterity adjustment to Armor Class due to its flying speed.
<P></P>
A beholder is a radial type creature. It uses the monster critical hit charts.
Generally, opponents must attack the creature’s central body and must make
called shots to affect the creature’s eyestalks and central eye. However,
foreleg/wing and hind leg critical hits strike the creature’s eyestalks and head
critical hits affect the creature’s central eye. The creature’s bite is treated as a
size M slashing and piercing attack.

An adult copper dragon is a dragon-type creature. Frontal and rear attacks use

Because the dragon is Gargantuan, it is immune to special effects from
critical hits inflicted by size M and smaller attacks. The dragon’s bite is treated
as a Gargantuan slashing/piecing attack. The dragon’s claws and kicks are
treated as Huge slashing attacks. The dragon’s tail slap and wing buffets are
treated as Gargantuan blunt attacks. The dragon has a combined magical and Dexterity
adjustment to its AC of –5, –2 due to its flying movement rate and –3 due to
its standard Armor Class.
