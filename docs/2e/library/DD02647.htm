The character is always free to treat his empty hand as a -secondary weapon?
and punch, grab, or otherwise annoy anyone he is fighting. The normal penalties
for using two weapons apply. If the character is also familiar with the
two-handed weapon style and his weapon can be used either one- or two-handed, he can
switch back and forth between the two styles at the beginning of every round of
combat.
<P></P>
Characters who specialize in this style gain a special AC bonus of +1 while
fighting with a one-handed weapon and no shield or off-hand weapon. By spending
an additional proficiency slot, the character can increase his AC bonus to +2,
but that-s the maximum benefit for style specialization.
