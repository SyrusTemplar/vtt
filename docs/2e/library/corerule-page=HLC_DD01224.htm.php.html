misuse. Opponents should fight based on what they know and what they can discover
about the heroes’ numbers, abilities, and plans.
<P></P>
Obviously, it is inappropriate for the DM to ignore what an opponent knows. It
is equally inappropriate, however, to assume that every opponent knows as much
about the player characters as the DM does. Note that attack is not a natural
reaction to the unknown. An opponent who does not have any clear knowledge of
the enemy is apt to retreat or negotiate.
<P></P>
Start by considering what the opponent can reasonably know about the party. If
the opponent has never fought the player characters before and didn’t notice
them approaching, then he knows almost nothing about the party. The opponent
might guess each PC’s class by observing the characters and their equipment. A
vampire, for example, might have a great attack plan, and if he is observant he
might note any elves or half elves in the party and avoid directing his <I>charm</I> at those characters. He probably does not know which characters have received <I>negative plane protection</I> spells from the party cleric.
<P></P>
On the other hand, bad guys remember player character drills. Any opponent who
has fought groups of adventurers has a basic idea about how parties generally
act. An opponent who has seen the player characters fight—or who has survived a
previous encounter with the heroes—is bound to have a very clear idea about
how a party functions.
<P></P>
In any case, plans for a combat are not complete until you consider how the
foe is gathering information. Everyone except the supremely stupid—or supremely
confident—keeps an eye out for trouble. The information-gathering effort need
not be elaborate; foes who have no particular reason to expect a fight might
simply observe things as they go about their business. More careful groups might
employ scouts or divination spells. Anyone can pick up quite a bit of information
just by questioning the locals. Note that the locals can include animals and
plants if the right spells are available.
<P></P>
Don’t overlook the possibility that a foe’s efforts to gather information
might reveal something about the foe to the player characters. If a vampire assumes
bat form to observe a party, the player characters should have a chance to
notice the bat, especially if it remains near the party for any appreciable amount
of time. Likewise, <I>crystal balls</I> create magical sensors that creatures can detect.
<P></P>
Remember that information is only as good as the opponent’s ability to assess
it. A giant bird of prey might be able observe a party for a long time as it
soars over an open plain, but its animal intelligence doesn’t allow it to analyze
what it sees very well. On the other hand, a high-level wizard or druid in
bird form might deduce a great deal from a long look at a party.
<P></P>
It’s also worth remembering that most careful groups also take pains to
conceal information about themselves; after all, the PCs are going to be gathering
information, too. For example, there’s no reason why a band of villains has to
look like an evil horde. They might choose to pose as merchants or pilgrims,
which makes it harder for player characters to trace their movements by questioning
creatures about who they have seen recently. Spells such as<I> invisibility</I> and <I>change self</I> can be quite effective in keeping player characters guessing about exactly
what they’re up against.
