<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> When a character attempts to avoid danger through the use of one of his
abilities, an ability check can be used in lieu of a saving throw.
<P></P>
For example, Ragnar the thief has broken into someone's home when he hears a
grating noise from the ceiling above him. He looks up to find a five-ton block
of the ceiling headed straight for him! He is going to need speedy reactions to
get out of the way, so a Dexterity ability check should be rolled to see if he
avoids the trap.
