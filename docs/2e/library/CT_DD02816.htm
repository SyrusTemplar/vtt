</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Cross reference the type of attacker with the type of defending wall. The
number before the slash indicates the saving throw, rolled on 1d20, the wall needs
to resist the attack. The time period after the slash indicates the amount of
sustained attack there must be before the die is rolled; ?immediate? indicates
that the wall must save every time it is struck. For purposes of these rules,
one ?day? represents abut 10 hours of sustained bombardment. If the crews are
relieved (and they can see their targets) it is possible to perform two shifts of
bombardment every 24 hours. If more than one engine is attacking the same
section of wall, roll once for each engine. The saving throw numbers assume a wall
of average strength and thickness for its type. If the wall is unusually well
made (a dwarven fortress with exceptional stone, for example), the DM can allow a
saving throw bonus of +1 or +2. Furthermore, an exceptionally thick wall gains
a saving throw bonus of +1 for every 50% of extra thickness. A curtain wall 45
feet thick, for example, would gain a +1 saving throw bonus.
