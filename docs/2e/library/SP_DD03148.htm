<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Nonproficiency and Weapon Familiarity </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">If A character who is not proficient in a type of weapon suffers penalties on
attack rolls when using that weapon. The penalties vary by character class—for
example, fighters are much more likely to understand an unfamiliar weapon than
wizards. The penalties are shown on <A HREF="DD03149.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03149.htm">Table 50</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">: Nonproficiency Attack Penalties.
<P></P>
However, in some cases a character can be familiar enough with a weapon that
he does not suffer all nonproficiency penalties. This is called weapon
familiarity. And while the character cannot fight as effectively as someone with a
weapon proficiency, neither is he as inept as a nonproficient character.
<P></P>
A character is assumed to be familiar with weapons that are related to ones
with which he is proficient. Weapons in the same tight group as a character’s
weapon of proficiency are familiar to that character. If a character has
proficiency in an entire tight group of weapons, he is familiar with all weapons in a
related broad group.
<P></P>
A character using a weapon with which he is not proficient cannot perform any
special combat maneuvers, such as disarms or parries, with that weapon. He is
limited to basic attacks, with the die roll penalties shown above. If he hits,
however, he makes a normal roll for damage.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> A single weapon proficiency slot can be used to acquire proficiency in a
specific type of weapon. Such proficiency means that the character can wield that
weapon normally, without penalties on his rolls to hit or damage.
