Priesthoods are also restricted, usually by decree of the god himself. Below
are examples of many typical sorts of restrictions: Note that most priesthoods
will only have a <I>few </I>of these restrictions, and each faith may employ different ones.
<P></P>
Gods make these requirements of their priesthoods for four principal reasons:
Commemoration, Function, Philosophy, and Sacrifice.
<P></P>
<I>Commemoration</I> means that the action is a reminder of some important event from the history
of the faith. For example, the cross and crucifix are symbols of the
Crucifixion.
<P></P>
<I>Function</I> means that if the requirement is not met, the priest cannot for some reason
function as a priest. For instance, if, in a specific campaign world, clerical
magic will not work if the caster has consumed alcohol, then the priesthood will
have a requirement that its priests not drink.
<P></P>
<I>Philosophy</I> means that the choice is bound up with other elements of the faith. If
certain creatures are held to be unholy, unclean, or otherwise taboo, for instance,
there will be many secondary requirements derived from that thought. A priest
wouldn't be able to wear armor made from its hide or eat its meat. To be buried
in or with its skin might even result in involuntary separation from the faith!
<P></P>
<I>Sacrifice </I>means that the god requires this behavior to test the mettle of his followers.
Those who can't make the sacrifice are obviously not cut out to be his priests.
<P></P>
At his discretion, the DM can make any of these requirements apply to the
worshippers of the god in addition to the priesthood. Especially appropriate are
restrictions involving Contamination (see below).
