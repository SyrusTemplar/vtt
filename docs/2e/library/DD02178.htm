This spell enables the caster to cure most diseases by placing his hand upon
the diseased creature. The affliction rapidly disappears thereafter, making the
cured creature whole and well in from one turn to 10 days, depending on the
type of disease and the state of its advancement when the cure took place. (The DM
must adjudicate these conditions.) The spell is also effective against
parasitic monsters such as green slime, rot grubs, and others. When cast by a priest
of at least 12th level, this spell cures lycanthropy if cast within three days
of the infection. Note that the spell does not prevent reoccurrence of a disease
if the recipient is again exposed.
<P></P>
The reverse of the <I>cure disease</I> spell is <I>cause disease.</I> To be effective, the priest must touch the intended victim, and the victim
must fail a saving throw vs. spell. The severity of the disease is decided by the
priest (debilitating or fatal). The exact details of the disease are decided
by the DM, but the following are typical:
<P></P>
<I>Debilitating:</I> The disease takes effect in 1d6 turns, after which the creature loses 1 point
of Strength per hour until his Strength is reduced to 2 or less, at which time
the recipient is weak and virtually helpless. If a creature has no Strength
rating, it loses 10% of its hit points per Strength loss, down to 10% of its
original hit points. If the disease also affects hit points, use the more severe
penalty. Recovery requires a period of 1d3 weeks.
<P></P>
<I>Fatal:</I> This wasting disease is effective immediately. Infected creatures receive no
benefit from <I>cure wound</I> spells while the disease is in effect; wounds heal at only 10% of the natural
rate. The disease proves fatal within 1d6 months and can be cured only by
magical means. Each month the disease progresses, the creature loses 2 points of
Charisma, permanently.
<P></P>
The inflicted disease can be cured by the <I>cure disease</I> spell. Lycanthropy cannot be caused.
