</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Wizards and priests have developed a number of unique and valuable skills to
aid them in their pursuit of both magical and temporal power and knowledge.
Literacy in ancient languages, knowledge of the maintenance of libraries and
physical care of dilapidated old tomes, and skills in research and the execution of
laboratory tasks are absolutely indispensable to a wizard character. Similarly,
priests should be familiar with the languages in which their holiest scriptures
are written, the correct observances and customs demanded by their deity, and
the administration of property and lands belonging to their temples.
<P></P>
In this chapter, we?ll take a look at new proficiencies for the spellcasters
of the AD&amp;D game. New nonweapon proficiencies describe a number of new skills
available to both wizards and priests, ranging from alchemy to zoology. We?ll
also introduce the concept of <I>signature spells </I>or spell <I>specialization</I>, which represents unusual skill with a particular spell. Just as fighters can
master their weapons with practice and training, wizards can master their
spells.
