These gaseous monsters prey on all living creatures, enveloping them with
their gaseous tendrils, then draining their blood for food.
<P></P>
Vampiric mists appear as thick, billowing clouds, 5 to 8 feet in diameter.
Color ranges from pale pink when hungry to crimson red when sated. Vampiric mists
speak no language, but they communicate through a limited form of telepathy.
These creatures reek of old blood and are often smelled before seen.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Vampiric mists automatically sense the presence of any warm-blooded creature
within 50 feet. Hungry mists take the shortest route possible to the victim,
navigating by touch, flowing easily over water or through narrow cracks. Their
path can be blocked by nonporous obstacles, but vampiric mists are intelligent and
if any reasonable path exists they will find it.
<P></P>
All vampiric mists have maximum hit points (8 per die) when full, but they are
almost never encountered in this state. For each 12 hours a mist goes unfed,
it loses 1 hit point. Vampiric mists whose hit point totals reach 0 due to
starvation die. To regain hit points, vampiric mists must drain fresh blood from
living victims (hence the mist's name). For each 2 hit points of blood drained,
the mist regains 1 hit point.
<P></P>
A vampiric mist may attack one victim per round by reaching out with a gaseous
tendril. Targets of a vampiric mist are treated as AC 10. Modify this number
by the victim's Dexterity, and by the magical protection worn (+1, +2, etc.) but
ignore magical shields. The touch of a vampiric mist drains 1d8 points of
blood. A hit 4 above the needed to hit number means the mist has enveloped its
victim. Enveloped victims are automatically hit each round until either the mist
dies, finishes feeding, or retreats. Attacks by other characters against an
enveloping vampiric mist divide their damage evenly -- half against the mist, half
against the victim. Only the enveloped victim may attack the mist without harm
to himself, However, because of the disorienting effect of rapid blood loss,
enveloped victims may not use any spells or magical devices that require
concentration.
<P></P>
While blood draining is mainly used to feed, the ability can also be used in
defense by sated vampiric mists. Extra blood is simply dumped upon the ground.
<P></P>
Normally, a vampiric mist is damaged only by magical weapons or by spells that
effect air. <I>Lightning bolt</I> and <I>magic missile</I> are also effective. However, immediately after reaching maximum hit points a
vampiric mist takes on substance. This substantial stage last 1d6 turns. During
this time the mist's movement rate slows to 6, its AC drops to 8, and it may
be hit by normal weapons.
<P></P>
Blood draining is not a form of regeneration; a mist that loses hit points in
combat must heal those points normally. Keep track of a mist's current hit
points and its maximum possible for that combat (this total starts at 24 and goes
down with damage caused to the mist). Each time the mist is wounded, reduce both
the current hit points and the maximum. If the current hit point total ever
reaches 0, the mist dies. Hit points gained by draining blood are added to the
current hit points, which cannot exceed the maximum total (24 minus damage to the
mist). Hit points lost due to starvation are subtracted from the current hit
points only. The current hit points may never exceed the mist's maximum hit
point total. (After the current battle is over, the maximum hit point totals for
any surviving mists return to 24.)

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">These dread monsters inhabit both swamps, where they creep along mixing in
with morning and night fog, and subterranean caverns, where they stalk prey in
absolute darkness. Vampiric mists attack at night or early morning, flowing over
the ground in search of warm-blooded victims. They prefer lone victims, but
hungry mists sometimes raid towns at night, slaying livestock and draining victims
in their sleep, before slipping out at dawn.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">First thought to be immature forms of crimson death, it is now known that
these fiends were deliberately created by a powerful vampire wizard.
<P></P>
Vampiric mists reproduce by division. A mist is 10% likely to divide during
its substantial stage immediately after feeding. The two mists created have 3 Hit
Dice each, but only 4 hit points per die (thus they are born ravenously
hungry).
<P></P>
Vampiric mists prey on all warm-blooded creatures. No animals hunt vampiric
mist deliberately, though stirges, leeches, and other bloodsuckers are sometimes
drawn (fatally) to their smell. Vampiric mists have no known life span. They
live until they starve, are slain, or reproduce.
