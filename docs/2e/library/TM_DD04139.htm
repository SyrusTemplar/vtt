Priests are hardly the unglamorous and weak adventurers that they are
sometimes portrayed to be. They are an important part of any society, serving as more
than just handy doctors. Priests have great responsibilities for the defense,
guidance, welfare, and protection of a community. Because of this, their spells
reflect more diversity and application when compared with wizard spells. The <I>Tome of Magic</I> provides priests with more tools to help them achieve their goals.
