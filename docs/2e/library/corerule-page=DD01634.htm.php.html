</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> There are times when it is important to know how quickly a character can get
into or out of his armor. Accidents and unforeseen events happen all the time.
The party is attacked at night. Those sleeping around the campfire may want to
don their armor before rushing into battle. A character slips and falls into the
river where his heavy armor pulls him down like a stone. He greatly desires to
get it off before he drowns. Just how long does it take him?
<P></P>
The time required to don armor depends on its make. Those armors that are a
single piece--leather tunics, robes, chain mail--take one round (two for metal
items) to don with slight assistance. Without aid, the time is doubled. Armor
that is made of separate pieces require 1d6 + 4 rounds, again with assistance.
Without help, the time required is tripled. In all cases, the times given assume
that the proper undergarments and padding are also worn.
<P></P>
Sometimes characters need to get into armor in a hurry and thus, they dress
hastily. This assumes that some buckles aren't fastened, seatings adjusted, etc.
Single suits can be hastily donned in one round at the cost of 1 worse AC
(though never worse than 8). Thus, a fighter could hastily pull on his brigandine
jack (AC 6) and charge into a fray with an AC of 7. Hastily donning piece armor
(plate mail for example) improves the character's AC by 1 (from a base of 10)
for every round spent dressing. A fighter could choose to spend three rounds
fitting on parts of his plate mail, giving him an AC of 7, before going into battle.
<P></P>
Removing armor is a much quicker matter. Most can be shed in a single round.
Piece armor (particularly full plate) requires 1d4 + 1 rounds. However, if the
character is willing to cut straps and bend pins, such armors can be removed in
half the time (roll 1d4 + 1, divide by 2, then round fractions up).
