Thieves are perhaps the most fascinating and diverse class of
player-characters in the AD&amp;D? game?or at least they can be, if played properly. The thief has
a certain innate, charming flair, which the <I>Player's Handbook </I>describes: &quot;Thieves are people who feel that the world (and everyone in it)
somehow owes them a living. They get by day by day, living in the highest style
they can afford and doing as little work as possible . . .&quot;
<P></P>
This is an accurate description of many thieves, but not all; and there are
many exceptions. You will find that the character?that is, the personality?of
your thief character will be very important, vital to making the thief a living,
breathing person. It makes them more fun to play, too.
<P></P>
Personality, then, is the topic of this chapter. It comes before the chapters
of technical information on kits, new abilities and so forth, because we
believe that when you are designing a thief character, perhaps even more so than with
other classes, personality considerations should come first. Who is this
character? Where is he from? Why is he a thief?has he stolen bread crumbs all his
life just to survive, or is he an idle fop who moonlights as a burglar just for
thrills?
<P></P>
After asking yourself such questions, and answering them, you will then be
better able to proceed into the technical details. Your character will exist in
your mind, and the task will then be just a matter of translating that vision
into working game terms.
<P></P>
There are three basic things to consider when putting together your thief's
background and personality: setting, social background, and motivations.
