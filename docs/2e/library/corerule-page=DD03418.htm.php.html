Dealing with Game-Breaking Characters
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> While the customized wizard rules allow players a great deal of flexibility in
creating their characters, they also allow a clever player to put together a
“super-wizard” by carefully selecting limitations that he thinks will rarely
hinder the character. Don’t despair; this is a zero-sum character creation system,
and for every strength a character must also incorporate a corresponding
weakness. Here are a few guidelines for handling high-powered characters:
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM’s Prerogative: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The DM always has the final say on anything in his campaign. If a player
insists on building characters that unbalance the game, the DM is within his rights
to simply not approve the character or disallow customized character creation
in his game.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Point Limits: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The DM can limit the number of additional powers purchased by a wizard by
setting a limit of 60 or 70 points of optional abilities. After the first 40
points, each additional ability must still be paid for by taking limitations. This
prevents a player from building a wizard with every ability on the list and
balancing it with every limitation. Optionally, the DM can require that a wizard
spend at least 30 points acquiring schools to cast spells from, or set other
spending limits in specific areas.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Limitations with a Vengeance: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A player might think he’s getting away with something when he takes a couple
of belief or environmental condition limitations, but a good DM can always find
a way to bring these role-playing disadvantages into play. By looking for
situations where the super-character’s built-in weaknesses cripple him, the DM can
graphically illustrate how out of balance the character actually is.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>The Bad Guys are Supermen, Too: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Naturally, if one character is a walking arsenal of powers and abilities, it
stands to reason that some NPCs might have similar skills. No matter how tough a
particular PC is, there’s always someone in the game world who’s a little
tougher than him, and meeting that NPC is a super-character’s worst nightmare.
While this tactic isn’t particularly elegant, it’s quite effective in letting the
player know just how it feels to be in the place of the poor NPCs his
character’s been terrorizing.
