Polearms (and any other weapons with long staff-like elements—quarterstaves,
lances, spears, etc.) are good weapons to have when you're trying the Pull/Trip
maneuver.
<P></P>
You can Pull/Trip someone at the maximum range of your weapon, for instance,
with no additional penalty to attack rolls.
<P></P>
You can Pull/Trip moving animals with a polearm; this is at a –6 penalty to
attack rolls if the animal is Large (but you can't even try it on a Large animal <I>without</I> a pole of some sort).
<P></P>
And, finally, they are very useful for knocking riders off their mounts. With
a mancatcher or polearm (though not with a quarterstaff, lance or spear), you
can attack a mounted rider and have a good chance of pulling him from his horse.
The Dexterity modifiers listed above also apply to the rider's chance to stay
mounted.
