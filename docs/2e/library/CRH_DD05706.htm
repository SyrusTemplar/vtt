?? Players choose character kits for their rangers as part of the character
creation process. Only one kit can be chosen for a particular ranger.
<P></P>
?? When creating a new ranger, begin by determining his ability scores (<I>Player's Handbook</I>, Chapter 1), race (<I>PH</I>, Chapter 2) and alignment (<I>PH</I>, Chapter 4). At this point, select a character kit, recording the pertinent
information on the character sheet (the record sheets at the end of this book
are designed for character kits; permission is granted to copy these pages for
personal use). In accordance with the kit information, flesh out the character by
determining other relevant details, such as character proficiencies (<I>PH</I>, Chapter 5; and Chapter 5 of this book) and equipment (<I>PH</I>, Chapter 6; and Chapter 7 of this book).

?? A player chooses a character kit at the outset of his ranger's career. It's
possible, however, to incorporate the character kit rules into an existing
campaign, providing the DM agrees that the kit is appropriate. A kit must be
compatible with a ranger's personal history, his background, and his established
personality traits. For example, the Mountain Man kit doesn't make sense for a ranger
who's never been to the mountains. On the other hand, the Sea Ranger kit is a
logical choice for a ranger who's spent most of his life at sea.
