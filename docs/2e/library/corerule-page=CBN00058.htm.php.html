</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">With this ability, a necromancer can immediately stupefy and cloud the mind
any single living creature under his or her regard. If the subject fails a saving
throw vs. spells (at a –4 penalty), he or she feels a profound form of
lethargy and disorientation, similar in effect to a <I>slow</I> spell, except that the condition lasts for up to one turn per level of the
wizard. The necromancer may call upon this power once per round, at will, and can
also break its effect at any time (it can also be terminated prematurely by a
successful<I> dispel magic</I>).
