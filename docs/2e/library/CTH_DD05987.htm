These actually come in different shapes and sizes, but the basic form is that
of a metal ball with four to six spikes or prongs set into it. When a caltrop
is thrown to the ground it always lands with one spike standing more or less
upright. A thief may throw small caltrops to the ground to slow down pursuers.
Caltrops cannot be used as missile weapons, however.
<P></P>
The effect of caltrops depends on how many are thrown down by the thief. The
base number is 10 thrown down in an area of 25 square feet. Anyone entering the
area must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation. A successful save means that
the character has stepped on one, suffering 1d4 points of damage, and must halt
movement. If half the number of caltrops is used (only five in a 25-foot area),
the save is made at +4; for every extra five dropped in such an area, the save
is made at an additional -2 (up to -6 in total). A character moving at less
than one-third his normal movement rate doesn't need to make a save. A fresh
saving throw must be made for each 5-foot section entered in which caltrops have
been dropped.
<P></P>
If a pursuer steps on a caltrop, it must be removed before the pursuer can
continue. This takes one round. Also, the pursuer must make a second save vs.
paralyzation to see if he is temporarily lamed. If the save is made, pursuit can
continue normally. If the save is failed, the pursuer can only move at one-third
normal rate for 24 hours (or until the damage is magically healed).
<P></P>
An ingenious thief can even improvise caltrops?in one infamous instance, from
a sack of potatoes found in the kitchen of a house being burgled and a small
bag of nails carried by the thief in question. Modifiers to the saving throws of
potential victims can be allowed for such improvised versions!

Note: For players and DMs with <I>Unearthed Arcana</I>, the rules above are based on the entry for tetsu-bishi in <I>Oriental Adventures</I>, which has somewhat superior rules to those in the <I>Unearthed Arcana</I> entry for caltrops.
