<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Local History:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The character is a storehouse of facts about the history of a region the size
of a large county or a small province. The character knows when the ruined
tower on the hill was built and who built it (and what happened to him), what great
heroes and villains fought and fell at the old battlefield, what great
treasure is supposed to be kept in a local temple, how the mayor of the next town
miraculously grew hair on his balding pate, and more.

The DM will provide information about local sites and events as the character
needs to know them. Furthermore, the character can try to retell these events
as entertaining stories. Once the subject is chosen, he can either make a
proficiency check and, if successful, add that tale to his repertoire, or actually
tell the story to other characters. If the character succeeds in entertaining
them, the player need not make a proficiency roll for the character, since he has
succeeded. The character can tell these stories to entertain others, granting
him a +2 bonus to his Charisma for the encounter. But telling stories to hostile
beings is probably not going to do any good.
