<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">More About Ability Checks</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> One problem with ability checks as they now stand follows:
<P></P>
-Leon, see if your 17 Muscle fighter can lift that iron chest.?
<P></P>
<I>(Rolling a d20)</I> -Missed it. I rolled a 19.?
<P></P>
-Tomas, check if your 6 Muscle wizard can do it.?
<P></P>
-Yes!-I made it with a 4!?
<P></P>
<P></P>
The above reflects that sometimes a character with a high score will fail,
only to have a character with a lower score get lucky and succeed. Depending on
the number of points in each subability score, the character can make additional
attempts at feats. The rule is: for each point in a subability above 15, the
player can roll an additional 1d20 for checks against that subability. For
example, because Leon-s fighter has a 17 Muscle, the character can make up to three
checks-the initial check, plus two more. So if Leon-s fighter wants to force
open a trap door, Leon rolls 3d20. If any of the dice register a successful check,
the fighter opens the door. Tomas? character, with a 6 Muscle only rolls 1d20.
<P></P>
This multiple d20 system does not eliminate the possibility of a character
with a low ability score succeeding where a character with a higher ability score
fails. But the system does reduce the number of times such an improbable
incident will occur.
<P></P>

<A NAME="5e5c0e96"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Heightened Difficulties</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> An additional benefit of this system is that the DM can set particularly
difficult checks for characters with high ability scores-requiring two or more
successes on the characters? multiple d20 rolls.
<P></P>
For example, if the iron chest Leon-s fighter wants to lift had been welded in
place, the DM could claim that two or even all three of the fighter-s d20
rolls be successful for the chest to come free. This further reinforces the idea
that characters with low scores are not as capable as their comrades with higher
scores.
<P></P>
For those occasions when a lone adventurer cannot succeed at an ability check
due to insufficient dice, additional characters might be able to help. If the
DM rules that more than one character can attempt the feat, roll the d20s of the
character with the highest ability score, then add 1d20 for each additional
character assisting the primary character.
<P></P>
This system also can be used to determine the outcome of direct
ability-vs.-ability contests between characters. The winner of such a contest is the one who
successfully rolls the highest result-if that result is equal to or under the
ability score in question. For example, if two characters with 14 Aim scores
compete to see who can hit a far-off boulder with thrown stones-and the results of
the d20 rolls are a 14 and a 6-the character who rolled the 14 wins the
contest and strikes the boulder first. Both characters? rolls succeeded, but the 14
is a higher degree of success than the 6. If the character with the 14 result
had instead rolled a 15 or a 5, the other competitor would have won, in the first
case because 15 is not a successful Aim check, and in the second because a 6
is higher than a 5.
<P></P>
Another common example of such a contest is an arm-wrestling match. Marshall
has a ranger with a Strength of 15 and subability scores of Stamina 13 and
Muscle 17. Brian has a fighter with a Strength of 13 and subability scores of 13 in
both Stamina and Muscle. These characters decide to arm wrestle to see who gets
the first choice of treasure. The first ability check would be against Muscle
to see if either character could overwhelm the other with a burst of Strength.
Marshall and Brian roll 1d20, and both Muscle check results are 11. The
characters have matched power for power.
<P></P>
The next check (and all subsequent checks) would be against Stamina to see
which character tires first. Marshall rolls a 7 and Brian rolls a 12. Both are
successes, but Brian-s roll was higher. Brian-s character wins the arm-wrestling
match despite having lower Strength and Muscle scores. Simply put, Brian-s
character got lucky, and the next match between the characters could turn out
differently.

abilities of rogues. Characters with high Balance scores may, by the numbers, seem to
be better at thieving skills than some rogues, especially low-level ones. DMs
should take care not to let nonrogue characters steal the spotlight away from
the real rogues. The climb walls ability is a good example. Most characters with
above average Balance scores would have a relatively simple time climbing a
craggy rock face or cliff, but only thieves can climb brick walls or sheer
surfaces.
<P></P>
DMs who wish to grant characters with high ability scores some chance of
success at feats similar to thieving abilities could require multiple successes for
such characters to succeed.
