The plains druid lives on open grasslands with few or no trees: temperate
prairies and pampas, hot veldts and savannas, cool steppes, and the like. Yalla is
such a druid. (See illustration next page.) She often finds herself in the
company of nomadic hunters and herders. Her powers and interests resemble those of
a forest druid, but she has a closer interest in the weather and the health of
great herds roaming her lands than in trees and crops. Second only to the
forest branch, plains druids remain among the most common and best known of all
druids.
