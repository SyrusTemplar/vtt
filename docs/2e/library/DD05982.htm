These were not considered earlier under the pick locks skill because the DM
will almost certainly wish to restrict the availability of these items
drastically, if they are allowed in the campaign world at all.
<P></P>
A skeleton key is one which is capable of opening many locks of several
different types, in its most versatile form. The very best designs will open
virtually any lock, but it is certain that the DM will not want any PC thief acquiring
such an item! Rather, four ways of dealing with skeleton keys are suggested
here.
<P></P>
First, any individual skeleton key may open locks of up to a certain
complexity level. Skeleton keys may be of good, excellent, or superior quality (wretched
and poor don't warrant them), and a skeleton key of any particular level of
quality can open all locks with a quality the same as, or lower than, that of the
skeleton key itself.
<P></P>
Second, a skeleton key can be treated as being equivalent to a thief of a
certain level; this can be determined by the DM to suit the level of play in the
campaign world. If a purely random determination is required, level 7-14 (6+d8)
may be used. The open locks chance can be taken as 20%, plus 5% per thief level.
<P></P>
Third, a skeleton key can be treated as a &quot;master key&quot;?that is, it can open
all the locks in some particular area (such as all the non-residential rooms in
the east wing of the vampire's castle). In this instance it is really only a
glorified substitute for a bunch of keys, although it saves time having just one
key to use. A more interesting variant on this theme is to have a skeleton key
which can open all the locks commissioned from a particular locksmith (in the
last few years, perhaps). If the locksmith was well thought of and often hired,
there could be adventures built around just finding out which locations he had
built the locks for, let alone going around opening them all!
<P></P>
Fourth, a skeleton key can be rated as a minor magical item, and removed from
the realm of mundane equipment, if the DM wishes to restrict the availability
of such a key without banishing it from game play. In this case, rating the key
as equal in skill to a high-level thief and/or adding major bonuses to pick
locks skill for locks up to masterful quality is the best way to use the key.
<P></P>
Finally, note that a skeleton key may open a particular lock, but it does not
disarm any trap(s) attached to the lock or portal unless the original key would
do so.
