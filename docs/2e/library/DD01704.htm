<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="5">Punching and Wrestling
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> These are the most basic of combat skills, unknowingly practiced by almost all
children as they rough and tumble with each other. Thus, all characters,
regardless of class, are assumed to be somewhat proficient in both these forms of
fighting.
<P></P>
Punching occurs when a character attacks with his fists. No weapons are used,
although the character can wear an iron gauntlet or similar item. Wrestling
requires both hands free, unencumbered by shields and the like.
<P></P>
When punching or wrestling, a normal attack roll is made. The normal Armor
Class of the target is used. If a character is attempting to wrestle in armor, the
modifiers on <A HREF="DD01705.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01705.htm">Table 57</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> are used (these are penalties to the attacker's attack roll). Normal
modifiers to the attack roll are also applied.
<P></P>
Penalties for being held or attacking a held opponent do not apply to
wrestlers. Wrestling involves a lot of holding and twisting as it is, and the damage
resolution system for punching and wrestling takes this into account.
<P></P>
If the attack roll is successful, consult <A HREF="DD01706.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01706.htm">Table 58</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> to find the result of the attack: Cross-index the character's modified attack
roll with the proper attack form. If, for example, a character successfully
punched with an 18, the result would be a rabbit punch (if he rolled an 18 on a
successful wrestling attempt, the result would be a kick). Punching and
wrestling attacks <I>can</I> succeed on attack rolls of 1 or less (exceptions to the general rule).
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Punch:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This is the type of blow landed. In game terms, the type of blow has little
effect, but using the names adds spice to the battle and makes the DM's job of
describing the action easier.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Damage:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Bare-handed attacks cause only 1 or 2 points of damage. Metal gauntlets, brass
knuckles, and the like cause 1d3 points of damage. A character's Strength
bonus, if any, <I>does</I> apply to punching attacks.
<P></P>
Punching damage is handled a little differently than normal damage. Only 25%
of the damage caused by a bare-handed attack is normal damage. The remaining 75%
is temporary. For the sake of convenience, record punching damage separately
from other damage and calculate the percentage split at the end of all combat.
<P></P>
If a character reaches 0 hit points due to punching attacks (or any
combination of punching and normal attacks), he immediately falls unconscious.
<P></P>
A character can voluntarily pull his punch, not causing <I>any</I> hit point damage, provided he says so before the damage is applied to his
enemy. There is still a chance of a knockout.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>% K.O.:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Although a punch does very little damage, there is a chance of knocking an
opponent out. This chance is listed on the <A HREF="DD01706.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01706.htm">table</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> as “% K.O.” If this number or less is rolled on percentile dice, the victim
is stunned for 1d10 rounds.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wrestle:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This lists the action or type of grip the character managed to get. Wrestling
moves marked with an asterisk (*) are holds maintained from round to round,
unless they are broken. A hold is broken by a throw, a gouge, the assistance of
another person, or the successful use of a weapon. (Penalties to the attack roll
apply to weapon attacks by a character who is in a hold.)
<P></P>
All wrestling moves inflict 1 point of damage plus Strength bonus (if the
attacker desires), while continued holds cause cumulatively 1 more point of damage
for each round they are held. A head lock held for six rounds would inflict 21
points of damage total (1+2+3+4+5+6). Remember, this is the equivalent of
pressing hard on a full-nelson headlock for roughly six minutes!
