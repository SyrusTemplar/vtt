<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Ring of Armoring:</B> A wizard wearing this ring gains an additional +1 bonus to any AC bonus he
receives from casting a spell upon himself. Thus, an armor spell grants the
wizard AC 5 instead of AC 6, and a <I>shield</I> spell grants the wizard AC 1 versus hand-hurled missiles instead of AC 2.
Restrictions that apply to a spell (for example, <I>armor</I> does not affect a character already wearing armor) are in no way altered
through use of this ring.
