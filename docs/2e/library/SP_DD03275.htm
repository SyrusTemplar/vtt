With this power, the user can reach into another plane, grab whatever creature
he happens to find there, and teleport it to his own plane. The creature is
disoriented for 1 round after arriving, suffering a ?2 penalty on all die rolls
for initiative, attacks, and saving throws. The user can make the summoned
creature appear anywhere within 200 yards of his position. If the user rolls the MAC
number exactly, the creature appears within 10 yards. The PSP cost is 40 for a
creature from the Astral or Ethereal Planes, 80 for one from the Inner or
Outer Planes. Failure costs half the indicated PSPs.
<P></P>
The user chooses the plane from which the creature will come. He doesn-t
choose the creature, however; that-s determined at random. A creature from the
Elemental Planes is usually an elemental of the appropriate type. A creature from
the Outer Planes could be a native or a visitor. DMs are encouraged to see the
Planescape? line for ideas.
<P></P>
This power offers no control over the summoned creature and doesn-t return it
to its home plane after a set amount of time-it merely teleports something from
there to here. To be rid of the creature, the user must banish it, teleport it
again, kill it, or somehow control it.
