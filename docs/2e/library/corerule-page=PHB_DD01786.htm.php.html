<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Although it is possible to perform other actions while climbing, such as
spellcasting or fighting, it is not easy. Spellcasters can use spells only if they
are in a steady, braced position, perhaps with the aid of other characters.
<P></P>
Climbing characters lose all Armor Class bonuses for Dexterity and shield and
most often have rear attack modifiers applied against them also. Their own
attack, damage, and saving throw rolls suffer -2 penalties. Those attacking from
above gain a +2 bonus to their attack rolls, while those attacking from below
suffer an additional -2 penalty to their attack rolls.
<P></P>
A climbing character cannot use a two-handed weapon while climbing. The DM can
overrule these penalties if he feels the player character has reached a place
of secure footing. If struck while climbing (for any amount of damage), the
character must make an immediate Climbing check. Failure for a roped character
means he spends a round regaining his balance; an unroped character falls if he
fails this check.
