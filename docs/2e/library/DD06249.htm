This spell creates a ju-ju zombie duplicate of the caster. The <I>zombie double</I> has the same memories, consciousness, and alignment as the caster;
essentially, the caster now exists in two bodies simultaneously. In all other respects,
the <I>zombie double</I> is the same as a normal ju-ju zombie (AC 6; MV 9; HD 3+12; #AT 1; Dmg 3-12;
SA strike as a 6 HD monster; SD immune to all mind-affecting spells, including
illusions; immune to <I>sleep, charm, hold, death magic, magic missiles,</I> electricity, poisons,<I> </I>and cold-based spells; edged and cleaving weapons inflict normal damage while
blunt and piercing weapons inflict half- damage; magical and normal fire
inflicts half-damage); THAC0 16.
<P></P>
The<I> zombie double</I> cannot cast spells, but it can use any weapons that the caster can use. It is
also able to climb walls as a thief (92 percent). The <I>zombie double</I> can be turned as a spectre. If it strays more than 30 yards from the caster,
the<I> zombie double</I> becomes inactive and collapses to the ground; it becomes active again the
instant the caster moves within 30 yards.

The material components for this spell are a bit of wax from a black candle
and a lock of hair from the caster
