This spell prevents monsters of 2 or fewer Hit Dice from entering the area of
effect. Such creatures are allowed a saving throw; success indicates that they
avoid the spell's effects and are able to enter the area of effect.
<P></P>
The spell affects a cubic area whose sides equal the caster's level times 10
feet (for example, a 9th-level caster could affect an area equal to a 90' x 90'x
90' cube).
<P></P>
Monsters within the area of effect when the spell is cast are not affected;
however, when they leave the area of effect, they cannot return. Monsters outside
the area of effect can hurl rocks, spears, and other missile weapons at
targets inside and can also cast spells into the warded area.
<P></P>
The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a pinch of salt.
