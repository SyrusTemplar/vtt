This power allows the user to sharpen all his normal senses: sight, hearing,
taste, smell, and touch. (DMs might allow other applications as they see fit.)
With heightened senses, the user has a good chance to notice thieves hiding in
shadows or moving silently. This is represented by a thief’s skill chance being
cut in half if someone with heightened senses is observing him. Even if the
thief is already hidden, he must roll again when the user of this power enters the
area.

Someone with heightened senses can also track by sense of smell. He must make
an Intelligence check every turn to stay on the trail or to recover it if he
loses it. While tracking, the user’s movement rate is reduced by 50%. The trail
can be no more than 24 hours old. Ranges for the user’s hearing and seeing are
tripled while this power is in effect. Further, he can ingest small quantities
of possibly poisoned or impure foods, identifying the substance without causing
himself harm. The user can identify almost anything by touch. He can identify
any item he has previously handled and can also tell if an item was handled in
the last five minutes.
