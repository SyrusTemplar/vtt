The Sphere of Thought is rooted in the philosophy of mentation and the effects
of mental acts and structures on reality. Priests of this sphere believe that
the common conception of the thought (i.e., a more-or-less objective analysis
of sensory input which is in turn an objective perception of reality) is
fallacious and misleading. These philosophers maintain that thought is and must be
tied closely to reality. In effect, they believe that the thinker, the thought,
and the subject of that thought somehow interact. Thus, thinking about an object
or condition can sometimes cause a physical change in that object or condition.
<P></P>
Philosophers of this sphere also believe that once a thought has been created
(&quot;once a thought is thought&quot;), it exists as a &quot;freestanding mental object.&quot;
This &quot;thought object&quot; can sometimes be detected and manipulated.

This sphere uses spells related to these philosophical beliefs. Like the
Sphere of Numbers, these spells are intricate and are based on some esoteric
concepts of philosophy. It is suggested that only priests with relatively high
intelligence (13 or higher) be allowed access to these spells.

Spells of this sphere are most likely to be granted by deities of thought or
knowledge (especially arcane or hidden knowledge). This sphere might have as its
patrons certain deities who rule and exist in the abstract realms of thought.
Certain isolated philosophers discuss the existence of a deity of solipsism
(the philosophical belief that only the self exists). Since such a deity would
believe that it exists alone in the universe, it would have no worshipers.
