fashion. Most puzzles involve logic, memory, or creativity. The riddle game
included in J.R.R. Tolkien’s novel, <I>The Hobbit</I>, represents one kind of puzzle encounter.
<P></P>
Puzzles are an excellent way to make players rely on themselves rather than on
their characters’ abilities. The best puzzles fit your game’s atmosphere; word
plays on pop music lyrics or Disney movie titles aren’t a good approach to
puzzle making unless you are playing the adventure for laughs.
<P></P>
You can add some tension to a puzzle encounter by combining it with a trap—the
characters suffer damage or a magical effect if they give an incorrect
response—or guardian—which attacks if the correct answer is not provided.
