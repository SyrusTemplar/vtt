Following the discovery of wild magic came the discovery of wild surges and
the personal danger such surges create. After several wild mages destroyed
themselves by rather spectacular means (or suffered very odd side effects), the <I>chaos shield</I> was created as protection from these surges.
<P></P>
This spell imbues the wild mage with special protection against the effects of
wild surges. It protects only against wild surges caused by the caster's own
spells, not from the effects of another mage's wild surges.
<P></P>
When a wild surge affects a caster protected by <I>chaos shield</I>, he is allowed a saving throw vs. magic. If the saving throw is successful,
the effect of the surge on the caster is negated. If the saving throw is failed,
the caster is affected normally by the surge. The spell does not protect
against wild surges that might be caused by its own casting.
<P></P>
The <I>chaos shield</I> protects only the caster and does not negate the effects of a wild surge for
other characters who might be in the area of effect. The caster cannot
voluntarily cancel the protection once he has learned the nature of a wild surge; the <I>chaos shield</I> protects from both good and harmful effects. Thus, if a wild surge resulted
in a <I>heal</I> spell for all characters within 10 feet of the caster, the protected caster
might not benefit, while all others in the radius would be<I> healed</I>.
<P></P>
The spell remains in effect until it negates a wild surge or the spell
duration expires.
