When this spell is cast, a strong puff of air originates from the wizard and
moves in the direction he is facing. The force of this gust of wind (about 30
m.p.h.) is sufficient to extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected
flames. It causes protected flames--such as those of lanterns--to dance wildly and
has a 5% chance per level of experience of the spellcaster to extinguish even
such lights. It also fans large fires outward 1d6 feet in the direction of the
wind's movement. It forces back small flying creatures 1d6 x 10 yards and
causes man-sized beings to be held motionless if attempting to move against its
force. It slows larger-than-man-sized flying creatures by 50% for one round. It
blows over light objects, disperses most vapors, and forces away gaseous or
unsecured levitating creatures. Its path is a constant 10 feet wide, by 10 yards long
per level of experience of the caster (for example, an 8th-level wizard causes
a gust of wind that travels 80 yards).

The material component of the spell is a legume seed.
