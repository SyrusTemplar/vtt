The great Hornung, having been blasted more than once by his own wild surges,
devised a method of improving the results of wild magic and, not incidentally,
his own chances of survival. The result was <I>Hornung's surge selector</I>.
<P></P>
By casting this spell, the wild mage gains greater control over wild surges.
When the caster's spell creates a wild surge, two separate results are
determined from <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD04136.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD04136.htm.php.html">Table 2</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">. The caster can then choose which of the two results will take effect. This
spell can be used in conjunction with<I> Nahal's reckless dweomer.</I>
<P></P>
The spell's duration is a fixed number of surges or 12 hours, whichever comes
first. The wild mage is able to shape one wild surge per five levels of his
experience; thus, a 15th-level caster could shape three wild surges within a
12-hour period. At the end of 12 hours, the spell expires, regardless of the number
of surges remaining.

The material component is a brass spinner.
