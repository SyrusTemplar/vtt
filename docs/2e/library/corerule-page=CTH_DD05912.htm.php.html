<FONT SIZE="3">The base percentage of thieves who will be members of
the thieves' guild is 75%. The following modifiers are applied to
this number:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">+10% if social alignment is lawful</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">-20% is social alignment is chaotic</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">+10% if the attitude of law is persecutory</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">+10% if merchants are submissive or infiltrated</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">+10% (+5%) if guild rulership is strong (fairly strong)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">-10% (-5%) if guild rulership is weak</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">(fairly weak)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">What of the other thieves (assuming there are any)?
What is the attitude of the guild to the residual freelancers? Table
16 gives a die roll for determining this attitude, which may also be
taken to reflect the guild's attitude to outsiders who stray onto its
patch. Thus, a guild which is punitive to indigenous non-guildmembers
(&quot;join up or we'll cut your hands off&quot;) will likely be
hostile to outsiders as well.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3">Hostility means that the guildmembers will make it
very clear to a non-guildmember working in the guild's territory that
he isn't welcome. They may rough up the offender, send him
threatening messages, play an unpleasant and only half-joking
practical joke on him, and the like. The message is, join up (or get
out of town), or else. If Persecution is added to this, the offender
will be given an even starker choice: Join up or die. Neutrality
means that the guildmembers may try to persuade non-guildmembers to
join up, but they will tend to stress the benefits to all concerned
rather than using threats. A determined freelancer will probably be
left to go his own way by such thieves, but they will certainly not
assist him or have any fellow-feeling for him. The guild will not
sell equipment or offer training to the freelancer, except perhaps at
exorbitant prices. If a guild is neutral to foreign thieves, it may
allow them to work on the guild's patch providing that only
small-scale operations are involved and a fee is paid to the guild.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Cooperation suggests that freelancers may work with
the guildmembers, maybe on a special-case basis. The guild may take
the attitude that if these people won't join, it's better to keep
them friendly. Equipment and training is charged at a premium,
though. Special Relationship suggests some unusually close link
between guildmembers and outsiders. The example of the Thieves' Guild
of Mallain gives an example of how this can be scripted by the DM.</FONT></P>
