Wizards who concentrate their efforts in one school of magic are known as
specialist wizards. Generally, a specialist wizard must give up some degree of
versatility in spell selection—he cannot learn or cast spells belonging to schools
that oppose his own chosen school. The specialist also has several other
benefits and restrictions; unless otherwise stated, all specialists must abide by the
benefits and hindrances described below:
<P></P>
<P></P>
Specialist wizards may memorize one additional spell per spell level, provided
the spell selected belongs to the specialist’s school. Under this rule, a
1st-level specialist may have two spells memorized instead of only one.
<P></P>
Specialists gain a bonus of +1 when making saving throws against spells of
their own school. Specialists also inflict a –1 penalty to their victims’ saving
throw attempts when casting a spell of their specialty school.
<P></P>
Specialist wizards gain a bonus of +15% when learning spells from their
school, but suffer a penalty of –15% when learning spells from any other school.
Specialists cannot learn spells belonging to an opposition school.
<P></P>
When a specialist reaches a new level, he automatically gains one spell of his
school to add to his spell book. No roll for learning the spell need be made.
<P></P>
When a specialist wizard attempts to create a new spell through research, the
spell is treated as if it were one level lower if it falls within the wizard’s
specialty school.
