This spell temporarily calms a chaotic situation involving a group of people.
The situation may involve any range of emotions from violence (as in a barroom
brawl) to joy and merrymaking (as in a festival or carnival).
<P></P>
Unlike the <I>emotion</I> spell, <I>calm chaos</I> does not cause a change in the emotions of affected creatures--anger, fear,
or intense joy remain in each individual. The emotion is simply restrained
rather than released. Thus, an angry character intent on attacking someone will
still feel the desire to do so, but he will withhold his action as long as the
spell remains in effect.
<P></P>
Creatures to be affected are allowed a saving throw vs. spell at a -4 penalty
to avoid the effects. If more creatures are present than can be affected,
creatures nearest the caster are affected first.
<P></P>
After casting the spell, the priest makes a Charisma check. If successful, all
characters affected by the spell are compelled to stop what they are doing.
They are filled with the sensation that something important is about to occur. At
this time, the priest or a character of his choosing must gain the attention
of the affected creatures by giving a speech, performing for the crowd, or
casting spells with intriguing visual effects (such as <I>dancing lights</I>). The attention of the crowd is then held for as long as the distraction
continues. A character could filibuster and maintain control over the affected
characters for hours or days.
<P></P>
Two conditions will cause the group to resume its original actions. In the
first, the method of entertaining the crowd ceases for one round--the speech ends
or the spell expires. If this action is not replaced with another distraction
within one round, the crowd is freed of the spell.
<P></P>
In the second condition, if an event occurs that is more immediate than the
distraction, the crowd will divert its attention to that event. Thus, if the
spell were used to stop a barroom brawl and the building caught fire or was
attacked, the crowd's attention would be diverted and the individuals could act freely.
<P></P>
Creatures whose attention is held by the spell cannot be instructed to attack
or perform any action. Such creatures will ignore suggestions of this nature.
Depending on the nature of the request, the DM may deem that the suggestion
causes a distraction that ends the spell.
