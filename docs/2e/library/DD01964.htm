By means of this spell, the wizard is able to memorize, or retain the memory
of, three additional spell levels (three 1st-level spells, or one 1st and one
2nd, or one 3rd-level spell). The wizard has two options:
<P></P>
A) Memorize additional spells. This option is taken at the time the spell is
cast. The additional spells must be memorized normally and any material
components must be acquired.
<P></P>
B) Retain memory of any spell (within the level limits) cast the round prior
to starting to cast this spell. The round after a spell is cast, the enhancer
must be successfully cast. This restores the previously cast spell to memory.
However, the caster still must acquire any needed material components.
<P></P>
The material components of the spell are a piece of string, an ivory plaque of
at least 100 gp value, and ink consisting of squid secretion with either black
dragon's blood or giant slug digestive juice. These disappear when the spell
is cast.
