The <I>ward matrix</I> spell links as many as six locations within the Prime Material plane. Only
locations that have a functioning Wards spell may be linked. <I>Ward matrix</I> conjoins the different Wards spells so that each linked site gains the
protection of all other wards in the network.
<P></P>
From the place where the <I>ward matrix</I> is cast, magical connections spread to the other designated sites. These can
be seen with a <I>true seeing</I> or similar spell as tendrils of magical energy running through the air just
above ground level. The connections target their destinations and move toward
them at a rate of 40 miles per turn. They can evade barriers such as <I>anti-magic shells</I> by moving above or around them. When the connections reach their
destinations, they multiply and spread to connect all other locations in the network; this
secondary linkage is established at a rate of 20 miles per turn.
<P></P>
The conjoining of Wards lasts for 60 days unless a linked area is destroyed or
a Wards spell is dispelled. Any location that is destroyed or has its Wards
spell dispelled is removed from the matrix; other connections remain intact for
the duration.
