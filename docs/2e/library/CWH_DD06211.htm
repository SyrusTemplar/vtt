<B>Cantrip</B>
<P></P>
The simple effects created by cantrips have unlimited potential in the hands
of a clever caster. Some examples:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> A wizard is resting in an inn when he is awakened by the sound of a burglar
entering through the window. The wizard casts <I>cantrip</I> to create wracking moans and cries emanating from inside a closet. Believing
the room to be haunted, the terrified burglar may flee.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> A wizard is searching a dark castle when he discovers a dusty book lying on a
desk. He remembers that similar books were trapped to explode in a ball of fire
when touched; such books were marked with a skull on the front cover. The
wizard casts <I>cantrip</I>, creating a small breeze to blow the dust away from the book, revealing the
skull on the cover.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> A wizard traveling through a jungle is accosted by a band of cannibals. The
wizard casts <I>cantrip </I>to create a puff of colored smoke. The intimidated cannibals, suspecting that
the wizard wields powerful magic, decide to leave him alone.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The companion of a wizard is about to engage a dangerous opponent in a duel.
The wizard casts <I>cantrip</I> to cause a slight itch on the opponent's face. The opponent is distracted,
giving the wizard's companion a momentary advantage.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> A menacing warrior stands before the party. The wizard casts <I>cantrip</I> to create a banana peel in front of the warrior. The warrior takes one step
and falls on his face.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Enlarge
<P></P>
</B>Much is made in the spell description in the <I>Player's Handbook</I> of changing the size of creatures, but wizards often overlook the usefulness
of enlarge to change the size of objects. For instance, if the party is being
pursued through a narrow passage or hallway, casting <I>enlarge</I> on a stone or other object behind the party can effectively block the passage
and prevent the enemy's advancement. Similarly, if the party is faced with a
locked or stuck door, the reverse spell, <I>reduce</I>, might be able to shrink the door just enough to allow the party to get
through.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Mending</B>
<P></P>
In addition to the uses for mending listed in the spell description, this
spell can also be used to repair a leaky boat, a torn document, a broken wagon
axle, or a cut rope (but it won't link the ends of two different ropes to make a
single rope).
