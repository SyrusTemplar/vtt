<B>Beastmask </B>(Illusion/Phantasm)
<P></P>
<P></P>
Sphere: Animal
<P></P>
Range: Touch
<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>
Duration: 12 hours
<P></P>
Casting Time: 4
<P></P>
Area of Effect: 1 creature
<P></P>
Saving Throw: Neg.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Beastmask</I> may affect any single person or animal, or characters may cast it on
themselves. It allows the subject to take on the illusory form of a single animal
species--but only that species of animal can perceive the illusion. The subject may
not assume an animal form more than twice or less than one-quarter the
character's size.
<P></P>
The almost perfect illusion the spell creates deceives the animal's sight,
hearing, smell, and touch. For instance, once a character casts a &quot;bear&quot; illusion
on a subject, bears believe that subject to be a bear, while to humans, other
races, and other creatures, the subject remains the same.
<P></P>
Characters normally use <I>beastmask</I> to travel among or hunt a particular species. This spell lets a druid assume
the guise of a caribou to move among a herd without causing them to panic. A
character also could avoid being attacked by a pack of dire wolves by wearing a
wolf's &quot;mask.&quot;
<P></P>
<I>Beastmask</I> does not allow communication with the animal species, though it can be used
with animal communication spells.
<P></P>
The material component is a miniature wooden mask carved to look like the
animal.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Puffball </B>(Alteration)
<P></P>
<P></P>
Sphere: Plant
<P></P>
Range: Touch
<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>
Duration: 2 rounds/level of caster
<P></P>
Casting Time: 4
<P></P>
Area of Effect: 1 mushroom, etc.
<P></P>
Saving Throw: Special
<P></P>
<P></P>
A character who casts <I>puffball</I> on a normal mushroom, truffle, or toadstool (up to 6 inches in diameter)
transforms the fungus into a magical puffball, which the character may drop or
throw. The DM should decide what type of roll, if any, is required to hit the
target (Strength, Dexterity, etc.) See the <I>DMG</I>, pgs. 62-63, for rules on grenadelike missiles.
<P></P>
The puffball bursts upon landing, releasing a cloud of spores 10 feet in
diameter. Those caught in the spore cloud must save vs. poison or suffer an attack
of coughing and choking. Victims can make no attacks and lose all Dexterity
bonuses to Armor Class and saving throws. The cloud dissipates in 1d3+1 rounds;
residual effects still afflict characters one round after they escape the cloud
or it fades.
<P></P>
The spell's effects do not affect undead or similar nonbreathing creatures. If
no one throws (or drops) the missile by the time its duration expires, the
enchantment is lost.
<P></P>
The caster sprinkles the material component--a pinch of ground puffball--over
the fungus to be enchanted.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Whisperward</B> (Alteration)
<P></P>
<P></P>
Sphere: Guardian, Weather
<P></P>
Range: Touch
<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>
Duration: Permanent until triggered
<P></P>
Casting Time: 4
<P></P>
Area of Effect: 1 item
<P></P>
Saving Throw: None
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Whisperward</I> can be cast on any single item, portal, or closure (such as a book, door, or
lid). It may ward up to a 30-foot radius.
<P></P>
The character keys the ward to become activated (like a <I>magic mouth</I> spell) under specific conditions--such as when a certain individual enters
the area or opens the warded closure. When the ward is triggered, a soft
whispering breeze blows across the caster's face. The caster must stay within 1 mile
per experience level of the ward to receive the warning.
<P></P>
The material component is the priest's holy symbol.
