Again, there is a fairly strong central organization and authority. The guild
is a unified body and its rules are readily accepted by all. However, there is
room for some &quot;local latitude.&quot; This may take the form of senior thieves below
the guildmaster being able to make a few important decisions about affairs on
their own patch (own quarter of the city, etc.), or the central rulership
deliberately restricting the use of its authority in some cases, and so on.
