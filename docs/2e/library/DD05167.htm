The above advice is for players who don't yet have a firm handle on
role-playing different personalities from their own. And the personalities presented here
aren't firm, formal rules which any character has to follow; they're
guidelines with no real restrictions placed upon them.
<P></P>
Naturally, then, it's very appropriate for you to write up more Personality
Types appropriate to your campaign . . . if, indeed, you need to formalize them
to that extent.
<P></P>
It's also very appropriate for a character to change his Personality Type in
the course of a campaign. Here are some ways it can happen:
<P></P>
The <B>Brash Youth</B> wises up and loses his naivete and inexperience. This has to happen
eventually (unless he gets killed before he ever gets wise). His experiences in the
campaign so far will probably have a strong influence on the next type of
personality he chooses. Here's a note for the other personalities: Nothing short of
amnesia ever changes a character <I>to</I> the Brash Youth personality.
<P></P>
The <B>Crude Crusher</B> isn't likely to change, but a couple of things could bring about such a
change. He could fall in love with a more refined partner, and, feeling gross and
coarse in comparison, train himself to become more sophisticated. (The Merry
Showoff and Fated Philosopher become good options at this point.) He could have
heavy responsibility laid upon him (such as a military officer's commission) and
be changed by it (at which point the Natural Leader is a good choice).
<P></P>
The<B> Dangerous Antagonist</B> is only likely to change when whatever made him a Dangerous Antagonist
originally is resolved. For instance, if he ever avenges himself on whomever hurt him
in the first place, he could change to a Fated Philosopher or Natural Leader.
<P></P>
The<B> Doomed Champion</B> isn't likely ever to change. He's doomed, after all. But if, in the course of
the campaign, the DM allows him to un-doom or un-curse himself, he could
suffer a change of personality. He could become a Fated Philosopher or Natural
Leader. He might enjoy life so much that he becomes a Merry Showoff or Sneaky
Thinker. He's not likely to become a Dangerous Antagonist unless the events which
freed him from his curse were so nasty that they still scarred his personality
forever.
<P></P>
The <B>Fated Philosopher</B> isn't likely to change. This personality type comes at the <I>end</I> of a process of personality development, not in the middle.
<P></P>
The <B>Merry Showoff</B> could sober up under the weight of responsibility, like the Crude Crusher,
and become a Natural Leader. Or he could naturally evolve into a Sneaky Thinker
when it became less and less fulfilling merely to entertain people and more fun
to manipulate them.
<P></P>
The <B>Natural Leader</B> could easily change if dramatic events made him sick and disgusted with
always being so responsible and dependable. At that point, any personality except
Doomed Champion is appropriate. However, unless he's become totally amoral, even
in his new personality he'll probably still have leadership impulses and do a
lot of tactical thinking.
<P></P>
The <B>Sneaky Thinker</B> isn't ever likely to change: His way of life is too much fun to him. If he
were to change, to become a little less secretive, he'd probably become a Merry
Showoff.
<P></P>
For any character, some horrible event (such as the brutal murder of a loved
one) could change the character, at least temporarily, to a Dangerous Antagonist
or Crude Crusher.
