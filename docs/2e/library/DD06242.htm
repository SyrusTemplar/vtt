The DM makes the decision regarding precise verbal and somatic components for
any spell, although suggestions from players should be considered; specific
verbal and somantic components are not required, but they add color to the game by
giving players a clearer idea of exactly what procedures must occur in order
for their PC wizards to cast spells. Requiring specific components can also make
for some challenging game situations. For example, if a wizard is gagged, he
may be prevented from casting spells with spoken verbal components. Similarly, a
wizard with his hands bound behind him may have problems casting a spell whose
somatic component requires specific hand gestures. (See <A HREF="DD06202.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD06202.htm">Chapter 6</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> for more information about impaired casters and spell components.) Verbal
components can be single words, brief phrases, snatches of poetry, chants, or
nonsense syllables. They can be spoken, whispered, shouted, or sung. Verbal
components can also be groans, grunts, coughs, whistles, or any other vocally-produced
sound.

Often, the verbal component will relate to the effect of the spell. For
instance, the verbal component for<I> feather fall</I> might be the whispered word &quot;float,&quot; while a low, eerie moan might work for <I>detect undead</I>. <I>Dimension door</I> might be the spoken word &quot;open,&quot; while the verbal component for <I>gust of wind</I> might be a slow exhalation of air. Somatic components can be any type of
physical gesture. For some spells, merely touching or pointing at the target or
subject is sufficient. More elaborate gestures are suitable for higher-level
spells. In many cases, the somatic component will relate to the spell's effect. For
instance, the somatic component for <I>audible glamer</I> might require the caster to put his hand to his ear as if he were listening.
Rapidly rubbing the hands together might suffice for <I>chill touch</I>, while wiggling the fingers like a spider might serve as the somatic
component for <I>web</I>.
