Encounter tables are created before play begins. During a game session, the DM
has to take the information he has put into the encounter tables and bring it
to life.
<P></P>
To use an encounter table and run an encounter, the DM needs to know several
things: How often should he check for encounters? What is encountered? How many
creatures are there? How far away are they? Did they surprise, or were they
surprised by, the characters? What will the encountered group do? The rules below
tell you how to answer these questions.
