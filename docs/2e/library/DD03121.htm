<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Compulsive Honesty:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The character with this disadvantage cannot tell a lie and cannot behave in a
deceitful fashion. He tends to be blunt rather than tactful, even if this
means insulting someone who he and his companions are trying to impress.
<P></P>
The character could participate in a deception-but only if it is a matter of
life and death. Even then, the character must make a Wisdom/Willpower check
every time he is called upon to speak a falsehood or to act out a role in front of
witnesses. Failure of the role means that the character shrugs and comes clean?<I>-You-re right, my lord. I-m not here in the marketplace to shop for rugs, but
to steal the plans for the castle-s defenses.?
