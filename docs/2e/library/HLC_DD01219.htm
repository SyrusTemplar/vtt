characters have resolved the original conflict. Two or three adventures from
the previous examples might offer sites that can be used over and over again.
The city where the wizard lives and its criminal underworld?with its den of
dopplegangers?could generate many other adventures, especially if a player character
rogue decides to operate the local thieves? guild. Likewise, the valley?with
its simmering feud?could spawn additional adventures as the feud flares up from
time to time. Perhaps the defeated family?s vampire leader has hidden a few
servitor vampires in the opposing family.
