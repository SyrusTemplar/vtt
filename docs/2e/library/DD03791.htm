</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This hardcover <I>Monstrous Manual</I> was created in response to the many requests to gather monsters into a
single, durable volume which would be convenient to carry. With the <I>DUNGEON MASTER? Guide</I> <I>(DMG)</I> and the <I>Player's Handbook (PHB)</I>, the<I> Monstrous Manual</I> forms the core of the AD&amp;D? 2nd Edition game.
<P></P>
Every monster from the MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM? Volumes One and Two are contained
within, as well as a few creatures from later volumes. The monsters in the <I>Monstrous Manual</I> have been revised, edited, and updated. Statistics for many of the creatures
have been corrected, new information has been added to many of the entries, and
many monsters have been reclassified. There are some new beasts, as well. In
cases of conflicting information, the <I>Monstrous Manual</I> supersedes all previously published data.
<P></P>
Certain entries have been greatly condensed from MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM entries,
to make this book as complete as possible without increasing its size or
price. For instance, there is a full-page description of ravens in the MONSTROUS
COMPENDIUM appendix for the GREYHAWK? campaign setting; in this book, ravens are
given only a few lines in the &quot;Bird&quot; entry. This provides enough information to
use the creatures for a short encounter, and it allows a page to be devoted to
another adversary.
<P></P>
To find a monster in this book, flip through the pages or look in the index,
which contains listings for the common name(s) of every monster in the book,
referenced to the correct page.
<P></P>
All of the monsters described here are typical for their type. DMs should note
that unusual variations are encouraged, but they are most effective when they
depart from the expected. Likewise, entries describe typical lairs for
creatures, from the dungeon complexes they inhabit to the tree houses they build;
changing the look of these can make a monster encounter unique.
