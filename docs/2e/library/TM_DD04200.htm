This spell is similar to the 7th-level <I>spell turning</I>, which causes spells cast against the wizard to rebound on the original
caster. This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but
excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the
protected wizard, spell effects delivered by touch, and spell effects from
devices such as wands, staves, and so forth. Thus, a <I>light</I> spell cast to blind the protected wizard could be turned back upon and
possibly blind the caster, while the same spell would be unaffected if cast to light
an area in which the protected wizard were standing.
<P></P>
One to four (1d4) spell levels may be turned. The exact number is secretly
rolled by the DM; the player never knows how effective the spell is.
<P></P>
Unlike the 7th level version of this spell, <I>minor spell turning</I> is not capable of partially turning a spell. For example, if a wizard has
three levels of spell turning, he can turn three 1st-level spells, one 1st and one
2nd, or one 3rd-level spell. He can in no way turn spells of 4th level or
above. If the caster is the target of a spell of a higher level than he is capable
of turning, the caster receives the full brunt of the spell.
<P></P>
If the protected wizard and a spellcasting attacker both have spell turning
effects operating, a resonating field is created that has the following effects:
