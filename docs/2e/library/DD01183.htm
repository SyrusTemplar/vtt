Have each player put together a personality profile for all of their
characters. This goes beyond ability scores, equipment, and statistics listed on the
character record sheet.
<P></P>
Get as much detailed information about the hero as possible. The process helps
the player concentrate on aspects of the character that might otherwise be
overlooked, and the player can probably role-play the champion more convincingly
and consistently afterward. Your increased knowledge of the character allows you
not only to tailor adventures for the hero but it gives you a clearer picture
of how an NPC might perceive that champion, which improves your role-playing as
well. A good profile should contain the information described below. You can
make up a form for your players to fill out, or you can ask the player a series
of questions and record the answers yourself. It doesn-t matter how you collect
the information, as long as you get it in a form you can use.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Occupation:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>Most people define themselves by what they do. A player who lists a
character-s occupation as semi-retired adventurer has a mental image different from a
player who sees the same character as a country squire. Occupation also helps
determine what the character does when not adventuring. A semi-retired adventurer
probably spends a lot of time swapping tales about old adventures and listening
for rumors. A country squire probably spends a reasonable amount of time
managing property and pursuing outdoor activities, such as riding or hunting.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Personality: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This refers to the character-s general behavior, temperament, wit, sense of
humor, and other non-physical traits. Ask the player to sum up the character in a
few paragraphs. This information should give you a clearer picture of what the
player is trying to do with the character.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>General Appearance: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This is what the character looks like. The player should note the character-s
hair, eye, and skin color, favorite clothing, height, weight, favorite
equipment, and so on. The list should start with what a person might see when glancing
at the character and finish with what might be seen if a person studies the
character for awhile.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Distinguishing Features or Habits: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">These are personal oddities and quirks that might not be immediately visible.
A fighter-s buck teeth or funny cowlick won-t be noticed while the warrior is
wearing a helmet. This category includes things such as birthmarks, scars,
tattoos, and the like. It also includes favorite expressions, nervous habits, speech
patterns, and anything else that make the character unique.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Tastes and Preferences: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Note the character-s hobbies and other leisure pursuits, favorite foods,
favorite color, collections, pets, and the like. Also note things the character
doesn-t like; activities the character finds particularly distasteful or boring,
foods the character refuses to eat, least favorite animals, etc.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Residence: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This is where the character lives. At the minimum, note the place-s location,
size, and state of repair. It is best, however, to have the player make up a
detailed floor plan and description of the character-s home. Also make a few
notes about the surrounding area-s geography and politics.
<P></P>
Ideally, this should be a miniature dungeon complete with room by room
descriptions, specific spell effects, guard strengths, wards in place, etc. As DM,
you-ll need to look this over very carefully. Not only do 0-level servants
probably work here, but it has to be a livable space as well. If the villain comes to
visit, the PC might be thankful for the emergency exit installed during the
construction.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>History: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This includes the character-s race, when and where the character was born, and
where the character was raised and educated. Note the role that parents or
other relatives played in the character-s early life. If the character is an
orphan, find out who filled the parental role. Make a list of the hero-s living
relations, children, and spouse (if any).
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Friends and Allies: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Note an influential acquaintance the character might have. List the PC-s close
friends and long-time associates. Include all of the hero-s important
employees and henchmen (unless they belong on the enemies list). Make special note of
anybody the character meets or interacts with on a regular basis.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Enemies: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">List the character-s enemies. Start with personal enemies of the character.
Note the reasons for the animosity. List anyone with interests or desires that
are contrary to those of the character, and note the source of the contention.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Short-Term Goals: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Consider what the character hopes to accomplish in the near future. Find out
what problems or opportunities currently loom the largest in the character-s
mind (this requires frequent updating).
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Long-Term Goals: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Consider the character-s plans and ambitions for the distant future. Find out
what the character does if his goals are achieved. Find out what the character
does if the goals cannot be achieved.
