Alienists or Summoners
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Alienists deal with powers and entities from terrifyingly remote reaches of
space and time; for them, magical power is nothing more than the triumph of the
mind over the rude boundaries of dimension and distance. With knowledge and
strength of will, the eons that lie between the stars themselves can be conquered,
and unspeakable things from the endless black gulfs of space whisper terrifying
secrets to the wizard who dares communicate with them. Each spell, formula, or
enchantment represents a hidden truth in the structure of universe, a secret
man was not meant to know, and the alienist plunges without fear into abysses of
chaos and entropy that would blast a weaker man.
<P></P>
While the warlock deals with supernatural powers, his patrons are creatures
with near-human intelligence and motivations. They may embody vice, malice, or
corruption of the worst sort, but these are human faults. On the other hand, the
alienist’s allies are entities of cosmic evil older than time itself and
thankfully ignorant (or uncaring) of the very existence of mankind.
<P></P>
A campaign that features this philosophy of magic is a dark and dangerous one
indeed. The cosmology of an alienist campaign necessarily reduces human deities
and powers to mere phantasms or petty children, who are themselves blissfully
ignorant of the outer gulfs that surround humanity. If the DM decides that
contact with alien powers is the source of magical ability in his campaign, player
character wizards should be extremely scarce.
<P></P>
Alienists fall into three general categories: priests, intellectuals, and
scholars. Since the alienist’s patrons are powers in their own right, many cults or
forgotten religions venerate these entities, and some alienists are priests or
students of these vile societies. Intellectuals are characters who simply
desire more and more knowledge, the chance to plumb the reaches of space and time
with the power of their minds; all too often, these alienists blunder into a
dimension or a being that is so inimical to human thought or perception that they
return as raving lunatics. The last type of alienist, the scholar, is a
character who approaches his work with the greatest caution. Often, the scholar’s goal
is to learn just enough to interfere with another alienist, and nothing more;
he understands that there are things human eyes should never see, and carefully
avoids them.
<P></P>
The alienist progresses as noted under the spell point system, with the
following options in use:
<P></P>
<P></P>
The wizard may only choose fixed magicks.
<P></P>
The alienist may exceed his normal <A HREF="DD03512.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03512.htm">spell level limit</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> , with the penalties
<P></P>
described in the beginning of this chapter applied.
<P></P>
The alienist can choose to reduce the spell point cost of a spell by making
use of
<P></P>
a prolonged casting time or selecting a special casting condition.
<P></P>
The character gains <A HREF="DD03515.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03515.htm">bonus spell</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> points for his Intelligence score, as described
<P></P>
earlier in this chapter.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Alienists memorize spells normally by using their spell point allocation to
choose how many spells of which level will be available. When selecting spells,
an alienist can reduce the spell’s cost by choosing a longer casting time or
special casting condition. The alienist’s spells are cast normally and vanish from
memory after use, and he recovers spell points normally, so on the surface the
alienist seems to be fairly close to a standard wizard—the flexibility of the
spell point rules simply allows him to customize his arsenal of spells.
<P></P>
Unfortunately for the alienist, <I>learning </I>a spell in the first place is the problem. At 1st level, the alienist begins
with 1d4+1 1st-level spells. Each spell he attempts to learn after this initial
selection places his sanity at risk. (The chance of insanity varies with spell
level; see <A HREF="DD03527.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03527.htm">Table 24</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Risk of Insanity by Spell Level.) Although the secrets unveiled by the
spell may drive the wizard mad, going insane doesn’t prevent the wizard from
learning the spell. In fact, the comprehension of a particular spell is far more
unbalancing than attempting to learn a spell and failing, as reflected by the
increased chance for insanity when a character <I>succeeds</I> in his roll.
<P></P>
Conducting spell research, investigating the formulae for potions or scrolls,
or researching the ingredients or process for creating a magical item all
create a chance for insanity. The level of the spell in question (or the nearest
equivalent spell in the case of a potion, scroll, or magical item) is used for the
insanity check.
<P></P>
If the wizard fails his insanity check, he must attempt a saving throw vs.
death magic with a penalty of –2. If successful, the wizard is merely delirious or
incoherent for 1d3 days as he tries to reconcile his notion of the cosmos with
the awful truth revealed to him. During this time, the character cannot cast
spells, and fights with a penalty of –1 to his attack rolls. If the wizard fails
both the insanity check and the following saving throw, he must roll on <A HREF="DD03526.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03526.htm">Table 24</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Random Insanity Chart.
<P></P>
Many of these conditions are not true forms of madness, but instead represent
plagues, curses, or afflictions that may trouble the character. High-level
spells are much more dangerous than low-level spells for this purpose, since the
most powerful spells grant the wizard insights into the blackest gulfs of cosmic
horror. The following list detail effects of the various conditions:
<P></P>
<A NAME="a4132f81"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3"><B>Delirium: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The character lapses into a state of delirium lasting for 3d4 days during
which he wanders aimlessly and mumbles to himself or rants and raves. He does not
recognize friends and is incapable of any rational action; he is easily
frightened and flees most encounters. The character cannot cast spells, and if he is
restrained or threatened by combat, he becomes catatonic for 1 to 6 hours. After
the delirium passes, the character returns to normal.
<P></P>
<A NAME="ef27067e"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3"><B>Disorientation: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The wizard’s surroundings make no sense to him, and he is temporarily unable
to recognize places, people, or even his own possessions. Unlike amnesia, the
character retains command of his normal skills and abilities, although he fights
with a –2 penalty to his attack rolls and has a 20% chance of miscasting
spells. However, he has a difficult time initiating or following through on actions;
if told to stay put, he may wander off, or if his comrades flee from a monster,
he might remain behind, unaware of his danger. The character has a 5% chance
per day, cumulative, of recovering from his state.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3"><B>Attraction: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The character develops an unhealthy obsession with a particular place, thing,
or type of item. This manifests as an uncontrollable desire to be close to the
subject of the attraction. Good examples might be a particular star in the sky,
a mountain, a special site, the sea, an artifact or item, and so on. This
desire drives the character to drop everything he’s doing and travel to the site
(or in its direction, in the case of a celestial object). If the wizard’s friends
stop him, he’ll become disoriented for 1d6 hours, and then bend all his
efforts towards resuming his trek by whatever means are necessary. There is a
cumulative 5% chance of recovery per day.
<P></P>
<A NAME="1d6f9a0b"></A><A NAME="1d6f9a0b"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Phobia: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Exposure to some terrifying stimulus leaves a lasting mark in the character’s
psyche and makes him mortally afraid of some condition or creature. A character
confronted with the subject of his phobia automatically flees the scene with
all possible speed for at least 1d3 full turns. If the character cannot escape
the condition, he lapses into a catatonic state that lasts for 1d6 days. The DM
can assign an appropriate phobia, or roll on <A HREF="DD03528.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03528.htm">Table 25</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Phobias.
<P></P>
A character does not normally recover from a phobia, but certain spells or
psionic effects may desensitize him to his fear or repair his mind.
<P></P>
<A NAME="67b10155"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3"><B>Paranoia: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A wizard afflicted with this form of insanity becomes convinced that the
agents of the Outer Powers are abroad in his world, his homeland, and even in his
home town. They could be anywhere. At first, he is merely suspicious of
strangers, but as the condition progresses, his suspicion spreads to those nearest
him—his friends and family—and grows in strength, so that he begins taking
precautions to guarantee his own safety. These precautions eventually include lethal
attacks and plots against his former allies and friends.
<P></P>
The paranoid’s condition only grows worse as time passes; without magical
healing or psychic surgery, he will not recover. Generally, a paranoid PC becomes a
NPC under the DM’s control after 1d6 months have passed, or whenever the DM
feels that the player isn’t role-playing his character effectively anymore.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3"><B>Alienation: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The character experiences an acute sense of dislocation or <I>wrongness </I>in his surroundings. He is certain that he belongs somewhere else, although he
cannot say where that might be. While the paranoid experiences alienation
towards people, an alienated character regards everything in his
surroundings—people, places, and things— as unnatural and threatening. As the condition
progresses, the character loses his ability to function in society and gradually sinks
into dementia praecox or catatonia over the course of 1d6 months.
<P></P>
<A NAME="09a14f04"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3"><B>Amnesia: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Unable to absorb the secrets revealed to him, the wizard instead purges his
mind of anything that reminds him of the horrors he has explored. Only his
language skills remain; everything else—his class skills, his proficiencies,
knowledge of people and places—vanishes. He retains his hit point total and original
saving throw values, but for all other purposes he is now a 1st-level character
with no proficiencies. The amnesiac has a noncumulative 10% chance of recovery
each month. During his amnesia, the character may actually begin his adventuring
career all over again, possibly even changing class and alignment.
<P></P>
<A NAME="bfd60025"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3"><B>Hallucinatory insanity: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The character’s insights into the true nature of things leave him with the
ability to perceive sights, sounds, or sensations from the awful, alien dimensions
that parallel our own. To other characters, the wizard appears to be hearing
things, seeing things, or experiencing things that don’t exist. Unfortunately,
these hallucinations have a very tangible reality for the character himself, and
for any given action he undertakes—casting a spell, making an attack, even
trying to walk across a room or study his spells—there is a 33% chance (2 in 6)
that one of his hallucinations distracts him, preventing him from completing the
action. Each month, there is a 10% chance that the character learns how to
ignore these frightful apparitions and regains control of his perceptions.
<P></P>
<A NAME="142987ff"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3"><B>Melancholia: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The insignificance of humanity in the face of the Outer Powers is a terrifying
concept, and a wizard afflicted with melancholia suffers endless fits of
brooding and depression as this knowledge sinks into his mind. Each day, there is a
5% cumulative chance that the character experiences an acute episode that
completely disables him for 1d3 days. The melancholic will have no volition to
travel, fight, cast spells, or even look after his own survival, although his
friends may be able to lead him along on a journey or keep him out of the way on an
adventure. Melancholia persists until magically or psionically treated.
<P></P>
<A NAME="b88292d4"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3"><B>Dementia praecox: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This condition is similar to melancholia, but consists of a hopelessness or
loss of volition. The character just can’t bring himself to care about what is
going on around him, even ignoring direct attacks or immediate threats to his
life. Each time the character attempts an action, such as undertaking a journey,
participating in a fight, or casting a spell, there is a 50% chance (3 in 6)
that his dementia overwhelms him and he instead does nothing. If the character
loses his will to fight, he will not even defend himself, losing any Dexterity
adjustments to AC and suffering other penalties as the DM deems appropriate.
Dementia praecox persists until magically or psionically treated.
<P></P>
<A NAME="ec0d766f"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3"><B>Monomania: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The wizard becomes obsessed with a single goal and works ceaselessly until his
goal is achieved. Depending on the alienist’s origin, it might be the
summoning of one of the Outer Powers, the secret of the next spell level, or the
destruction of a particular cult or occult tome. As long as the wizard can pursue his
goal, he can undertake any actions that further his purpose, but if he is
somehow blocked or prevented from acting, he is likely to lapse into catatonia or
become manic. Note that the wizard’s single-minded devotion to his cause is not
healthy; he ignores sleep, goes without food, and otherwise neglects both
himself and others. Monomania persists through 1d4 linked, long-term goals; when the
wizard accomplishes them, he more or less returns to normal.
<P></P>
<A NAME="05fe52c2"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3"><B>Mania: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Terror of unimaginable depth turns the alienist into a stark, raving madman.
Every day, there is a 25% cumulative chance that he will suffer a manic episode
lasting 1d6 hours, during which he attempts to attack or destroy anything
around him. The maniac’s Strength is incredible; a character’s Strength increases by
6 points (count each percentile category of 18 as one point), to a maximum of
19. While the maniac is raging, he can easily turn on and kill people close to
him, but he’s just as likely to run off or try to gnaw the bark off a tree.
Even if the wizard is temporarily in control of his senses, he cannot cast spells
or embark on long or complicated tasks; the struggle to retain control consumes
too much of his attention. The alienist has a 5% chance per month of
recovering his stability.
<P></P>
<A NAME="8bfd209f"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3"><B>Manic-depressive: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This condition combines the worst features of mania and melancholia. Every 1d4
days, the character’s mood swings from the one condition to the other. A
manic-depressive’s condition lasts until magically or psionically treated.
<P></P>
<A NAME="f41dbcdb"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3"><B>Hebephrenia: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Some horrors can forever destroy the mind unfortunate enough to perceive them;
a character suffering from hebephrenia withdraws from reality into a childlike
state, wandering aimlessly, ignoring most external stimuli and babbling or
mumbling to himself constantly. This condition is completely debilitating. The
character is effectively <I>feebleminded</I>, unable to participate in normal society or survive without constant care.
The alienist may never recover from such a profound shock and has only a 5%
chance (noncumulative!) per month to regain his sanity.
<P></P>
<A NAME="8a2fd4d8"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3"><B>Catatonia: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The catatonic completely withdraws from reality, ignoring all forms of
external stimulus. He cannot move, speak, or act in any way, and may even ignore food
placed in his mouth or painful injuries. There is only a 5% chance per month
(noncumulative) that the catatonic will recover from his state, although it is
possible to provoke a catatonic into a temporary rage lasting 1d6 rounds by
continuously annoying or pestering the poor fellow.
<P></P>
<A NAME="09aeb742"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3"><B>Delusional insanity: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The alienist believes that he is something other than himself. In many cases,
he believes that his mind or persona has been placed into the wrong body,
believing that he is actually a creature or entity of some distant dimension trapped
in human form. The steps he takes to rectify this could range from attempts at
suicide to complex summonings designed to open the “right” dimension to him.
The character may refuse to recognize his former friends and companions, or seek
new allies more appropriate to his “true” self, but he generally retains all
his skills and abilities. There is a 5% chance per month that the delusion may
end of its own accord; otherwise, only magical or psionic treatment can help the
character.
<P></P>
<A NAME="96d6d519"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3"><B>Schizophrenia: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">An alienist’s encounter with schizophrenia is an extraordinarily dangerous
event. An entity or power from the outer reaches of the cosmos invades the
alienist’s body, forming a second personality that has its own goals and skills
distinct from the wizard’s normal personality. This second persona may wish to do
nothing more than observe the host’s world, or it may plot to open a dimensional
gateway to the plane of its origin and bring others like itself to the mundane
world.
<P></P>
Each day, there is a 25% chance that the second personality takes over,
retaining control for 1d4 days while it pursues its own purposes, whatever they may
be. During this time, the wizard is an NPC under the DM’s control. This
condition occasionally corrects itself after a time (if the invasive personality
finishes whatever it was doing and leaves voluntarily), but most of the time the
wizard will need magical or psionic help in order to exorcise the spirit.
<P></P>
<A NAME="958e2097"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3"><B>Homicidal mania: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This resembles <A HREF="DD03525.htm#96d6d519"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03525.htm#96d6d519">schizophrenia</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> , as described above, but it’s much worse. The invasive persona is a creature
that delights in mayhem and murder, and wants nothing more than to kill until
it is sated. When the wizard loses control of his mind, the entity begins
stalking and killing its chosen victims (often those closest to the host), often
employing bizarre or disgusting methods to further its enjoyment. As described
above, there is a slight chance (5% per month) that the entity leaves voluntarily.
<P></P>
<A NAME="35c4f715"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3"><B>Psychic translocation: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Perhaps the most jarring event that could occur to an alienist, psychic
translocation exchanges the wizard’s mind and persona with that of some inhuman
entity from beyond the stars. The effects are somewhat similar to that of a magic
jar spell in that the wizard finds himself trapped in another’s body while some
alien intelligence animates his own form. The invasive intelligence may simply
be curious about the wizard’s home, it might have forced the switch in order to
escape from a precarious predicament in its own dimension, or it might have
waited for eons for a chance to project its mind to the alienist’s world, with
some dire purpose or summoning in mind. There is a chance that the intelligence
will leave of its own accord, or that the wizard may find a means to reverse the
situation and reclaim his own body. The DM is encouraged to be creative and
malevolent.
<P></P>
<A NAME="64599056"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3"><B>Pursuit: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">There are entities in the dimensions beyond our own that are so inimical and
insatiable that even speaking their names or catching a glimpse of their
existence courts disaster of the worst kind. An alienist who blunders across something
of this nature accidentally attracts the notice of a monstrous alien
intelligence, which then follows the wizard back to his home. The pursuing entity may be
a powerful monster that desires to devour or possess the mortal that roused
it, or it could be a forgotten abomination of formless intelligence that desires
to devour or possess the alienist’s entire world. Again, the DM is encouraged
to be creative and somewhat malevolent; mortals who tamper with powers of this
magnitude risk catastrophes of cosmic significance.
<P></P>

<P></P>
Recurring Episodes of Insanity
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> While a wizard may emerge from a mind-blasting experience with his senses
intact after a few weeks, he is never the same afterwards. Each time the wizard is
forced to roll on <A HREF="DD03527.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03527.htm">Table 24</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> , regardless of the actual result, his Wisdom score drops by 1d2 points
permanently. Wisdom represents stability, strength of will, and mental fortitude; it
is a good measure of how many shocks a single person can sustain in the course
of his lifetime. Should a wizard’s Wisdom score ever be reduced to less than
3, he becomes <I>permanently </I>insane, and he will never recover from whatever condition(s) he currently
suffers from.
<P></P>
However, there are ways to bolster a character’s strength of mind after he
suffers a Wisdom loss. A condition that is treated by means of a <I>restoration </I>or <I>wish </I>spell, successful psychic surgery, or an <I>elixir of health </I>does not cause a Wisdom loss, since the mind is restored to its original
state. Of course, when someone attempts to heal the condition by using a spell or
psychic surgery, there is a 1% chance that the healer will contract the
condition. As a result, it might be a little difficult finding someone willing to help
heal a character’s insanity.
