The Beast-Riders campaign is very similar to the Barbarians and Berserkers
campaign. But there are significant differences in the player-characters' goals
and motivations.
<P></P>
In the Beast-Riders campaign, it's the tribe's association with its totem
animal that provides much of the flavor of the campaign. The villains and threats
of the campaign don't just menace the humans; they also endanger the animals on
whom the tribe is so dependent.
<P></P>
For example, in such a campaign, an evil wizard deeper in the wilderness has
allied himself with an animal that is a natural (or unnatural) enemy of the
tribe's totem. Now, he's sending his own warriors after the tribe's animals, trying
to destroy them and conquer the tribe. If the player-character tribesmen ride
dire wolves, the sorcerer's minions, fewer in number than the tribesmen, will
be ogres riding smilodons (sabre-tooth tigers). If the PCs ride pegasi, the
more-numerous enemies might be goblins riding giant bats.
<P></P>
Perhaps this evil sorcerer wants the tribe's land; perhaps he wants the
tribe's princess; perhaps his god is an enemy of the god representing the tribe's
animal totem. Whatever the cause, he's evil and must be dealt with.
<P></P>
In the early stages of the campaign, the ordinarily-happy tribesmen suddenly
begin suffering attacks at the hands of these enemies. They must defend their
village from the first, murderous assault, then set up patrols and reconnaissance
missions to probe into enemy territory and find out what's going on.
Ultimately, they will have to assemble a crack team of tribesmen (the player-characters
and their immediate friends) to penetrate enemy territory, sneak into the
citadel of the enemy, and destroy him.
<P></P>
Additionally, all the campaign types appropriate for the Barbarians and
Berserkers campaign work just as well with the Beast-Riders campaign.
<P></P>
In this sort of campaign, since everyone has the same Warrior Kit and might
seem very similar, each warrior should choose a very different Personality in
order to distinguish himself from his fellows.
<P></P>
This campaign may have no interaction at all with the world's civilized
nations; or, the tribe's enemy might be a powerful lord from the civilized lands, and
the heroes' mission to destroy him will be doubly perilous because they don't
know what they'll be facing in those strange lands.
