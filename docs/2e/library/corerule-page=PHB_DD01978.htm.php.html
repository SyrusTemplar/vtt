By means of this spell, the caster sets up a natural repulsion between the
affected object and all other living things except himself. Thus, any living
creature attempting to touch the affected object is repulsed (unable to come closer
than 1 foot), or repulses the affected object, depending on the relative mass
of the two (a halfling attempting to touch an iron chest with an <I>avoidance</I> spell upon it will be thrown back, while the chest will skitter away from a
giant-sized creature as the creature approaches).
<P></P>
The material component for the spell is a magnetized needle. The spell cannot
be cast upon living things; any attempt to cast avoidance upon the apparel or
possessions of a living creature entitles the subject creature to a saving throw
vs. spell.
<P></P>
The reverse of this spell, <I>attraction,</I> uses the same material components and sets up a natural attraction between
the affected object and all living things. A creature is drawn to the object if
the creature is smaller, or the object slides toward the creature if the
creature is larger. It takes a successful bend bars/lift gates roll to remove the
enchanted object once it has adhered to an object or creature.
