<TITLE>Bowl of Watery Death-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Bowl of Watery Death:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This device looks exactly like a <I>bowl commanding water elementals,</I> right down to the color, design, magical radiation, etc. However, when it is
filled with water, the wizard must successfully save vs. spell or be shrunk to
the size of a small ant and plunged into the center of the bowl. If salt water
is poured into the bowl, the saving throw suffers a -2 penalty.
<P></P>
The victim will drown in 1d6 + 2 rounds, unless magic is used to save him, for
he cannot be physically removed from the <I>bowl of watery death</I> except by magical means: <I>animal growth, enlarge,</I> or <I>wish</I> are the only spells that will free the victim and restore normal size; a <I>potion of growth</I> poured into the water will have the same effect; a <I>sweet water</I> potion will grant the victim another saving throw (i.e., a chance that the
curse magic of the bowl works only briefly). If the victim drowns, death is
permanent, no resurrection is possible, and even a <I>wish</I> will not work.
