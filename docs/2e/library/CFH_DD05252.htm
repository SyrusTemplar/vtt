Review the Wrestling rules from the <I>Player’s Handbook</I>,<I> <A HREF="PHB_DD01704.htm"></A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="PHB_DD01704.htm">page 98</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">. Each successful wrestling move does 1 point of damage (plus Strength bonus,
if the attacker desires); a continued hold causes cumulatively 1 more point of
damage each round than the round before.
<P></P>
In Wrestling combat, when two characters are wrestling, each rolls to attack
rolls the other—using normal attack rolls against the opponent's AC, and
utilizing the &quot;<A HREF="PHB_DD01705.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01705.htm">Armor Modifiers For Wrestling</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot; table on page 97 of the <I>Player's Handbook</I> for modifiers to attack rolls.
<P></P>
In a single combat round, a character can perform Wrestling on the other
character, with the normal results from the Punching and Wrestling Results table
from that same page. On Wrestle results from that table which are marked with an
asterisk (*), the attacker, if successful, can maintain that hold until it's
broken; use the Strength-roll rules described above for the &quot;Grab&quot; maneuver to
determine when holds are broken.
<P></P>
A character can pull wrestling damage; he can do no damage, or the 1 point
associated with each successful maneuver, or the 1 point plus Strength bonus
allowed to him, whichever he chooses.
<P></P>
As with punching damage, wrestling damage is also temporary.
