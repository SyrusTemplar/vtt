This spell causes the wizard's shadow to elongate, stretching away from his
body at a rate of 15 yards per round. It can elongate a maximum distance of 10
yards per level of the caster.
<P></P>
The shadow moves as an ordinary shadow, along floors and up walls. The caster
may maneuver in any manner feasible to place the shadow where he desires. A
caster might position his shadow over a high window in a tower in order to spy on
the tower's occupants. The shadow makes no sound and is 90% undetectable in all
but the brightest surroundings.
<P></P>
While the spell lasts, the illusionist can see, hear, and speak through his
shadow. The shadow cannot physically touch, pick up, or attack creatures or
objects. It can be struck only by spells, magical weapons of +1 or better, or other
special attacks (such as a dragon's breath). The shadow has the same Armor
Class as the caster. Hit points lost by the shadow are suffered by the caster.
<P></P>
To cast the spell, a light source of at least the brightness of a candle must
be present.
<P></P>
The material component is a small statuette of the caster sculpted from a
piece of obsidian worth at least 1,000 gp.
