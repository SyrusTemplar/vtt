Specialist wizards? saving throw adjustments for spells within their schools
of specialization apply during duels unless the characters choose to forgo them.
Such adjustments require an extra turn of preparation when building the arena.
Specialists are free to use any available bonus spells during a duel.
<P></P>
Specialists also suffer from a disadvantage in duels; spells from their
opposition schools gain an extra power rank. For example, <I>dispel magic</I> spells have a rank of 13, not 12, when used against illusionists because
Abjuration is opposed to Illusion. The bonus represents the specialists? lack of
experience when dealing with magic from their opposition schools.
<P></P>
A dueling arena provides a stable magical environment, and wild surges and
level variations never occur within them. It is possible to construct an arena
that allows level variations, but both combatants must be wild mages and wild
surges still are impossible. In a duel, level variations raise or lower a spell?s
power rank.
<P></P>
For example, Johan the Rat casts an <I>unseen servant</I> spell, which normally has a power rank of 10. If Johan rolls a level
variation of ?5, that particular unseen servant spell has power rank of 5.
<P></P>
A spell?s other dueling characteristics and effects can also be altered by a
level variation. For example, if Johan were a 13th-level wild mage and cast a <I>fireball</I> spell with a level variation of ?5, the <I>fireball </I>spell?s power score would be reduced to 7 and the spell could inflict only 8d6
points of damage. The spell?s movement also would be reduced from 5 to 4.
<P></P>
Elementalists? saving throw adjustments apply during duels. The elementalist
ability to cast a spell at higher level than normal does not apply unless both
combatants are elementalists. If used, the casting level increase boosts the
spell?s power score and other characteristics in the same manner as described
above.
