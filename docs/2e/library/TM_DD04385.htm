This spell creates the illusion of as many as four siege engines. The casting
priest may choose from ballistae, siege towers, catapults, rams, or any
combination thereof. Like the creatures created by the spell <I>shadow monsters</I>, these illusory engines have at least a tenuous reality and can inflict
damage on enemies.
<P></P>
<I>Shadow engines</I> are accompanied by illusory crews of the appropriate number and race. The
engines can move at a rate of 20 yards per turn and are unaffected by terrain
considerations. (The caster can choose to slow them when passing through rough
terrain to aid the illusion of reality.)
<P></P>
<I>Shadow engines</I> cannot carry real troops. They can be fired at the same rate as real engines
of the appropriate type, but a hit causes only one-half the damage normal for
that type of engine (round fractions down).
<P></P>
A <I>shadow engine</I> remains in existence until the spell duration expires, until an enemy unit
approaches within 10 yards, or until it suffers damage from an enemy missile
attack. When any of these conditions occur, the engine vanishes. If a single spell
has created multiple engines, only the engine struck vanishes; the others
remain.
<P></P>
The crew associated with a <I>shadow engine</I> must remain with that engine; it cannot move more than 5 yards away from the
engine itself.
<P></P>
<I>Shadow engines</I> can move independently of other engines created by the spell as long as they
remain within the area of effect and remain within 240 yards of the caster. The
caster must maintain concentration to control the <I>shadow engines</I>. He cannot cast any other spells, and he is limited to a movement rate of 6.
If the caster is struck for damage, the <I>shadow engines</I> vanish.
<P></P>
The material component is a finely detailed miniature model of a siege engine
(of any type), which is consumed during the casting.
