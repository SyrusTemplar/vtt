With this spell, a wizard can graft any freshly harvested flesh to the body of
the recipient, either replacing a lost limb or serving as a disguise. The
duration is limited only by the compatibility of the grafted flesh to the host-s
own body. Flesh harvested from the recipient him- or herself (such as a severed
limb) can be permanently reattached with this spell. If the grafted limb were
taken from a fresh corpse, however, the maximum duration of the spell would be 1
day/level of the caster. Only musculo-skeletal tissues are affected by this
spell; it cannot be used to graft organs or attach additional appendages (such as
an extra arm) to the recipient.
<P></P>
<I>Graft flesh</I> can also disguise the subject (who may be the caster) with the flesh from a
cadaver. While the subject gains the facial and bodily appearance of the
deceased individual, the transformation is only -skin deep.- The recipient retains his
normal voice, knowledge, spells, and other abilities. Furthermore, the subject
does not gain any physical or sensory abilities associated with his new
appearance (the spell cannot, for instance, increase the host-s physical strength or
replace lost eyesight). This application lasts 1 day/level of the caster.
<P></P>
For the duration of the spell, grafted flesh literally becomes an extension of
the host-s own body (affected tissue radiates a faint aura of necromancy,
however). The recipient has complete control over the flesh as if it were his or
her own. At the conclusion of the spell, the grafted flesh slowly deadens and
ultimately drops away. A successful <I>dispel magic</I> ends the spell prematurely.
<P></P>
<I>Graft flesh</I> only functions on living human, demihuman, or humanoid subjects. The material
component is the host-s own severed limb or else a suitable replacement from a
fresh corpse (dead for no longer than 1 day per level of the caster). Grafted
tissue must be harvested from the same species as the host. <I>Graft flesh</I> cannot be combined with other enchantments (such as <I>embalm</I> or <I>spirit bind</I>) which are used to preserve a corpse. By the conclusion of the spell, all
grafted flesh has decayed past all utility and cannot be used in a subsequent
casting.
