Some societies exist where the alignment of the ruler(s) is sharply different
from the general social alignment. For example, a lawful evil dictator might
rule over a society mostly comprised of freedom-loving chaotics, enslaved by
military might. Here, while the agents of law enforcement would have a very
punitive attitude towards thieves, the common population might regard them as heroes,
possibly giving shelter to a thief on the run, or at the least not giving the
thief away.
