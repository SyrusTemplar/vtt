This powerful spell enables the caster to cure many persons (even an entire
community) who are afflicted with a nonmagical disease. The priest need not touch
or even see the diseased people for the spell to be effective, although
recipients must be within the area of effect.
<P></P>
This spell does not cure all diseases in the community at one time; the caster
must specifically state which disease is to be eliminated (black plague or
yellow fever, for example) with each casting of the spell.
<P></P>
When the spell is cast, the priest exhales a sweet-smelling breath. This forms
into a breeze that radiates outward, forming a circle that expands in a
50-yard radius per hour. During this time, the caster must remain at the center of
the area of effect. For example, after 12 hours, the <I>breath of life</I> would cover a circle 1200 yards in diameter (600-yard radius). The breath is
of a magical nature rather than a physical nature; therefore, it is unaffected
by prevailing winds.
<P></P>
The breeze blows through the community, instantly eliminating the specified
disease from all afflicted citizens. The <I>breath of life</I> spell does not destroy parasitic monsters (such as green slime, rot grubs,
and others), nor does it cure lycanthropy or other magical afflictions. The spell
does not prevent recurrence of a disease if the recipients are again exposed.
<P></P>
The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a cone of incense
that has been blessed by the highest priest of the character's religion.
<P></P>
The <I>breath of death</I>, which produces a foul-smelling wind, is the reverse of this spell. Victims
who fail a saving throw vs. death magic are afflicted with a nonmagical, fatal
disease. To determine the results of this spell, the DM should roll saving
throws for major NPCs in the area of effect. The effect on the rest of the community
can be calculated as a percentage, based on the saving throw.
<P></P>
Infected creatures do not heal hit points until the disease is cured. The
disease is fatal within 1d6 weeks (the duration varies from person to person).
<P></P>
The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of dust
taken from a mummy's corpse.
