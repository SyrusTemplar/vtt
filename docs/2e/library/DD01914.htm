When this spell is cast, the wizard creates an unmoving, opaque sphere of
force of any desired color around his person. Half of the sphere projects above the
ground, and the lower hemisphere passes through the ground. Up to seven other
man-sized creatures can fit into the field with its creator; they can freely
pass into and out of the hut without harming it. However, if the spellcaster
removes himself from the hut, the spell dissipates.
<P></P>
The temperature inside the hut is 70 F., if the exterior temperature is
between 0 and 100 F. An exterior temperature below 0 or above 100 lowers or
raises, respectively, the interior temperature on a 1 -for-1 basis. The tiny hut
also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, sandstorms,
and the like. The hut can withstand any wind of less than hurricane force
without being harmed, but wind force greater than that destroys it.
<P></P>
The interior of the hut is a hemisphere; the spellcaster can illuminate it
dimly upon command, or extinguish the light as desired. Note that although the
force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within. Missiles,
weapons, and most spell effects can pass through the hut without affecting it,
although the occupants cannot be seen from outside the hut. The hut can be
dispelled.
<P></P>
The material component for this spell is a small crystal bead that shatters
when the spell duration expires or the hut is dispelled.
