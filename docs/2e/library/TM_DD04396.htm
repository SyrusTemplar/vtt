This spell enables the caster to open a portal to one elemental plane of his
choice (as appropriate for his patron Power). He can then summon elementals from
that plane.
<P></P>
After the first turn of casting, 3d3 elementals of 12HD each appear; after the
second turn, 2d3 elementals of 16HD each appear; after the third turn, 1d3
elementals of 20HD each appear. Each elemental has at least 5 hit points per hit
die. The elementals remain for six turns from the time they first appear.
<P></P>
These elementals will obey the priest explicitly and cannot be turned against
the caster. The priest does not need to concentrate to maintain control over
the elementals. They cannot be dismissed with spells such as <I>dismissal</I>; the elementals remain for the duration of the spell.
