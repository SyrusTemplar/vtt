<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Horn of Fog:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This small, buglelike device allows its possessor to blow forth a thick cloud
of heavy fog equal to that of a <I>fog cloud</I> spell. Each round spent blowing it creates a 10-foot cube fog cloud. The
cloud lasts for 2d4 rounds after the last round of blowing the instrument. Note
that should it stop being sounded for a round, a new <I>fog cloud</I> will have begun, as the initial one has a life expectancy of but 2d4 more
minutes, and will have drifted away from the individual sounding it. The device
makes a deep, horn-like noise, the note dropping abruptly to a lower register at
the end.
