</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">If two characters have declared wrestling attacks against each other, they
automatically grasp each other. Skip the initial attack roll and make an opposed
roll on the fastest characterâ€™s action phase to see who has the advantage. The
winner establishes a hold, or a lock if his roll was good enough to score a
critical hit.
