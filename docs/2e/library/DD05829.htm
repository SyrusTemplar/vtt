Unique Thieves

Most thieves go through a period of training and apprenticeship, as do
legitimate tradesmen. They are taught by an established, experienced thief, who was
taught by a thief before him. This goes back untold generations, to the earliest
thieves who developed skills on their own and then shared them with partners
and apprentices. Over the years the skills and techniques have been formalized
and perfected, especially under the normalizing influence of the large and
powerful guilds that have arisen.
<P></P>
But not every thief is molded in this way. There are always others, known as
&quot;lone wolves,&quot; who developed outside the &quot;system&quot; of the established underworld.
They discovered and developed their larcenous abilities without the aid of a
mentor.
<P></P>
Many lone wolves resemble normal thieves so closely that they may be treated
as the very same thing, as far as class, abilities and restrictions go.
<P></P>
However, in some cases a lone wolf may turn out very different-perhaps
different enough to be considered a class unto himself. To design such a character,
you may use the optional rules, &quot;Creating a New Class,&quot; in Chapter Three of the<I> Dungeon Master's Guide</I>.
<P></P>
The emphasis of such a character should still be on thieve's skills, but it
may be that not all of the traditional skills are present. And the character may
have other unusual abilities as well, cultivated to assist in his roguish
endeavors.
<P></P>
Imagine, for instance, a self-taught pickpocket. He may have Pick Pockets,
Move Silently and Hide in Shadows, and perhaps Climb Walls (to help get himself
over fences or whatever when he is pursued by an observant and angry victim). But
he could have no other thief skills; for his thieving lifestyle there was no
need for them.
<P></P>
Note how this would be different from a traditional thief specialized in
pickpocketing (as in, for example, the cutpurse kit): Even though he specializes in
the course of his career, the cutpurse received a core training that included
all the thief traditional skills-a liberal arts education in larceny, if you
will.
<P></P>
Lone wolves often lead dangerous lives. They must be very self-reliant, and
they have to find their own contacts for scoping out jobs and fencing stolen
goods. As &quot;freelancers&quot; they run a constant and most serious risk of running afoul
of monopolistic thieves' guilds.
<P></P>
Guilds are often wary of lone wolves, who are more likely than &quot;established&quot;
thieves, with trusted contacts and reliable references, to be spies for
authorities or rival guilds. The lone wolf is also regarded by guildsmen with a mix of
curiosity and contempt-and sometimes even admiration, if his odd mix of
abilities proves particularly useful &quot;in the field.&quot;
<P></P>
A lone wolf, as we said, may be a character class unto himself. Most such
classes never have more than one member, and when he dies his unique combination of
skills is forgotten; the class ceases to be. On rare occasion a lone wolf may
take an apprentice or two, and the class may be perpetuated in this manner. (If
you are using the 1st edition AD&amp;D? game, you may suppose that the Assassin
class arose in this manner.)
<P></P>
Guilds who have accepted lone wolves into their ranks may ask the thief to
take on apprentices-but two things usually prevent this: One, conservative
guildmembers typically see the lone wolf's unorthodox methods as a threat (because
they are not understood), or as inferior to the traditional way of doing things;
and two, lone wolves, used to doing things by themselves, are reluctant to share
their secrets. An example follows:
