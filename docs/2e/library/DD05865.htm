This is perhaps the commonest state of affairs. The officers of the law do
their best to prosecute the law. However, a small number are corrupt, they don't
have enough manpower, they know their chances of recovering stolen property are
very low and this adversely affects morale and motivation, and so on. The
lawmen aren't uncaring, they're just somewhat disillusioned and their morale isn't
so good. They will perk up and make a determined effort to find out who has
pulled a big heist when one takes place, and if thieves resort to real violence
they will really come looking for them. Otherwise, they just go through the
motions. One or two bright and enthusiastic younger officers may resent the cynicism
and world-weariness of their elders, but not for long; they soon capitulate to
the prevailing attitudes.

Many thieves with experience in such places have a proverb which (there are
several versions) runs along the lines of, &quot;if you get round the corner you're a
free man&quot;?that is, get away from any watch officer in the street with your
pilfered gains and you won't exactly be chased with real determination.
