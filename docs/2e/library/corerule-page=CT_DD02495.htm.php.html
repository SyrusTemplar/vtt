character and monster has his or her favorite weapon and preferred means of

for a fight and execute his attacks during the battle.

proficiency slot. Warriors can actually specialize in fighting styles to gain
bonus attacks or defenses; this is covered in <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02645.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02645.htm.php.html">Chapter Four</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">.
