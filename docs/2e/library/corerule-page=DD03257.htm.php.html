This power allows the user to float by using telekinesis on himself. The user
can lift himself at the rate of 1 foot a second, or 60 feet a round. He can
descend as quickly as he wants by simply letting himself fall, then slowing down
as he nears the ground. The user can always levitate his own weight. Additional
weight, such as equipment or passengers, is a hindrance. Every 25 pounds of
added weight improves the power’s MAC by 1.

Levitation isn’t flying. The power provides no horizontal movement. The user
can hover motionlessly and drift with the wind, or he can push off a wall or
other fixed object and drift up to 60 feet a round in a straight line. He can’t
stop, however, until he meets another solid object, lowers himself to the ground,
or stops paying the PSP cost. Two powers—control wind and project force—can
help the levitating user propel himself forward and change direction. The use of
these additional powers requires the extra expenditure of PSPs and MTHAC0 rolls.
