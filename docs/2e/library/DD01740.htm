</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character or creature affected by paralysis becomes totally immobile for the
duration of the spell's effect. The victim can breathe, think, see, and hear,
but he is unable to speak or move in any manner. Coherent thought needed to
trigger magical items or innate powers is still possible.
<P></P>
Paralysis affects only the general motor functions of the body and is not the
ultimate destroyer of powerful creatures. It can be particularly potent on
flying creatures, however.

<I> The adventurers encounter a beholder, a fearsome creature with magical powers
that emanate from its many eyes.
<P></P>
After several rounds of combat, the party's priest casts a hold monster spell,
paralyzing the creature. The paralyzed beholder can still use the spell-like
powers of its eyes and can still move about (since it levitates at will). But,
on the other hand, it is not able to move its eyestalks to aim. Since all of its
eyes were most likely facing forward at the moment of paralysis, the
adventurers cleverly spread out in a ring around the creature. To attack one or two of
them with its powers, the beholder must turn its back on the rest.
