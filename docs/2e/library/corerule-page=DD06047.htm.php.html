This can be as simple as consistent observation of the prices and costs listed
in the Players Handbook, or as complicated and involved as a DM cares to make
it. Because so many thieves measure their accomplishments in financial terms,
however, some sort of consistent measure of worth is extremely important.
<P></P>
Another consideration within the economic system is the effect of theft on the
items being re-sold. Certainly a jeweled tiara can be appraised at 1,000 gp.
However, if word of its theft has traveled far and wide, PC thieves might have
difficulty getting someone to pay half the listed amount.

Other aspects of economics often overlooked in a campaign can be very relevant
for thieves. Bribes are often necessary in order to gain information or to
persuade a guard to look the other wayâ€”keep rigorous track of this cost of doing
business! Protection money might be offered by victims; conversely, if a
merchant is paying protection money to someone else (a thieves guild, for example),
those being paid will leave no stone unturned in seeking the one who has flaunted
their warnings.
<P></P>
All such extra costs and hidden consequences should be determined by the DM,
at least to the extent of their impact upon the campaign environment. It can be
left up to the PCs to discover for themselves how these little extras can
impact (perhaps even shorten!) their illicit careers.
