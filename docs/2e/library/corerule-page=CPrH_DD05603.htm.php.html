<P></P>
<B>Description:</B> This priest is devoted to the cause of peace. He is a champion of passive
resistance, of achieving one's ends without resorting to violence of any kind.
<P></P>
There are no special requirements to be a priest of this sort. Nor are there
special rules for abandonment of the kit, if the character eventually feels that
he needs to be wielding force to achieve his ends.
<P></P>
<B>Barred:</B> Priests of the following gods, forces and philosophies may not be Pacifist
Priests: Disease, Evil, Justice/Revenge, War.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> In a campaign, this priest can be a real aggravation to the more
combat-oriented player-characters. Therefore, the DM should allow this priest in only the
following situations:
<P></P>
(1) When he's an NPC, so that the DM doesn't have to work to contrive to keep
him with the party all the time (they'll have an easier time of abandoning him
if they wish);
<P></P>
(2) When he's part of a specific quest or mission (i.e., they must accompany
him and guard him throughout the quest or it will automatically fail); or
<P></P>
(3) When all the PCs are pacifists (this would be a very unusual campaign or
quest, indeed...).
<P></P>
Note, though, that just because the priest demands peacefulness of all around
him, his allies don't have to obey. However, it is inevitable that in combat
situations the player of the pacifist priest will feel left out (he can't fight);
additionally, he'll feel compelled by his philosophy to argue with the other
PCs, to chide them for their violence, which will get on their nerves.
Therefore, the DM should keep such quests short, so that the pacifist priest doesn't
drive the other characters to the point that they'll kill him.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> This priest may choose or random-roll his secondary skill. It may not be
Armorer, Hunter, or Trapper/Furrier (if he rolls one of these up randomly, he may
re-roll).
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> The Pacifist Priest may not know any Weapon Proficiency except bow and dart,
and may know them only if his true priest-class allows them. The priest may
only use these weapons in competition, as described below under &quot;Special
Hindrances.&quot; The priest still receives all his Weapon Proficiency slots, and if he ever
abandons this kit may &quot;spend&quot; them at a rate of two slots every experience
level.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Bonus Proficiency: Etiquette. Recommended: Languages (Modern), Languages
(Ancient), Ancient History, Singing, Musical Instrument, Reading/Writing.
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> This priest may not buy any armor, and may not buy any weapon except dagger
or knife (for eating only), and bow and dart (if he has proficiency with them).
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> This priest is a very compelling personality. He receives a +2 to his
Charisma score (his Charisma cannot exceed 18 from this bonus), and, in addition to
any reaction bonus that his heightened Charisma gives him, he receives a +2
reaction from anyone who is not utterly opposed to his philosophy. (Beings opposed
to his philosophy include priests and devoted adherents of the gods, forces and
philosophies mentioned above under &quot;Barred,&quot; and certain warlike nonhuman races
like orcs, ogres and trolls.)
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> This priest may never wear armor, and may never use weapons, spells or any
other tactics to harm a human, demihuman, nonhuman, or monster. If he ever
violates this decree, his <I>god</I> will not punish him (because the pacifist's oath is one he took for himself,
not for his god), but his own guilt will deprive him of all magic spells for
the span of one month. (If the DM wishes, if the priest is a follower of the god
of Peace, the god can instead punish him as a &quot;Betrayal of Goals&quot; from the <B>Role-Playing</B> chapter.) Naturally, if he later abandons the kit, he can resume the wearing
of armor and use of weapons according to his priest-class.
<P></P>
<B>Wealth Options:</B> This priest gets the usual 3d6x10 gp.
<P></P>
<B>Races: </B>No special limitations.
