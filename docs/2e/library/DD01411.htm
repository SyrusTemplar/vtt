to play the 2nd Edition. We advise you to read the entire <I>Player's Handbook,</I> but the biggest changes are in these chapters: <A HREF="DD01456.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01456.htm">Character Classes</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, <A HREF="DD01661.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01661.htm">Combat</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, and <A HREF="DD01656.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01656.htm">Experience</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. Be sure to read at least those three chapters before sitting down to play.

If you come to a term you do not understand, look for it in the Glossary.

If you have never played the AD&amp;D game before, the best way to learn to play
the game is to find a group of experienced players and join them. They can get
you immediately into the game and explain things as you need to know them. You
don't need to read anything beforehand. In fact, it's best if you can play the
game for several hours with experienced players before reading any of the rules.
One of the amazing things about a role-playing game is that the concept is
difficult to explain, but marvelously simple to demonstrate.

If none of your friends are involved in a game, the best place to find
experienced players is through your local hobby store. Role-playing and general gaming
clubs are common and are always eager to accept new members. Many hobby stores
offer a bulletin board through which DMs can advertise for new players and new
players can ask for information about new or ongoing games. If there is no
hobby store in your area, check at the local library or school.

If you can't find anyone else who knows the AD&amp;D game, you can teach yourself.
Read the <I>Player's Handbook</I> and create some characters. Try to create a variety of character classes.
Then pick up a pre-packaged adventure module for low-level characters, round up
two or three friends, and dive into it. You probably will make lots of mistakes
and wonder constantly whether you are doing everything wrong. Even if you are,
don't worry about it. The AD&amp;D game is big, but eventually you'll bring it under
control.
