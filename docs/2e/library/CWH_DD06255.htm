<FONT SIZE="4"><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>Five Debilitating Afflictions</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Following are several afflictions that affect only
wizards. These afflictions can occur as a result of a curse, a
side-effect of magical research, or a penalty from a wish. Assume
that an affliction can strike at any time--short of a wish, there is
no way a wizard can inoculate himself to prevent the onset of these afflictions.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Unlike some organic diseases, suffering from one of
these afflictions does not render a caster immune to future bouts
with one of these conditions. A spell caster who survives one of
these diseases is equally as likely to suffer the disease again in
the future as a caster who has never contracted the disease.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The DM can use these afflictions to temporarily
handicap a powerful PC wizard or to liven up a dreary stretch of a
campaign. Unless indicated otherwise, all afflictions can be cured by <I>cure
disease</I> or a similar spell. Unless the DM decides that a
particular affliction was a result of a magical attack or effect, <I>dispel
magic</I> will not help.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>1. Bertrek's Amnesia</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Description:</B> The wizard afflicted with
Bertrek's Amnesia has trouble remembering all of the details of his
memorized spells. Just as he attempts to cast the spell, he suddenly
forgets a crucial element of its formula, and the spell fails to
work. The onset of Bertrek's Amnesia is usually preceded by a day or
two of mild headaches. The mild headaches persist as long as the
wizard is afflicted with this condition.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Susceptibility:</B> Bertrek's Amnesia can strike
any wizard, but it seems to affect wizards with Intelligence scores
of 14 or less.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Prognosis:</B> A full day of bed rest usually cures
this condition, presuming the wizard refrains from casting spells,
studying texts, or engaging in other strenuous mental activities.
Without rest, the affliction can persist indefinitely.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>DM's Notes:</B> When a wizard is afflicted with
Bertrek's Amnesia, he must make an Intelligence Check when attempting
to cast a spell. If the check is successful, the spell is cast
normally. If he fails the check, the spell is lost in a fizzle of
useless energy and is wiped clean from the memory of the caster until
it can be rememorized.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">After every full day of rest, the DM rolls 1d20 to see
if the wizard is cured; if the roll is less than or equal to the
wizard's Intelligence score, the wizard is cured. Otherwise, the
wizard is automatically cured after he has been afflicted for 2-8
(2d4) days</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>2. Chronic Incandescence</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Description:</B> The wizard afflicted with chronic
incandescence continually radiates light from his body. The glow is
bright enough to penetrate any thickness of clothing and extends to a
radius of 20 feet. The glow persists regardless of whether the wizard
is resting, casting spells, or performing other actions.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The onset of chronic incandescence is usually preceded
by a day or two of sporadic glowing, particularly while the wizard is asleep.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Susceptibility:</B> Chronic incandescence can
strike any wizard.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Prognosis:</B> <I>Darkness</I> cast on the
afflicted wizard sometimes cancels this condition. <I>Dispel magic</I>
has also been known to work. Otherwise, the affliction usually passes
within a few days.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>DM's Notes:</B> A wizard with this affliction glows
as if affected by a 1st-level <I>light</I> spell. This does not
affect his ability to cast spells, but he will find it difficult to
hide from enemies.<I> Cure disease</I> and similar spells have no
effect on chronic incandescence. If <I>darkness, 15' radius</I> is
cast on the afflicted wizard, he can make a save vs. magic; if he
fails the check, his condition is negated. Likewise, if he fails a
check against <I>dispel magic</I>, his condition is cancelled. These
spells can only be attempted once each on an afflicted wizard. The
afflicted wizard cannot cast these spells on himself. If these spells
are unavailable, or if he successfully saves in both cases, the
condition disappears in 1-4 days</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>3. Conjuritis</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Description:</B> A wizard afflicted with conjuritis
produces bizarre and unexpected effects when attempting to cast any
conjuration or summoning spell. Usually, there is no warning of the
onset of this affliction.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Susceptibility:</B> Conjurers are the most likely
wizards to be affected, but any wizard who knows one or more conjuration/summoning
spells can be stricken with conjuritis.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Prognosis: </B>Conjuritis is difficult to treat. <I>Dispel
magic</I> has no effect on conjuritis, nor does<I> cure disease</I>
or similar spells. Fortunately, conjuritis eventually clears up after
running its course.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>DM's Notes:</B> When a wizard afflicted with
conjuritis attempts to cast any conjuration/summoning spell, the DM
rolls 1d20 and consults Table 18 for the result of the spell</FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">A wizard probably will not know that he has conjuritis
until he first experiences an unexpected result from a conjuration/summoning
spell; (that is, when he first receives one of the results numbered
1-10 on Table 18.) After he experiences this first unexpected result,
there are two ways he can be cured.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">1. As soon as the wizard casts two consecutive
conjuration/summoning spells with normal results (that is, the DM
rolls 11-20 on Table 18), he is cured of the affliction.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">2. As soon the wizard casts four normal
conjuration/summoning spells (a result of 11-20 on Table 18), he is
cured of the affliction; these spells need not be consecutive</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>4. Barlow's Blacksickness</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Description:</B> An extremely dangerous disease,
blacksickness causes the afflicted wizard to weaken every time he
attempts to cast a necromancy spell. In extreme cases, afflicted
wizards have died from this disease. The affliction is accompanied by
stomach cramps, blurred vision, and nightmares. Its onset is usually
preceded by several days of nausea.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Susceptibility:</B> Barlow's blacksickness
primarily affects necromancers. It can also strike any wizard who
knows and uses necromancy spells.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Prognosis: </B>This is a difficult affliction to
treat. Strangely, the very act of casting the spells associated with
the disease also seems to help cure it. Otherwise, the affliction can
linger anywhere from a few days to several weeks.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>DM's Notes:</B> A wizard afflicted with
blacksickness risks suffering damage whenever he casts a necromancy
spell. When an afflicted wizard casts a necromancy spell, he must
make a Constitution Check, with the level of the spell used as a
negative modifier. (For instance, if the wizard has a Constitution of
13 and casts a 4th-level necromancy spell, he adds 4 to his 1d20 roll
when he makes his Constitution Check. ) If he passes the check, there
are no ill effects. If he fails the check, he suffers 1-4 hit points
of damage. Regardless of whether he fails his Constitution Check, the
spell is cast normally.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">There are two additional side-effects of blacksickness.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">1. If the afflicted wizard suffers 6-10 hit points of
damage in the same day as a result of failing Constitution Checks
required for casting necromancy spells, he will experience wracking
nightmares when he sleeps that night. Throughout the following day,
he will experience blurred vision and stomach cramps, and will make
all attack rolls at a -2 penalty. <I>Cure disease</I> or similar
spells have no effect on this condition.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">2. If the afflicted wizard suffers 11 or more hit
points of damage in the same day as a result of failing Constitution
Checks required for casting necromancy spells, he will immediately
collapse. He will be unable to cast spells, engage in combat, or
undertake any other strenuous activities for the next 24 hours. (He
can still walk without assistance, but his movement rate is halved.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>Cure disease, dispel magic</I>, and similar spells
have no effect on blacksickness. Aside from a wish, there are two
known cures.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">1. The DM secretly rolls 2d6. This is the number of
necromancy spells the afflicted wizard must cast in order to purge
his system of the blacksickness. The necromancy spells can be of any
level; for instance, if the wizard needs to cast four spells, they
could all be 1st-level spells, they could all be 9th-level spells, or
they could be any combination of necromancy spells from any level.
Each time a necromancy spell is cast, the afflicted wizard must still
make a Constitution Check and suffer the effects as described above.
(Obviously, the wizard's health is safer if he refrains from casting
more than one or two necromancy spells in the same day.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The DM does not reveal to the wizard the total number
of spells he needs to cast to cure himself--instead, the DM should
tell the wizard that he's gradually getting better after he casts
each necromancy spell. The DM can tell the wizard that he is cured
after he has cast the last required spell, then has cast one
subsequent necromancy spell that gives him no ill effects.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">2. Blacksickness persists for 4-32 (4d8) days. The DM
should determine the length of the affliction at its outset, but not
reveal the information to the wizard. If the wizard has not yet cured
himself, the affliction is over at the end of this period.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>5. Immaterialism</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Description:</B> The wizard afflicted with
immaterialism gradually fades away until his body is transparent,
making him appear as if he were made of glass. In this condition, he
is unable to fight, cast spells, or perform any other ordinary
actions. The onset of immaterialism is preceded by a gradual
lightening of the victim's skin color.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Susceptibility:</B> Immaterialism usually strikes
illusionists, but any wizard who knows or uses illusionist spells can
be a victim.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Prognosis:</B> If treated early, immaterialism can
usually be cured with cure disease or a similar spell. However, the
condition becomes harder to treat as it progresses. Untreated,
immaterialism can last for several weeks.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>DM's Notes:</B> Immaterialism progresses over three
distinct stages, each with different symptoms. The affliction can be
cured at any stage.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">1. In Stage One, the afflicted wizard's skin turns
white, as if it had been bleached. He suffers a -1 penalty to his
Charisma, but there are no other ill effects. At this stage,
immaterialism can be cured with <I>cure disease</I> or a similar
spell; no saving throw is required. Otherwise, Stage One persists for
2-8 (2d4) days.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">2. In Stage Two, the afflicted wizard's skin remains
white, but his body has the consistency of firm gelatin. He continues
to suffer the -1 penalty to his Charisma. His natural Armor Class is
also increased to 7. Because of this improved AC, some afflicted
wizards allow their condition to advance to Stage Two before
attempting a cure. At this stage, immaterialism can be cured with <I>cure
disease</I>, but the afflicted wizard must make a saving throw vs.
spells; if the wizard succeeds in his saving throw, he resists <I>cure
disease</I> and remains afflicted with immaterialism. Untreated,
Stage Two persists for 2-8 (2d4) days.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">3. In Stage Three, the wizard and all of his gear
become insubstantial; he appears as if he were made of glass, but he
has no substance. The afflicted wizard cannot cast spells, engage in
combat, or take any other action aside from moving and speaking. He
has a -4 penalty to his Charisma. However, the wizard is affected
only by magical or special attacks, including weapons of +1 or better
(such attacks are made against the wizard's normal AC). The afflicted
wizard is able to pass through small holes or other narrow openings
as long as Stage Three persists. At this stage, immaterialism cannot
be cured with<I> cure disease</I> or any other spell short of a <I>wish</I>.
Stage Three persists for 2-8 (2d4) days</FONT></P>
