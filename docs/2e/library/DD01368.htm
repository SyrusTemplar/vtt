</B>Skills For High-Level Warriors</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
The following skills are available to fighters, rangers, and paladins who meet
the listed requirements.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Adaptation: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A character with this skill has a trained mind that quickly analyzes unusual
or unfavorable environments and a finely tuned body that can compensate for
physical impediments to fighting.
<P></P>
Warriors who use this skill successfully do not suffer combat and initiative
penalties for fighting in an unfavorable environment, most notably the +6
foreign environment penalty to initiative (see Chapter 9 of the <A HREF="PHB_DD01689.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01689.htm">Player's Handbook</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). If the environment also includes special saving throws or ability checks
due to physical conditions, such as a Dexterity/Balance check to avoid falling
off a ladder when struck in melee, characters successfully using this skill
receive a +3 (or +15%) bonus to the check.
<P></P>
The skill does not allow characters to ignore situational movement penalties,
environmental factors that are not combat related, or conditions that are
physically impossible to overcome. For example, no one can avoid sinking into
quicksand without magical aid, and resistance from water still makes slashing and
bludgeoning weapons almost useless without a <I>ring of free action </I>or a <I>free action </I>spell. Likewise, characters adapted to fighting underwater still have to find
ways to breathe.
<P></P>
The skill has no effect on penalties derived from an environment's magical
properties or on penalties based on vision or lighting. In fact, characters who
cannot observe their surroundings suffer a ?4 penalty to the skill check-it is
very hard to size up battlefield in thick fog or pitch darkness.
<P></P>
To use this skill, a character must actually enter combat in a foreign or
unfavorable environment. At the end of each round, the character checks the skill.
The skill check requires only a moment's thought and can be checked every round
until successful. It does not prevent other actions-melee attacks,
spellcasting, etc.-during the round. Once the skill succeeds, the character temporarily
ignores the environment's special effects, as described above. The effect lasts
for the entire battle plus one day per character level thereafter, and this can
be extended indefinitely if the character practices fighting in the environment
for at least eight hours a week. At an extra cost of one weapon or nonweapon
proficiency slot (or three character points), the character can become
permanently adjusted to fighting in the environment, provided the additional cost is
paid before the adaptation fades.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>All-around Attack: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A warrior with this skill is capable of launching a massive blow that can be
extended into a whirlwind physical attack that damages every enemy within reach.
<P></P>
An all-around attack must be announced in a round's player determination step
(see the <A HREF="PHB_DD01685.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01685.htm">Player's Handbook</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, Chapter 9). In the round's resolution step, the warrior makes a single
attack roll against any adjacent opponent. If the attack hits, the opponent suffers
normal damage from the blow. If the damage is sufficient to kill the opponent,
the hail of blows from the warrior automatically inflicts damage on every enemy
within a 5-foot radius, as decided by the character. Enemies who are larger
than the original target, or whose Armor Classes are better than the original
target's, are not harmed. Invisible opponents within the radius can be harmed if
their effective Armor Classes (after the ?4 bonus for <I>invisibility</I>) is not better than the original target's.
<P></P>
An all-around attack is a measure of a warrior's skill and can be made with
any type of melee weapon that the warrior is proficient with. However, opponents
that would normally be immune to the weapon used cannot be harmed in an
all-around attack. If the initial attack misses, the all-around attack fails. If the
initial attack hits, the target suffers normal from the attack. If the damage
inflicted fails to kill the original target, there is no radius effect.
<P></P>
The warrior cannot move or take another action during the round when he
attempts an all-around attack. If the <I>Player's Option: Combat &amp; Tactics </I>combat system is in use, an all-around attack cannot be used as an <A HREF="CT_DD02391.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="CT_DD02391.htm">attack of opportunity</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> or as part of a <A HREF="CT_DD02518.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="CT_DD02518.htm">heroic fray</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
Beyond determining if the initial attack succeeds, the warrior's combat
bonuses are not a factor in an all-around attack. The damaged inflicted on creatures
within the 5-foot radius varies with the warrior's level as follows:

</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Bravery:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>Warriors with this skill can harness their own strength of will to resist any
fear effect.
<P></P>
When subjected to any form of unnatural fear from a spell, creature, or
magical item, a warrior can roll a skill check. If the check succeeds, the fear
effect is negated-no saving throw is necessary. If the check fails, the warrior
still gets a saving throw if one is normally allowed. Paladins with this skill can
use it against turning attempts by evil priests.
<P></P>
This skill is a prerequisite for the captivate, frighten/challenge, and
invulnerability skills. Each time one of these skills is used, the character's base
bravery score is reduced by two for the rest of the day. Once the warrior's base
bravery score falls to zero, the character cannot use bravery or any of the
other three skills for the rest of the day.

</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Captivate:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>Warriors with this skill have developed a strong personal presence that is
attractive to members of their own races.
<P></P>
Even without a skill roll, children, members of the opposite sex, and other
warriors tend to be friendly toward the character provided they are of the same
race and their alignments are similar to that of the character. For purposes of
this skill, alignments are similar when they share one common element: law,
neutrality, chaos, good, or evil.
<P></P>
Friendly nonplayer characters tend to pay attention to the warrior and view
what the warrior says or does in a favorable light as long as it is not obviously
harmful or contrary to local customs. With a minimum of encouragement, a
friendly NPC gives the warrior information, performs simple errands, makes
introductions, and so on. The warrior is a celebrity in the friendly character's eyes.
<P></P>
The warrior can attempt a skill roll to make a suggestion (as the 3rd-level
wizard spell) to a friendly NPC if the warrior can speak to the person privately
for a few minutes. The NPC automatically obeys the suggestion if it does not
involve risk, loss, or potential embarrassment; otherwise, a save vs. spell
applies. If the warrior gives the NPC an appropriate gift of modest value or does a
useful favor, the saving throw is made at a ?4 penalty. If the saving throw
succeeds, the NPC tries to flee from the warrior's presence. Each attempt to plant
a <I>suggestion </I>reduces the warrior's base bravery score by two. Once the base bravery score
falls to zero, the warrior's captivate skill is lost for the day.
<P></P>
Creatures with 8 or more Hit Dice/levels are immune to this skill's effects.
Any hostile act or threat by the warrior-including a failed suggestion-breaks
this skill's effects.
<P></P>
If the warrior spends an extended period of time (a few hours or more) in
personal contact with a single NPC who is susceptible to this skill, the DM can
secretly roll a skill check. If the check succeeds, the NPC forms an attachment to
the character and acts upon the attachment in some way. More often than not,
these attachments prove to be troublesome to the character. A few suggestions
are listed below:
<P></P>
<P></P>
Stows away in the PC's baggage.
<P></P>
Offers to serve the warrior.
<P></P>
Brags about relationship with hero.
<P></P>
Undertakes a dangerous task on the PC's behalf.
<P></P>
Unfavorably compares a powerful local figure-perhaps a deity-with the
character.
<P></P>
Steals a trinket or minor item from the hero.
<P></P>
Seeks marriage with (or adoption by) the PC.
<P></P>
Claims to be the warrior's spouse or offspring.
<P></P>
Presents PC with an apparently useless gift.

</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Death Blow: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This skill allows warriors to strike deadly blows that can fell an opponent in
a single stroke.
<P></P>
A death blow must be announced in a round's player determination step. In the
round's resolution step, the warrior makes a single attack roll against any
adjacent opponent. If the attack hits, the opponent suffers normal damage from the
blow and must save vs. death magic or be slain immediately. The opponent-s
defensive bonuses from protective devices (such as magical armor and <I>rings of protection</I>) always apply to the saving throw. If the DM wishes, the optional saving
throw modifiers from <A HREF="DD01168.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01168.htm">Table 36</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> or from <A HREF="DD01357.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01357.htm">Table 38</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> can be used as well.
<P></P>
Opponents with more Hit Dice/levels than the warrior are immune to the effect.
Creatures that would not normally be vulnerable to damage from the weapon the
warrior is using in the attack also are immune.
<P></P>
When a warrior attempts a death blow, that is the only attack a warrior can
make during the round. Attacks of opportunity (see <A HREF="CT_DD02391.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="CT_DD02391.htm">Combat &amp; Tactics</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, Chapter 1) are allowed, however, and a warrior can combine a death blow with
an all-around attack. Only the initial target of the all-around attack is
subject to the instant death effect, but this might allow the all-around attack to
succeed when it otherwise might not.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Frighten/Challenge: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Warriors with this skill can turn their personal energies outward, producing
an aura of fright that forces fairly weak creatures to flee. This skill also
allows warriors to issue challenges that draw powerful creatures into personal
combat.
<P></P>
To create an aura of fright, the warrior must shout and charge a group of
creatures of 4 Hit Dice/levels or less. The creatures must be able to see and hear
the warrior to be affected. The warrior makes a skill roll, and, if it
succeeds, the creatures scatter, fleeing for as long as the character pursues them. The
creatures flee for 1d10 additional rounds after pursuit ends.
<P></P>
Undead and creatures with no morale scores, such as conjured or summoned
creatures under the control of a spellcaster, are not affected. Creatures gain a
saving throw vs. spell if they are within 30 feet of a friendly creature that is
immune to the aura. A cloak of bravery spell negates the effect.
<P></P>
If the skill roll is a 20, the affected creatures attack the warrior instead.
If the warrior flees, the creatures pursue as long as they can see him. If the
warrior attacks, the creatures automatically pass any morale checks they might
be required to make for the next 1d10 rounds.
<P></P>
To issue a <I>challenge</I>, the warrior must be able to speak to the target creature, which must have
least 10 Hit Dice or levels. The creature must be close enough to see the warrior
(about 100 yards if the light and visibility are good) and be able to
understand what the warrior says. The skill check is an opposed roll using the
warrior's Charisma/Leadership score and the target's Wisdom/Willpower score. If the
character wins the opposed roll, the affected creature must immediately advance
and engage the warrior in physical combat unless restrained by another creature
(restraint breaks the compulsion to attack, but keeps the creatures involved
occupied for a full round). Creatures that are unwilling to fight can attempt to
save vs. spell each round to break off the fight, otherwise, they engage in
melee combat with the warrior. The affected creature can employ spells or missile
weapons if it wishes, but it must close to melee range before doing so.
<P></P>
If the target creature has no Wisdom/Willpower score. use <A HREF="DD01245.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01245.htm">Table 10</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> (page 59) to generate one or use the creature's Intelligence rating. The
circumstances surrounding the challenge can alter the opposed die roll as follows:
<P></P>
<P></P>
?6 to the skill score if the player makes no attempt to role-play the
challenge. For example, the player says -I challenge the dragon.-
<P></P>
<P></P>
?4 to the skill score if the player makes only a feeble attempt to role-play
the challenge. -Why don-t you stop flying around and just fight you stupid
dragon??
<P></P>
<P></P>
+1 to the opponent's Wisdom/Willpower score for every companion accompanying
the warrior.
<P></P>
<P></P>
+1 to the opponent's Wisdom/Willpower score if it has suffered any damage,
and an additional +1 for every 10% of its original hit points it has lost.
<P></P>
<P></P>
+10 to the opponent's Wisdom/Willpower score if the creature has weak combat
powers (THAC0 14 or higher, Armor Class 2 or worse, no physical attack that
inflicts more than 6 hit points of damage).
<P></P>
<P></P>
Any roll of 20 is a failure, regardless of the modified score. If both the
warrior and the opponent fail their ability checks, the warrior issuing the
challenge suffers a loss of confidence and must retreat into cover-or move away from
the target at top speed for a full round if no cover is available. The warrior
stays away for 1d4 rounds. The bravery skill can be used to avoid this
mandatory retreat.
<P></P>
The warrior is free to move and attack normally during the round when the
skill roll or ability check is made. Each use of either form of this skill lowers
the warrior's bravery skill by one for the rest of the day (each attempt
depletes the warriors inner strength slightly). This skill cannot be used once the
bravery skill falls to zero.
<P></P>
A fighter can use his intimidation gaze while issuing a challenge, but only if
the opponent is within range when the challenge is issued.

</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hardiness: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Warriors with this skill can use their inner strength to temporarily delay the
harmful effects of special attacks, but not physical damage. If given
sufficient time to rest, this skill allows warriors to recover from such attacks
without additional aid.
<P></P>
When subjected to a harmful special effect from a spell, creature, or magical
item, a warrior can roll a skill check. If the check succeeds, the effect is
delayed for the period of time shown on the table below. If the check fails, the
warrior suffers the effect normally. If the effect allows a saving throw, the
warrior rolls the save before checking this skill.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
Hardiness does not delay simple damage from any source, including continuing
damage, such as <I>Melf's acid arrow </I>or a <I>sword of wounding</I>, or special forms of purely physical damage, such as severed limbs or broken
bones. Nor does this skill protect against effects that are not directly
harmful, such as magical charms, entanglement, or imprisonment.
<P></P>
If the skill succeeds, the warrior suffers no harm from the effect until the
delay ends, but he is aware of what the effect is. If the warrior receives the
appropriate cure before the delay ends, there is no harm to the character. If
the harmful effect's duration is shorter than the delay there also is no effect.
<P></P>
For example, a 17th-level fighter with 34 hit points left (from a total of
115) is battling a wizard who casts power word kill on him. After making his
hardiness skill roll, he delays the effects of the spell for five rounds. Two rounds
later, after killing the wizard, the party priest casts heal on him. When the
delay effect is over, the power word kill effect occurs, but his hit points are
now over 60 and he is immune to the spell. If the priest had not healed him,
he could have lapsed into unconsciousness in an effort to avoid the effect of
the power word, as detailed below.
<P></P>
If the harmful effect has not expired or been cured when the delay ends, the
warrior must either suffer the full force of the effect or lapse into
unconsciousness while the character's body struggles to resist. The length of time the
character remains unconsciousness depends on the extent of the injury, as noted
on the table below.

<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Minor: </I>These effects impair-but do not incapacitate-the character, such as blindness,
deafness, and ability score reductions. Spells such as <I>antipathy/sympathy </I>(antipathy effect), <I>cause blindness/deafness, color spray </I>(most of the time), <I>contagion</I>, and <I>holy word </I>are examples of minor effects.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Severe: </I>Includes effects that incapacitate or completely transform the character, such
as petrification, polymorphing, and death. Severe spell effects include <I>hold person, phantasmal killer, polymorph other, power word kill</I>, and <I>power word stun</I>.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Extreme: </I>Includes effects that wrench the character's very being, such as energy drains
(per level drained) and magical aging (per year aged). Two notable examples
include the 9th-level wizard spell <I>energy drain </I>and the 6th-level priest spell age creature from the <A HREF="TM_DD04363.htm#1095fb05"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="TM_DD04363.htm#1095fb05">Tome of Magic</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
<P></P>
At the end of the recovery time, the character attempts a system shock roll.
If the roll succeeds, the character awakens-fully healed-and the effects of the
delayed magic are nullified. If the roll fails, the character awakens, but
suffers the full force of the effect. Thus, it is possible for a character to rest
for months and then wake up only to die from the effects of the delayed magic.
<P></P>
For instance, if our fighter from the above example had decided to sleep off
the effects of the <I>power word kill</I>, he would have been unconscious for a week. The player rolls the character-s
system shock roll (17 Constitution) and rolls 98%?1% over what he needed. Since
the power word would have killed him at the time he lapsed into
unconsciousness, the character awakens just long enough to be killed by the spell.
<P></P>
If a character is suffering from multiple effects, the character makes system
shock rolls at the end of each recovery period. The player can choose the order
in which the checks are made, but the character does not awaken until checks
have been made for all the effects. For example, a character who was drained by
a vampire and paralyzed by a lich remains unconscious for nine weeks-one month
to revive from each of the two levels the vampire drained and another week for
the paralysis.
<P></P>
If an appropriate cure is applied while the character is unconscious, the
character recovers immediately and automatically. For instance, the fighter
sleeping off the effects of the <I>power word kill </I>spell from the previous example would recover after receiving healing
sufficient to raise his hit points above 60.
<P></P>
<I>Heroic Effort: </I>As a last-ditch effort to continue a battle, a fighter can use the hardiness
skill to extend his life. Instead of dying at zero hit points (or falling
unconscious at zero hit points and dying at ?10 if the optional <I>Hovering at Death's Door </I>rule is in play), a warrior who makes a successful hardiness check can
continue fighting until reaching ?20 hit points. The character can function in this
state for a number of rounds equal to his delay effect, suffering the appropriate
consequences for reduced hit points at the end of the delay.
<P></P>
Use of this skill is not without its drawbacks, however. If the warrior is
reduced to ?20 hit points or less, the character is struck unconscious and dies
once the delay expires. Once a character's hit points drop to ?20 or less, death
is inevitable at the end of the delay period unless unusual conditions exist
(see below).
<P></P>
Curative spells can allow a warrior struck unconscious by being reduced ?20
hit points or less to rejoin a battle, but death still occurs at the end of the
delay period. A <I>raise dead </I>or <I>resurrection </I>spell cast during the delay period prevents death from occurring.
<P></P>
It is possible that a character with the ability to regenerate (from a magical
item or high Constitution score) can continue fighting even after being
reduced to ?20 hit points or less. If regeneration increases the warrior's hit points
to ?19 or more during the delay period, the character regains consciousness
and does not die if he receives enough healing to restore him to positive hit
points before the delay ends. Even if death occurs, regeneration usually restores
a character much more quickly than the rest period the hardiness skill
requires. A character returned to life through regeneration need not make a system
shock roll.
<P></P>
An <I>amulet of life protection </I>also allows a warrior to continue fighting after being reduced to ?20 hit
points or less if the character receives sufficient healing to restore him to ?19
hit points or more. The character still lapses back into death at the end of the
delay period, but any form of magical healing can restore him to life (see <A HREF="DD01280.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01280.htm">page 79</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) and no system shock roll is required.
<P></P>
Each use of the hardiness skill lowers the warrior's base bravery score by two
for the rest of the day. The skill is ineffective if the character's base
bravery score has been reduced to zero or less.

By concentrating for one round and making a successful skill check, the
warrior can improve one of the three eligible ability scores to the value listed on
the table below. The improvement lasts one round per character level. Because
the majority of the character's energy is directed to the improved ability score,
the other two ability scores are reduced by two for the same duration.
Reductions lower scores by two full points; an extraordinary Strength score
(18/01?18/00) is reduced to 16. The warrior can end the boost-and restore the values of
the other scores-at any time. If the character's ability score is already higher
than the value listed on the table, this skill has no effect. If the optional

The warrior can take no other actions during the round spent concentrating on
raising the selected ability score. Each attempt, successful or not, during a
single day lowers the base skill score by two. The skill cannot be used once the
base score falls to zero or less.
<P></P>
Bonuses are applied immediately when the skill succeeds and are lost
immediately when the boost's duration ends. For example, a warrior who chooses to
increase Constitution immediately gains bonus hit points but loses them again when
the character's Constitution score returns to normal. Likewise, the effects from
reduced ability scores are applied immediately but then restored when the
improvement ends.
<P></P>
A character can have only one ability score improvement from this skill
operating at any given time.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sense Danger:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>This skill allows warriors to discover threats that are not obvious to less
perceptive characters.
<P></P>
The sense danger skill is actually five different subskills, as outlined
below. The number of subskills the warrior knows depends on the character's level:
one subskill at 15th?19th level, two at 20th?24th level, three at 25th?29th
level, and four subskills at 30th level or higher. If the character purchases this
skill twice, the warrior gains one extra subskill. Any improvement to the skill
number improves all the subskills the character knows.
<P></P>
Each subskill gives the warrior the ability to detect danger in a different
form:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Ambushes: </I>The warrior can determine if hidden enemies are lurking in any area the
character can see well (see Table 62 in the <A HREF="PHB_DD01768.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01768.htm">Player's Handbook</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). The warrior can scan an area roughly 200 yards square in a single round. An
area can be scanned only once each turn, and a successful check reveals
approximately how many creatures are hiding in the area and their approximate size.
<P></P>
<I>Attack Readiness: </I>With a successful skill check, the warrior can tell if a creature is prepared
to attack. The skill does not tell the anything about the other being's actual
intentions, just its readiness for combat. For example, a creature that is
prepared for combat might attack soon, or it might simply be ready to respond to a
hostile action. In one round, the warrior can determine the battle-readiness of
every being in a 30-foot cube.
<P></P>
The warrior can also study a single creature to determine if it has any
concealed weapons. A successful check reveals any hidden weapons (tucked into
clothing, hidden nearby, etc). If faced with an unknown creature, a successful skill
check allows the warrior to determine what its attack modes are (claws, teeth,
etc.).
<P></P>
When the warrior detects a concealed weapon with this skill, the character
notes its general size, location, and type-a sap tucked into the back of a
character's breeches or a dagger hidden in a sleeve, for example. The character learns
nothing else about the weapon. Note that the warrior must be aware of the
creature before checking for concealed weapons. The warrior cannot detect weapons
hidden by illusions or other magical means.
<P></P>
<I>Back Attacks: </I>When an enemy launches an attack at the warrior from the rear, the character
can attempt a skill check to detect the assault. Success negates any chance for
surprise and all special bonuses the attacker might gain from a rear attack,
including a thief's backstab bonuses. A successful check allows the warrior to
apply defensive bonuses from a high Dexterity/Balance score, even if the
character does not turn to meet the attack. Shield bonuses are not applicable unless
the character turns around. Unlike the barbarian's back protection ability (see <I>The Complete Barbarian's Handbook</I>, Chapter 1), this skill does not allow the warrior to make a free
counterattack.
<P></P>
<I>Hidden Enemies: </I>The warrior has a sixth sense about hidden enemies in the immediate vicinity.
Once a round, the character can make a skill check. If successful, the warrior
learns the location of all invisible, ethereal, astral, out of phase, or hidden
creatures within a 30-foot radius. The character does not know how the
creature's are hidden-an ethereal creature is indistinguishable from an invisible
one-but the character notes their locations and can track their movements so long
as they remain within the radius. The warrior suffers a +1 initiative penalty on
the round when he uses this ability.
<P></P>
This subskill does not reveal disguised creatures in plain sight or the
intentions of creatures. For example, a golem posing as a statue is not revealed, nor
can the character determine if an NPC is secretly hostile.
<P></P>
<I>Size Up Opponent: </I>With a successful skill check, the warrior can study a single creature each
round and determine how dangerous the creature would be in physical combat. It
does not give the warrior any indication of a creature's magical abilities,
innate spell-like powers, breath weapons, and the like. If a creature's hit points
and THAC0 qualify it for more than one category, the DM is free to choose which
one the warrior detects.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Low: </I>The creature's hit point total is 20% or less than the warrior's, and its
THAC0 is at least 15 points higher.
<P></P>
<I>Moderate: </I>The creature has 21?50% of the warrior's hit points or its THAC0 is at least
10 points higher.
<P></P>
<I>Significant: </I>The creature has 51?70% of the warrior's hit points, and its THAC0 is at least
5 points higher.
<P></P>
<I>Dangerous: </I>The creature has 71?100% of the warrior's hit points, and its THAC0 is less
than 5 points higher, but not lower.
<P></P>
<I>Deadly: </I>The creature has more hit points and a lower THAC0 than the warrior.
<P></P>
<P></P>
With any subskill, the DM should roll the check secretly. If the roll fails on
a roll of 19 or less, the character detects nothing. If the roll fails on a
20, the character gets a false indication-sensing an invisible figure where there
is none, improperly sizing up an opponent, etc. A false indication has no
effect on a back attack.
<P></P>
If the character also has the alertness proficiency, the character receives a
+1 bonus to his skill score.

</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Signature Item:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>A warrior with this skill chooses an item from the character's collection of
equipment as a personal trademark that is specially protected from twists of
fate.
<P></P>
The warrior designates a signature item by giving it a name and noting
something distinctive about it. If the item has no distinguishing features, the
character must hire an artisan with the appropriate skill-such as a weaponsmith for a
sword-to add one. The alteration could be as simple as engraving the item-s
name somewhere upon its surface or as elaborate as the character desires (and can
afford). No skill check is required to designate an item, and as soon as the
item is designated, described, and named, the warrior forms an empathic link
with it. It is possible to have more than one signature item, but the character
must pay the full cost of this skill for each item. If the warrior improves the
skill score, the improvement applies to all the character's signature equipment.
<P></P>
A signature item must be something the character has owned for an extended
period of time and uses regularly. For example, a warrior cannot designate a
friendly wizard's favorite spell book as a signature item. The DM is free to decide
how long the character must own the item, but one level's worth of advancement
is the usual period. Likewise, the DM must decide what constitutes regular use,
but at least once during the majority of the character's adventures is the
usual requirement. Only nonconsumable items can be signature items, but
rechargeable items qualify.
<P></P>
If a signature item is ever required to roll an item saving throw (see the <A HREF="DMG_DD00330.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00330.htm">Dungeon Master Guide</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, Chapter 6), it automatically succeeds so long as the owner is carrying the
item and the survives the event. For example, if Tana is subjected to a <I>fireball </I>and fails her saving throw vs. spell, all her equipment must save vs. magical
fire or be destroyed. Tana's signature sword, <I>Windsinger</I>, does not have to roll the item saving throw, it succeeds automatically.
<P></P>
Deliberate actions that lead to item saving throws can destroy a signature
item. For example, if Tana uses <I>Windsinger </I>as a brace to keep a trap from closing, the sword can break. Likewise, if an
attacker deliberately targets a disintegrate spell at <I>Windsinger</I>, the sword can also be destroyed. Deliberate actions can destroy a signature
item even if the owner is not aware of the danger. For example, if Tana slashes
at what she thinks is a giant spider, but the creature is really a rust
monster, <I>Windsinger </I>could be destroyed.
<P></P>
If the character does not survive the event that caused the item saving throw,
the item must make the roll normally. If the item survives the incident and
the character is restored to life, the link is automatically reestablished. If
the item is destroyed in the same event that killed the warrior, the link is
broken.
<P></P>
If a signature item is ever lost or stolen, the link with the item allows the
warrior to attempt a skill check once a day to receive a vision of the item-s
location. If successful, the character receives a visual image of the item-s
current surroundings and has a vague idea of the location's distance and
direction. If the item lies on another plane, the warrior receives a vision of the
plane, but can discern no other information unless he actually travels to the plane.
If the item is magically hidden, the warrior learns this fact, along with the
item's general location. For example, he would know that his signature item is
hidden in King Snurre's great hall.
<P></P>
If a signature item is destroyed or irrecoverable, the character can use the
link to obtain a replacement. This does not apply if both the signature item and
the character were destroyed by the same event. If the signature item was
nonmagical, the character need only acquire a similar item and give it the same
name as the original. The character forms a link with the new item, which
gradually begins to resemble the original until it becomes indistinguishable from the
original after about one month.
<P></P>
If the item was magical, the character must obtain an item of quality (see the <A HREF="DMG_DD00316.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00316.htm">Dungeon Master Guide</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, Chapter 6) and roll a skill check. If the check succeeds, the link is strong
enough to recreate the item. The character loses five times the item-s
experience point value and the nonmagical item is miraculously infused with an
enchantment that exactly matches the original item after about one month. If the
character is unwilling to pay the experience cost, the link is broken instead. If a
magical item similar to the original item is used instead of an item of
quality, its experience value is subtracted from warrior's experience loss. Artifacts
cannot be restored in this manner, though the character gains the other
benefits of the link.
<P></P>
Voluntarily giving away or not making a reasonable effort to recover a
signature item that has been lost or stolen always breaks the link. The DM is the
final judge of what constitutes a reasonable effort at recovery.
<P></P>
Warriors can have one signature item from each of the following categories:
armor, weapon, shield, and miscellaneous magical item. Each signature item
requires the expenditure of the appropriate number of proficiency slots or character
points. At the DM's option, pairs of magical items might also qualify as a
single signature item, such as the <I>twin blades of Ra</I>.

</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Signature Mount: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A warrior with this skill forms a special bond with a mount. When they are
together, the mount gains considerable protection from attacks that might
otherwise kill it.
<P></P>
A signature mount cannot have more than 10 Hit Dice and must have at least
four hit points per Hit Die. For example, a heavy war horse has 5+5 hit dice; it
cannot become a signature mount unless it has at least 25 hit points. The mount
must be tamed and recognize the warrior as its master. If the creature has an
Intelligence score of 5 or more, it need not be trained if it willingly serves
the warrior. The warrior must name the mount and provide it with something that
makes it recognizable. This can be as simple as purchasing a saddle with the
mount's name engraved in it or as elaborate as the character can afford.
<P></P>
When the link is established, the mount immediately gains one hit point per
level of the character plus an additional hit point each time the warrior gains a
level. When the warrior is riding the mount, the mount suffers no damage from
area attacks (such as breath weapons and <I>fireballs</I>) if the rider successfully saves against the attack. If the rider fails the
saving throw but survives the attack, the mount saves for half or no damage,
using the rider's saving throw number. The mount also gains the rider's saving
throw against effects targeted directly at it (such as <I>disintegrate </I>and the cold ray form of <I>Otiluke's freezing sphere</I>) as long as the rider is with the mount. Attacks such as power word spells
must be potent enough to overcome the rider to have any effect, although they
affect only the mount if that is where they are targeted. If the mount is alone,
or the rider does not survive the attack, the mount must use its own saving
throw number, and it suffers the normal effects from the attack.
<P></P>
If a signature mount is ever killed, the warrior can acquire a new one of the
same type and hit points. Each day, the character can attempt a skill check to
receive a vision of the new mount. If the check succeeds, the character sees
the mount in its current surroundings and knows the approximate direction and
distance to the location. If the mount is on another plane, the warrior receives a
vision of the plane but can discern no other information unless the character
actually travels to the plane. If the mount is magically hidden, the warrior
learns this fact, along with the mount's general location. It is up to the
character to seek out the replacement mount, but the mount willingly serves the
warrior if the character obtains it.
<P></P>
A warrior can have one signature mount for each different type of terrain. For
example, the character might have a young adult mercury dragon (airborne),
heavy war horse (land), and a giant sea horse (water). Subterranean and desert
mounts might also be allowed, at the DM's option. Each signature mount requires
the expenditure of the appropriate number of proficiency slots or skill points.
