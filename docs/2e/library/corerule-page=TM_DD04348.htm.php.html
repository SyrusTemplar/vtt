This spell prevents the entry of all elementals into the area of effect.
Further, elementals outside the area of effect cannot make physical attacks against
those inside. Spells and missile attacks can be cast into the area by
elementals.
<P></P>
The spell affects a cube whose sides equal the caster's level times 5 feet (a
12th-level priest could affect an area equal to a 60' x 60'x 60' cube).
<P></P>
<I>Elemental forbiddance</I> has no effect on elementals that are within the area of effect when the spell
is cast. If such elementals leave the area of effect, they cannot reenter.
<P></P>
The material components are the priest's holy symbol and four glass beads,
each of a different color (green, blue, red, and yellow). The priest must pace out
the perimeter of the warded area at the time of casting.
