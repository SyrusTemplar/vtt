Three experts, the assassin, spy, and sage, require special treatment. Each of
these, unlike other hirelings, can affect the direction and content of an
on-going adventure. Used carefully and sparingly, these three are valuable DM tools
to create and shape stories in a role-playing campaign.

Assassination is not a discreet occupation per se, but a reprehensible
mind-set. The assassin requires no special skills, though fighting, stealth, and even
magic are useful. All that is really needed to be an assassin is the desire and
the opportunity.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hiring an Assassin:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When a player character hires an assassin (which is <I>not</I> a good or lawful act), he is taking a chance. There is virtually no way to
assure oneself of the reliability and dependability of such a person. Anyone
willing to make a business out of murder is not likely to have a high degree of
morals of any type. Clearly, this is a case of &quot;let the buyer beware!&quot;
<P></P>
Once a character has hired an assassin, it is up to the DM to determine the
success of the deed. There are no simple tables or formulae to be followed.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Consider the intended victim:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Assassination attempts by one player character against another should not be
allowed. This type of behavior only leads to bitterness, bickering, and anger
among the players. NPC-sponsored assassination attempts against player characters
should be used sparingly, and then only as plot motivators, not as punishment
or player controls. Any time a player character is targeted, role-play the
encounter fairly—give the PC a chance.
<P></P>
If the intended victim is an NPC, the DM should decide the effect of the
assassination on his game. Sometimes, player characters do these things out of
spite. At other times the deed may be motivated by simple greed. Neither of these is
a particularly good motive to encourage in a campaign.
<P></P>
If the death of the NPC would result in a major reworking of the campaign for
no good reason, consider seriously the idea of making the attempt fail. If the
death of the NPC would allow the player characters to by-pass or breeze through
an adventure you have planned, then it's not a good idea. Don't just tell the
players, &quot;Oh, that'd be bad for the game so you can't even try to knock that
guy off.&quot; Work the attempt—and its failure—into the storyline.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Precautions:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">If you decide the attempt is legitimate, consider the precautions the intended
NPC victim normally takes. These may make the job particularly difficult or
easy. Kings, emperors, high priests, and other important officials tend to be
very cautious and well-protected. Wizards, with wise magical precautions, can be
virtually impossible to assassinate! Devise specific NPC precautions before you
know the assassin's plans.
<P></P>
Wizards make use of <I>magic mouth, alarm, explosive runes,</I> and other trap spells. Priests often rely on divination-oriented items to
foresee the intentions of others. Both could have extra-dimensional or
other-planar servants and guards. They may also have precautions to foil common spells
such as <I>ESP, clairvoyance,</I> and <I>detect magic.</I> Kings, princes, and other nobles have the benefit of both magical and
clerical protection in addition to a host of possibly fanatically loyal bodyguards. If
the victim has advance warning or suspects an attempt, further precautions may
be taken, and the job can become even more difficult.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>The Plan:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">After you have decided (secretly) what precautions are reasonable, have the
player describe the plan he thinks would work best. This can be simple or
involved, depending on the cunning of the player. This is the plan the assassin, not
the player character, will use, therefore the player can presume some resources
not available to the player character. However, you must decide if these
resources are reasonable and truly exist.
<P></P>
For example, if the player says the assassin has a map of the castle, you must
tell him if this is reasonable (and, unless the victim is extremely secretive
and paranoid, it is). A plan involving a thousand men or an 18th-level thief is
not reasonable. The player character hasn't hired an entire arsenal!
<P></P>
Finally, compare what you know of the precautions to the plan and the success
or failure will usually become clear. Ultimately, the DM should not allow
assassinations to succeed if he doesn't want them to succeed!
<P></P>
In general, allowing player characters to hire assassins should not be
encouraged. Hiring an NPC to kill even a horrible villain defeats the purpose of
heroic role-playing. If the player characters can't accomplish the deed, why should
they be allowed to hire NPCs to do the same thing?
<P></P>
Overuse of assassins can often result in bitter feelings and outright
feuding—player vs. player or player vs DM. Neither of these is fun or healthy for a
game. Finally, it is a very risky business. Assassins do get caught and generally
have no compunctions about confessing who their employer is. Once the target
learns this, the player character will have a very dangerous life. Then the
player character can discover the joy and excitement of having assassins looking for
him!
