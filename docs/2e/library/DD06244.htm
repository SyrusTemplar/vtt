By means of <I>choke</I>, the caster causes a pair of ghostly hands to appear around the throat of a
single victim. The victim must be a human, demihuman, or humanoid, and must be
within 30 yards of the caster. The hands will choke and strangle the affected
victim for the duration of the spell; each round, the victim suffers 1-4 hit
points of damage from the choking hands. If the victim makes a successful saving
throw, he suffers half-damage each round.
<P></P>
<I>Choke</I> can be negated by <I>dispel magic</I> or a similar spell; the victim cannot wrench the ethereal hands away from his
neck. The victim makes all attack rolls at a -2 penalty while affected by <I>choke</I>.
<P></P>
The material component for this spell is a handkerchief or similarly-sized
piece of cloth that has been tied in a knot

This spell enables the caster to visualize the final minutes of the life of
any creature or person that died within the previous 24 hours. When the caster
touches the subject's corpse, the caster goes into a trance. The caster then has
a vision of the final 10 minutes of the subject's life as seen by the subject
himself. The vision ends with the last scene the subject saw before he died, at
which time the caster awakens from his trance and the spell is over.
<P></P>
The material component for this spell is a fragment from a shattered mirror

By use of this spell, the caster can determine if a creature is alive,
including creatures in a coma or trance, or under the influence of <I>feign death</I>. Any form of mental protection prevents the effectiveness of this spell, as
does any thickness of metal. An inch of stone or wood is treated as 10 feet of
open space for the purpose of determining whether the spell functions.
<P></P>
The material components for this spell are a holy symbol and a hair from the
head of a newborn animal

This spell creates an invisible globe of protection that filters out all
noxious elements from poisonous vapors; therefore, a creature protected by <I>filter</I> takes no damage and suffers no penalties from poison gas of any kind,
including those created magically (such as <I>stinking cloud</I>). The exceptions are poisonous vapors created by a dragon's breath weapon
(such as the chlorine gas of a green dragon); in these cases, the creature
protected by filter suffers half-damage.
<P></P>
The material components for this spell are a strand of spider web and a scrap
of cotton cloth approximately one inch square

When this spell is in effect, the caster's touch causes any single human,
dwarf, gnome, half-elf, or halfling to become rigid for 3-8 (1d6 +2) rounds unless
the victim makes a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation. Additionally, the
paralyzed victim exudes a carrion stench in a 10-foot radius that causes
retching and nausea. Those within this area who fail to save vs. poison will make
their attacks with a -2 penalty until the spell reaches the end of its duration.
<P></P>
The material component for this spell is a small scrap of cloth taken from the
clothing of a ghoul or a pinch of earth from a ghoul's lair.

Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: Special

This spell fires a dagger of ice at the target. The caster makes a normal
attack roll as if attacking with a missile weapon, factoring in the range from the
attacker to the target (the <I>ice knife</I> has a long range of 30 yards, a medium range of 20 yards, and a short range
of 10 yards). A successful hit causes 2-8 (2d4) hit points of damage. If the <I>ice knife</I> misses its target, consult the rules for grenade-like missiles on pages 62-63
of the <I>Dungeon Master's Guide</I> to determine where it lands.
<P></P>
When an <I>ice knife</I> strikes a solid object or a creature, the knife shatters, releasing a wave of
numbing cold. All creatures within a 5-foot radius must make a successful
saving throw vs. paralyzation or suffer 1-4 hit points of cold damage and become
numb for 1-3 rounds. Numbed creatures have their movement rates reduced by half
and their chance to hit reduced by 2. Proximity to major sources of heat, such
as a roaring bonfire, improves a creature's saving throw by +2.
<P></P>
An <I>ice knife</I> that misses or is lost cannot be picked up by the caster (or anyone else) and
thrown again. If the<I> ice knife</I> is touched, it instantly shatters, releasing a wave of cold as described
above. If a lost <I>ice knife</I> is not touched, it melts away in a pool of water 1 round after it was
originally created; this melting occurs regardless of the environmental temperature.
<P></P>
The material components for this spell are a drop of water from melted snow
and a tiny silver dagger.

This spell allows the recipient to cast spells that normally require a verbal
component without the caster needing to make a sound. Such spells must be cast
within the duration of the <I>vocalize</I> spell. This spell is also useful in situations where quiet is desired, or
when the recipient is under the influence of a silence spell.
<P></P>
<I>Vocalize</I> does not negate a silence spell, but merely offsets it for the purpose of
spell casting; if a spell caster under the effect of <I>vocalize</I> casts a spell that has some audible effect, that sound will be masked for as
long as <I>silence </I>remains in force. <I>Vocalize</I> does not affect normal vocal communication.
<P></P>
The material component for this spell is a small golden bell without a clapper
