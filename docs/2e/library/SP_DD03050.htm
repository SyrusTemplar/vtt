can supervise the recovery of themselves and others. If the characters tend a
wound on the round immediately after it is inflicted, a successful proficiency
check means that 1d3 points of damage have been restored (to a maximum of the
damage inflicted the previous round). If they tend a wound within one hour of its
infliction, they can heal 1 point with a successful check. No character can
benefit from this proficiency more than once a day.

This proficiency can also help with long-term healing and resisting poison and
disease; these procedures are detailed in the <A HREF="PHB_DD01743.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="PHB_DD01743.htm">Playerâ€™s Handbook</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">.
