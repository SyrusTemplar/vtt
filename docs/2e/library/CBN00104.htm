<I>Bind undead</I> is highly effective against certain kinds of undead (it has no effect on
living creatures). This spell automatically affects all chosen corporeal undead of
6+ or less HD (including coffer corpses, crypt things, ghouls, ghasts, great
ghuls, huecuva, mummies, all types of skeletons, sons of Kyuss, wights, and all
manner of zombies), with no saving throw. Such creatures curl into a ball (if
more than one undead is affected, they are all gathered into one tightly-packed
sphere). Affected undead are held helpless and immobile, their special abilities
in stasis, until the spell expires or the caster frees them. The diameter of
this ball of undead is typically 2?3 feet per affected creature. Typically, this
?boneball? is rolled off a cliff or into an obstacle or fire, or conveyed into
the midst of foes, whereupon the caster ends the magic, freeing the undead to
fight.
<P></P>
Against noncorporeal undead (such as ghosts and spectres) and all undead of 7
or more HD who don?t turn as ?Special? (including vampires and liches), <I>bind undead</I> acts only as a <I>slow</I> spell. These undead are entitled to a saving throw vs. spells to resist the
effect. <I>Bind undead</I> does not effect ?Special? undead. The material component is the bone of any
creature, held in the wizard?s left hand at the time of casting.
