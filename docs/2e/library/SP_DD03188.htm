physically touching them, or travel across vast distances in an instant. This
chapter explains the game mechanics used to run psionic characters and provides
enough powers to get wild talent and psionicist heroes started. Consider the
definitions of the following terms:
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Psionics:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The practice of extraordinary psychic powers. A character who has psionic
abilities harnesses the power of his or her mind to produce a particular effect.
Characters who have psionic powers are either psionicists or wild talents.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Psionicist:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character who uses the force of his or her mind to affect the environment
and inhabitants around them.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wild Talent:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character from any class who has a natural psionic ability and at least one
psionic power.
<P></P>
The psionic system presented in this chapter provides descriptions of the core
powers. This chapter presents the same psionics rules that appear in the
revised Dark Sun boxed set.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">What's Different?
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> If players are new to psionics, skip this section because the changes to the
original rules from <I>The Complete Psionics Handbook</I> discussed below may be confusing. If players are familiar with the previous
psionics rules, then a brief discussion of the changes to look for should be
noted.
<P></P>
Many of the terms and powers used in <I>The Complete Psionics Handbook</I> have been retained for this new system. However, the definitions and
descriptions may have changed, so read this section carefully. The most important
changes to watch for are the following:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>-</SPAN></FONT> <B><I>Attack and defense</I></B> modes are no longer powers, but bonus proficiencies. The new terms are
psionic attacks and psionic defenses. Psionicists gain psionic attacks and defenses
automatically by level advancement. Existing characters with attack modes must
select other telepathic devotions to replace them.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>-</SPAN></FONT> The <B><I>contact power</I></B> is now the contact bonus proficiency. The proficiency allows characters to
participate in psionic combat. In addition, psionic combat has been simplified to
work like other AD&amp;D combat forms (that is, using attack and damage rolls).
Characters who had the contact power must select another telepathic devotion to
replace it.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>-</SPAN></FONT> <A NAME="de548b3a"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="MS Sans Serif" SIZE="1"> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B><I>Tangents </I></B>have been eliminated.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>-</SPAN></FONT> <B><I>Maintenance costs</I></B> for powers have been eliminated. All powers now have a standard PSP cost per
round of use and can be maintained each round by paying that cost.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>-</SPAN></FONT> <B><I>Power scores</I></B> and the optional effects of rolls of power scores and 20s have been
eliminated. All characters now have <I>mental armor classes</I> (MAC) and <I>mental attack numbers</I> (MTHAC0). MTHAC0 stands for -mental THAC0? or -mental attack roll.- The
acronym refers to the number (or higher) a particular character needs to roll on
1d20 to hit an opponent with a mental armor class of 0. This mechanic has two
distinct uses that work in basically the same manner.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>-</SPAN></FONT> The <B><I>power check</I></B> has been eliminated. To determine the successful use of a psionic power, a
character makes an <I>MTHAC0 roll</I>. In psionic combat, a character makes MTHAC0 rolls to break through a
target's mental defenses and open the mind. To use a psionic power on an open mind, an
MTHAC0 roll is made against the power's MAC instead of the target's MAC. (All
psionic powers have base MAC scores.) Some minds are considered open
automatically (like the psionicist's own mind for the purposes of using a power on
himself). In these cases, no psionic combat is needed, for the mind is already open.

five disciplines.
