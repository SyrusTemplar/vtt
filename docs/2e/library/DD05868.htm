This covers a variety of more detailed or subtle relationships. An obvious
example is an opposition within the forces of law, which can be exploited by thief
PCs (or by a DM with lawful PCs too). For example, in one city the dominant
relationship between thieves and law officers is corruption. Senior officers, and
many of the watchmen, are corrupt, and readily take bribes. A small number of
decent but disillusioned juniors have tried to get firm evidence to nail their
superiors and try to eradicate the corruption, but they haven't been able to
manage this yet. Objective evidence hasn't been accumulated, and witnesses are
too scared to talk. There is concern that even some of the judges and magistrates
are in the pockets of criminal bosses or the Guildmaster of thieves. Cue for
lawful and/or good PCs to help out in a dangerous urban jungle of intrigue and
treachery...
<P></P>
Relationships may also be mixed. Thus, in one city ward, the commander of the
ward watch may be an iron-willed, ultra-lawful, dominating man who drills his
men to persecute thieves night and day. In another, richer ward at the far end
of the city, the inexperienced new junior leader is a follower of a kindly,
somewhat impractical faith, and does not think that crime deserves stern punishment
unless violence is involved. His men don't respect him, though, because of his
inexperience. Morale is falling, and an increasing number of watchmen leave
public service or else just don't care about enforcing the law any more. One
city, two radically different sets of possibilities for thieves. There may be major
tensions within a guild, as the thieves from the &quot;tough end&quot; of town start
trying their luck uptown!
<P></P>
Many possibilities exist in the Complex/Mix end of the spectrum. The other
themes can be mixed and varied to create many possibilities themselves. The only
limit is the DM's imagination.
