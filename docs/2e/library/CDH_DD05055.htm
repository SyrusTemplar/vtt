This druid lives in primitive Stone Age tribe, usually in a rain forest. Haro,
a typical Savage druid (pictured on the next page), differs from a savage
priest, shaman, or witch doctor in that he belongs to the worldwide druidic order
and, of course, to a druidic branch. Some Savage druids work and live among
primitive tribes as missionaries from more civilized cultures.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> Rather than associate with a particular tribe--as do most shamans or witch
doctors--the Savage druid adopts a neutral position, mediating intertribal feuds
and handling relations between human tribes and neighboring humanoids,
demihumans, or intelligent monsters. Most Savages live as hermits in the wild, although
if Haro gains high rank, he could control a coalition of tribespeople,
nonhumans, and animals.
<P></P>
If Haro joins a party in more civilized lands, he occupies the role of
outsider and observer. The Savage character should act puzzled by some aspects of more
advanced civilization, impressed, amused, or disgusted by others. The Savage
druid's reaction to big cities is unlikely to be favorable!
<P></P>
<B>Branch Restrictions:</B> None.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Savage druids are restricted to a choice of blowgun, club, dagger, harpoon,
knife, spear, or staff. After adventuring in civilized lands (advancing at least
one level doing so), they can learn other weapon proficiencies.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> Hunter.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonus</I>--fire-building, survival. <I>Recommended</I>--(general) direction sense, fishing, swimming, weather sense; (priest)
healing, herbalism, local history, musical instrument; (warrior) animal lore,
endurance, mountaineering, running, set snares, tracking.
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> The Savage druid can buy no armor (though he may acquire a wooden shield) and
can buy only those weapons listed above under &quot;Weapon Proficiencies.&quot; He
should spend his entire initial allotment of gold pieces on equipment, as he loses
any unspent starting money in excess of 1 gp.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> The Savage druid's body is covered with ceremonial scars and tattoos. These
eliminate the need to use the holy symbol of Haro's branch when casting
spells--his tattoos and other markings are as effective as holy symbols other druids
use.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> Haro, like most Savage druids, has an unusual and imposing appearance. While
he could alter his primitive dress easily, his strange accent, weathered
appearance, tattoos, and scars mark him as a foreigner when he travels in civilized
lands. These alien features give him a -2 reaction penalty among civilized NPCs;
players can decide how their PCs react.
<P></P>
<B>Wealth Options:</B> 3d6x5 gp. Savage druids begin adventuring unfamiliar with money; all their
starting wealth is actually an equivalent value in goods.
