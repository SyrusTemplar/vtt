<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Phobia—Crowds:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The character becomes panicked when surrounded by people, demihumans,
humanoids, etc. Shopping in marketplaces, dining at massive feasts, and celebrating at
festivals are all problems. The character must make a successful
Wisdom/Willpower check to enter such a setting. If a crowd gathers, the character must check
as soon as the DM judges that the PC is in the midst of a throng. If the
character fails the Willpower check, he will seek a private nook or cranny to get
out of sight, or try to leave the premises altogether. Even if he passes, the
success only lasts 2–12 turns—then the character must make another check.
