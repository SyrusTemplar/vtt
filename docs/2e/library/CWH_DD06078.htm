Since there is no meaningful difference between a mage and a specialist in
their abilities to cast the spells they know, wouldn't the wise player always
choose to play a mage? Not necessarily. In the long run, the specialist's
experience bonus, saving throw bonuses, and acquired powers (see the listings in the <A HREF="DD06079.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD06079.htm">school descriptions</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> below) make him a far more formidable opponent than the mage. Additionally,
the limits on the number of spells a wizard can use and know mean that the
specialist will eventually catch up to the mage in these areas.

One guideline for deciding between a mage and a specialist might be to
consider a mage if playing a short adventure. But for a lengthy campaign, a specialist
is probably the best bet; not only will he prove to be a more effective party
member, but a character with focused goals and aptitudes will be more
interesting to play
