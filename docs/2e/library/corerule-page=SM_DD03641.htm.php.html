<FONT SIZE="3">Naturally, this spell is an improvement of the
3rd-level alteration spell <I>blink</I>, allowing the wizard to shift
his body to any point within 15 feet of his current location. Unlike
the lower-level spell, <I>improved blink </I>allows the wizard to
choose the exact time of his jump, the exact destination, and the
orientation or facing of his choosing. For example, a wizard
confronted by an enemy fighter could blink just before the fighter
attacked, reappearing directly behind his foe for a back attack. If
the wizard blinks away from an attack, his enemy automatically
misses&#151;but creatures with multiple attacks may be able to
reposition themselves for another swing if the wizard blinks to a
location within reach.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">If the wizard intends to take any action such as
attacking, casting a spell, or using a magical item, he must decide
before the round begins if he will do so before or after he blinks.
If he acts before he blinks, he may be endangered by an attack before
he finishes; he can choose to proceed with his action, hoping that he
won&#146;t be hit, or he can abort his action by taking his blink for
the round. On the other hand, if the wizard begins his action after
his blink, the initiative modifier of his attack or spell is added to
the time of his blink to determine when he attacks.</FONT></P>

to blink first, when the fighter attacks and then </I>lightning bolt <I>the
offensive fellow. The fighter rolls a modified 6 for initiative, so
the wizard waits until 6, then </I>blinks<I>, making the fighter
miss. At that time, he starts his </I>lightning bolt<I>, which has a
casting time of 3&#151;the spell will go off on 9.</I></FONT></P>

the wizard must count 1, 2, or 3 phases from the time of his blink
for fast, average, or slow actions. If the fighter above attacked in
the average phase, the wizard would blink during the fighter&#146;s
attack, and then his </I>lightning bolt <I>(a fast spell) would go
off 1 phase later, with any other slow actions.</I></FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3">Because the wizard can pick the location he is
blinking to, he may not choose to blink into a movable object in
order to force it aside&#151;he must blink to an area clear of
obstructions or obstacles. If he does attempt to blink into a movable
object, he will find himself displaced to a random location (use the
