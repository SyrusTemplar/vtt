This is a doughty brand of halfling that, by his or her very nature,
represents a departure from the halfling norm. Often a young and unattached individual,
either male or female, the Homesteader is a halfling who sets out to found a
new farmstead in a region of wilderness or abandoned land. Another common
homesteading situation involves a young couple, recently married and previously living
in a very crowded burrow. Such small folk, if adventurous enough in spirit,
can find immediate rewards to homesteading.
<P></P>
Rarely will a Homesteader challenge an established authority over an area--if
humans or orcs have laid claim to a fertile valley, for example, the
Homesteader will probably look elsewhere for his or her plot.
<P></P>
Many halfling villages have grown around the individual plot of a brave
Homesteader--and indeed, unlike many human frontiersmen, the halfling Homesteader
welcomes the company of his or her fellows and will actively recruit other
halflings to live nearby.
<P></P>
The Homesteader is a hardy halfling, willing to work harder than the average
farmer and to accept a certain reduction in the comforts of his or her life--at
least, temporarily. His or her ideal, however, is to have a comfortable burrow
and cheerful batch of neighbors by the time he or she reaches old age.
<P></P>
The halfling Homesteader must have a Strength of at least 12 and an
Intelligence or Wisdom of at least 12.
<P></P>
Roads to Adventure: The Homesteader's most common route to adventure is in the
enacting of his or her goal: seeking out free land, clearing it, and defending
it against any who might care to take it away. However, once the farm is
established, the Homesteader is likely to embark on a long journey, visiting many
farflung halfling communities in the attempt to recruit other settlers to come
and join him or her. Indeed, this journey can involve several years of travel and
often forms the seeds of an epic tale that becomes the cornerstone of the
community's history--if the community survives, that is.
<P></P>
Also, the very trek involved in reaching the homestead can form a grand
adventure for the brave halflings who seek unsettled land. By nature curious, the
Homesteader might pass through a lot of different locales in the search for the
perfect steading. The adventures and obstacles of such an epic journey can easily
create the foundation of a great character history.
<P></P>
Role: Homesteaders are responsible for much of the expansion of the race
across the known worlds. Most halfling villages can trace their history back to a
hardy Homesteader couple, and these individuals tend to be revered by the
generations who have followed in their footsteps. This matriarch or patriarch will be
honored and feted in his or her old age and regarded as a prime source of
interesting stories. This is regarded as nothing less than a just reward for one who
took such risks and endured such hardships in order to bring another halfling
community into being.
<P></P>
Commonly, a halfling that sets out on a homesteading adventure will take at
least one stone from his or her family fireplace along on the journey. Then, when
he or she finally builds his or her own place, this stone will be used as a
key part of the new hearth.
<P></P>
Secondary Skills: Farming is the secondary skill most necessary to the
homesteader.
<P></P>
Weapon Proficiencies: The Homesteader should be proficient in either the short
bow or the sling and should also have a melee weapon proficiency with the
knife or short sword.
<P></P>
Bonus Nonweapon Proficiencies: Agriculture or Animal Handling is a bonus
proficiency to all characters who select the Homesteader kit. In addition, the
character can select either Hunting or Fishing as an additional bonus proficiency.
<P></P>
Recommended Nonweapon Proficiencies: This character has need of a wide variety
of skills; some of the more useful include Carpentry, Rope Use, Weather Sense,
and Survival. Others can be tied to the type of farming the Homesteader
intends to do: a shepherd can benefit from Weaving, a dairyman from Cheesemaking, any
herdsman has a use for Leatherworking, and a grain-grower can profit from a
knowledge of Baking or Brewing, for example.
<P></P>
Equipment: There is no specific item of equipment universal to halfling
Homesteaders. Many of them will have a handcart or small wagon, however, to carry
their belongings on the quest for the perfect plot of land. Additionally, a beast
of burden such as a pony or mule or animals that produce something useful (a
few ducks, chickens, or geese; a dairy cow or goat; a few sheep) can be worth
their weight in gold. Animals large and steady enough to pull the cart can prove
of double value when the homestead is finally reached.
<P></P>
Special Benefits: The Homesteader who carefully selects his or her land, works
hard at tending it, and then travels far and wide to recruit settlers is
likely to end up a very wealthy halfling, having earned the respect of the new
community and a place in the local histories. In effect, he or she exchanges a lot
of hard work and difficulties at a young age for the chance to be treated very
well when he or she grows old. Other intangible benefits can include such
grandiose attainments as having a town named after you, or the simple satisfaction of
seeing well-plowed fields and a thriving village where there was none before.
<P></P>
Special Hindrances: The primary hindrance to the hardy Homesteader is that he
or she has to do just about everything on his or her own--he or she does not
have a community of skilled neighbors to draw upon for help, barter, and advice.
