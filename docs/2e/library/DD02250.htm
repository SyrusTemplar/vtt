The<I> wall of fire</I> spell brings forth an immobile, blazing curtain of magical fire of shimmering
color--yellow-green or amber (different from the 4th-level wizard version).
The spell creates an opaque sheet of flame up to one 20-foot square per level of
the spellcaster, or a ring with a radius of up to 10 feet + 5 feet for every
two levels of experience of the wizard, and 20 feet high.
<P></P>
The wall of fire must be cast so that it is vertical with respect to the
caster. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of heat,
inflicting 2d4 points of damage upon creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of
damage upon those within 20 feet. In addition, the wall inflicts 4d4 points of
damage, plus 1 point of damage per level of the spellcaster, to any creature
passing through it. Creatures especially subject to fire may take additional
damage, and undead always take twice normal damage. Note that attempting to directly
catch moving creatures with a newly created wall of fire is difficult. A
successful saving throw enables the creature to avoid the wall, while its rate and
direction of movement determine which side of the created wall it is on. The wall
of fire lasts as long as the priest concentrates on maintaining it, or one
round per level of experience of the priest in the event he does not wish to
concentrate upon it.

The material component of the spell is phosphorus.
