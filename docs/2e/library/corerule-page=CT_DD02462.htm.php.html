<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Knockdowns
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Some creatures can smash their opponents to the ground with raw strength or
heavy weaponry. Knockdowns are based on the size of the attacker’s weapon
compared to the size of the defender.
<P></P>
Every weapon (including monster attacks) is assigned a <I>knockdown</I> die that is rolled when a hit is scored. Light weapons have a small die,
while heavy weapons use a d10 or d12 for knockdowns. The size of the target
determines what roll is required for a knockdown.

Don’t confuse the knockdown die with the actual damage caused by the hit; they
are two different things. It is a little quicker to roll the knockdown chance
along with the damage dice, but don’t feel like you have to.
<P></P>
Obviously, some creatures are immune to knockdowns. An ochre jelly, black
pudding, or fire elemental can’t really be knocked down, nor could a crocodile or
shark in the water. In addition, some monsters may be unusually resistant to
knockdown effects.

<B>Knockdown Effects.</B> Creatures who suffer a knockdown must roll a successful saving throw vs.
death or be knocked prone. The victim can stand up by forfeiting a half-move or an
attack. If he has already completed his actions for the round, he has to wait
until next round to stand up.

<P></P>
Any character or creature armed with a loaded and cocked crossbow or firearm
that is knocked down must roll a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation or
accidentally fire the weapon.

that weapon, and then modify the die for their own size. Increase the die one
step for each Size category larger than Man-sized, or decrease it for each one
under. For example, an ogre is wielding a morningstar, which normally has a
knockdown die of d10. Because the ogre is Size L, one size larger than Man-sized,
the knockdown die increases to a d12.
<P></P>
For monsters with natural attacks, choose a weapon that seems close to the
attack type and then modify it for the monster’s size. An adult dragon’s claws may
be like long swords. A wyvern’s sting might be similar to a spear. Monsters
may resist knockdowns better if they have four or more legs, are exceptionally
dense or low-built, or seem generally tougher than normal.
