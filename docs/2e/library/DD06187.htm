Defensive spells provide protection from specific or general types of attacks
in the following ways:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> By acting as a shield or barrier (<I>protection from normal missiles</I>)
<P></P>

<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> By sending away the opponent (<I>dismissal</I>)
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> By reducing the amount of damage suffered (<I>armor</I>)
<P></P>
<P></P>
The school of abjuration offers the greatest variety of Defensive spells, but
Defensive spells are also available in every other school. Some particularly
effective Defensive spells are offered in the schools of alteration (<I>gaze reflection</I> and <I>wraithform</I>), enchantment/charm (<I>sleep</I> and <I>hold person</I>), and illusion (<I>hypnotic pattern</I> and <I>mislead</I>).
<P></P>
Spells in the Defensive 1 category are typically cast on the wizard or on his
companions to provide direct protection from attacks; <I>globe of invulnerability, invisibility</I>, and <I>protection from evil</I> are examples of Defensive 1 spells. Spells in the Defensive 2 category are
typically cast on one or more opponents to hinder their ability to attack or
prevent them from attacking altogether; <I>fumble, ray of enfeeblement</I>, and<I> binding</I> are examples of Defensive 2 spells.
<P></P>
In general, Defensive 2 spells offer more protection than Defensive 1 spells,
since they effectively protect the entire party. For instance, a wizard
protecting himself with the Defensive 1 <I>globe of invulnerability</I> spell may be safe from an attacking opponent, but the opponent is free to
attack the wizard's companions. However, an opponent affected by the Defensive 2 <I>sleep</I> spell cannot attack anybody in the party.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Following are some general situations in which a wizard will find Defensive
spells particularly useful:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>The party has only a few members or has only low-level members.</I> The wizard's inability to use armor is his most vulnerable characteristic. A
wizard must either count on his companions for protection or provide it for
himself. In small parties, there probably are not enough members to provide
bodyguards for the wizard. A small party will also have their hands full in combat
situations, and probably will not have the time or the resources to look after a
wizard. Likewise, a party of low-level characters lacking high-quality armor or
other protective devices may have to depend on their wizard to provide
protection for them.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>The party has taken an excessive amount of damage.</I> A party that has lost a lot of hit points is not in a position to take
chances, especially if they anticipate trouble. A wizard armed with Defensive spells
can help the party through any tough times ahead.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>The party includes other player character wizards who lack Defensive spells.</I> If the party does not know what type of dangers it may face, a good idea is
to have as many different types of spells available as possible. It is helpful
if the wizard arms himself with a healthy supply of Defensive spells if his
fellow magic-using companions do not have them or choose not to use them.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>The wizard anticipates being alone.</I> If the wizard expects to be alone on guard duty or investigating a dangerous
locale by himself, operating as a spy, or otherwise functioning without the
company of others, he is safest with a supply of Defensive spells to compensate
for his lack of armor.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>The party anticipates encountering a specific type of enemy</I>. Many Defensive spells offer protection against a specific type of attack. If
the party believes it will be encountering a particular type of opponent, the
wizard should arm himself accordingly. (For instance, if the party anticipates
encountering an evil wizard, Defensive spells such as <I>dispel magic</I> and <I>Serten's spell immunity</I> would be wise choices.)
