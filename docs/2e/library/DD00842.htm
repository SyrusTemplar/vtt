<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Staff of Swarming Insects:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A staff of this sort is typically short and thick. When initially obtained or
encountered, much of its length is covered with finely done carvings depicting
winged biting and stinging insects (bees, deerflies, horseflies, wasps, and the
like). Any priest character (cleric, druid, shaman, witch doctor, etc.)
holding it can command the staff to create a swarm of such insects, at the same time
expending one of the staff's charges.
<P></P>
Range is 60 yards+10 yards per level of the user. The number of insects
produced is 60 plus 10 per level. Every 10 insects will inflict 1 point of damage
upon the target victim, regardless of Armor Class, unless the victim is protected
by a <I>force field,</I> engulfed in flames, etc. Note, however, that the insects will not affect
creatures larger than man-sized with a natural Armor Class of 5 or better.
<P></P>
When a vulnerable target is attacked by the swarm of flying insects, the
target will be unable to do anything other than attempt to dislodge and kill the
things. The insect attack lasts for one round. Each time the staff is employed,
one of the insect-shapes carved into its wooden surface will disappear, so it is
easy to determine how many charges are left in the staff. Unlike others of its
ilk, a staff of this sort can have as many as 50 initial charges. However, it
cannot be recharged.
