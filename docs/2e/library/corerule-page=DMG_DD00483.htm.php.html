Sometimes, no degree of luck, skill, ability, or resistance to various attacks
can prevent harm from coming to a character. The adventuring life carries with
it unavoidable risks. Sooner or later a character is going to be hurt.
<P></P>
To allow characters to be heroic, and for ease of play, damage is handled
abstractly in the AD&amp;D game. All characters and monsters have a number of hit
points. The more hit points a creature has, the harder it is to defeat.
<P></P>
Damage is subtracted from a character's or creature's hit points. Should one
of the player characters hit an ogre in the side of the head for 8 points of
damage, those 8 points are subtracted from the ogre's total hit points. The damage
isn't applied to the head or divided among different areas of the body.
<P></P>
Hit point loss is cumulative until a character dies or has a chance to heal
his wounds.

<I> Cwell the Fine, with 16 hit points, is injured by an orc that causes 3 hit
points of damage. Fifteen minutes later, Cwell runs into a bugbear that inflicts 7
points of damage, Cwell has suffered 10 points of damage. This 10 points of
damage remains until Cwell heals, either naturally or through magical means.
