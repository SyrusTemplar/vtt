</B>6. Plan Ahead</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Any successful AD&amp;D campaign requires a great deal of preparatory work on
the DM’s part. If you intend to play a high-level game, however, you also must
prepare your campaign for PCs who have the power to radically alter it, and you
have to be sure your campaign can provide a continuing challenge.
<P></P>
The best time to prepare for high-level play is during low-level play, when
the PCs are just learning about the world and you have had time to see how things
are working. If you wait too long, lots of details about your world become
fixed in the players’ minds, and you won’t have the flexibility you need to make
changes. If you start too soon, you may burn yourself out before you ever run an
adventure (all work and no play makes the DM dull), and you run the risk of
over-planning and trying to force the campaign’s action in directions the players
don’t want to go. In other words, get your campaign going at low-level, see
what you’re players are going to do with it, and then start laying the groundwork
for high-level play.
