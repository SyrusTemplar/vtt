The ground’s movement characteristics can have a drastic effect on the course
of a battle. This is referred to as footing. Footing is briefly described in <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02452.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02452.htm.php.html">Chapter One</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">; the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02534.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02534.htm.php.html">terrain descriptions</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> that follow this section go into more detail on the footing for each type of
battlefield.

The principal effect of poor footing is to limit movement to a fraction of
normal. A character with a normal movement rate of 9 who is in heavy brush is
limited to a MV of 3. The character’s full-move and half-move combat actions are
all affected by this limitation.
