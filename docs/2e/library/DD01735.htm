<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Evil priests are normally considered to be in league with undead creatures, or
at least to share their aims and goals. Thus, they have no ability to turn
undead. However, they can attempt to command these beings.
<P></P>
This is resolved in the same way as a turning attempt. Up to 12 undead can be
commanded. A -T? result means the undead automatically obey the evil priest,
while a -D? means the undead become completely subservient to the evil priest.
They follow his commands (to the best of their ability and understanding) until
turned, commanded, or destroyed by another.
<P></P>
Evil priests also have the ability to affect paladins, turning them as if they
were undead. However, since the living spirit of a paladin is far more
difficult to quell and subvert, paladins are vastly more difficult to turn.
<P></P>
An evil priest attempting to turn a paladin does so as if the priest were
three levels lower than he actually is. Thus, a 7th-level evil priest would turn
paladins on the 4th-level column. He would have only a slim chance of turning a
7th-level paladin (7 HD) and would not be able to turn one of 8th level at all
(using the level of the paladin as the HD to be turned). All -D? results against
paladins are treated as -T? results.
