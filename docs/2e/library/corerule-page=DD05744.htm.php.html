   The total number of rangers is difficult to determine. Because of their
independent nature and tendency to avoid civilized society, rangers aren't likely to
cooperate with a formal census. Additionally, many rangers reside in the most
remote regions of the world, making a population count impractical if not
impossible.
<P></P>
   Still, it's safe to say that rangers are among the less numerous of the
character classes, if for no other reason than the demanding ability score
requirements limit their number. It's a good bet that there are fewer rangers than bards.
They're perhaps more common than paladins. Beyond these generalities, it's
anybody's guess.
<P></P>
   Terrain preferences are a little easier to ascertain. Most rangers prefer
forests, hills, and plains, thanks to the flourishing animal life and comfortable
climates. Rugged mountains, and jungles attract the more adventurous rangers,
while only the hardiest rangers make their home in the harsh lands of the desert
and arctic. As a rough guideline, assume that about 40% of all rangers have
Forest as their primary terrain, about 15% have Hill, another 10% or so each have
Jungle, Mountain, or Plain, and the rest are more or less equally divided among
Swamp, Desert, Arctic, and Aquatic.

   Unless the demi-rangers described in Chapter 4 are allowed in your campaign,
rangers must be human, elf, or half-elf. Roughly 70% of all rangers are human,
10% are elves, and 20% are half-elves. Even in demi-ranger campaigns, less than
1% of the ranger population are dwarves, gnomes, or halflings.

   Gender plays no part in determining one's aptitude for becoming a ranger.
About half the ranger population is male, and the other half, female, reflecting
the percentages in the general population.

<P></P>
   No particular social background predominates in the ranger population. Lower,
middle, and upper class rangers are more or less equally represented, with a
slight bias toward the lower classes at low levels because these are closest to
the land.
<P></P>
   Certain kits also tend to favor certain social classes. Feralans and Greenwood
Rangers tend to come from lower economic backgrounds, while Falconers, Sea
Rangers, and Wardens often come from wealthier families. Social class, however, is
only one element that influences a ranger's personality. A Guardian with a
lower class background who has worked his way up might behave little differently
than one with middle class origins.

   More relevant to the ranger's choice of career is the size of his family and
his role within it. Because his duties place him into a life of relative
isolation, the best candidates for rangers are those with few family ties. Orphans and
late children are disproportionately represented in the ranger population, as
are those who have been disowned or cast out by their families.

   There are no rigid age requirements for rangers. However, few adolescents are
capable of commanding the respect due a ranger, while many older individuals
have trouble managing the rigors of the wild. Consequently, the majority of
rangers fall between the ages of 18-60.

<P></P>
   All rangers are of good alignment, and the number of lawful good, neutral
good, and chaotic good rangers are approximately equal. The more independent and
isolated a ranger, the less likely he'll be lawful good. Lawful good rangers are
often drawn to the Guardian, Justifier, and Warden kits. The Pathfinder and
Explorer kits tend to have more than their share of neutral good rangers. Chaotic
good rangers are generally associated with the Feralan and Mountain Man kits.
