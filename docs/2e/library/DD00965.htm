<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Helm of Opposite Alignment:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This metal hat looks like a typical helmet. If magic is detected for, it
radiates magic of an indeterminate sort. Once placed upon the head, however, its
curse immediately takes effect, and the alignment of the wearer is radically
alteredâ€”good to evil, neutral to some absolute commitment (LE, LG, CE, CG) as
radically different from the former alignment as possible. Alteration in alignment is
mental and, once effected, is desired by the individual changed by the magic.
<P></P>
Only a <I>wish</I> can restore former alignment, and the affected individual will not make any
attempt to return to the former alignment. If a paladin is concerned, he must
undergo a special quest and <I>atone</I> if the curse is to be obliterated. Note that once a <I>helm of opposite alignment</I> has functioned, it loses all of its magical properties.
