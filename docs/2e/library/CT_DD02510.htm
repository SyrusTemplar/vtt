</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">In a duel, initiative works differently than it does in a normal melee. Roll
initiative normally at the beginning of the fight, but disregard any critical
events-this is a contest of skill, not luck. The character that wins initiative
is called the attacker, and his opponent becomes the defender.
<P></P>
After the first round, duels don-t have initiative rolls. Instead, the
attacker retains the initiative until one of the following events occurs:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> He chooses a combat action that does not require an attack roll in a round;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> The defender disarms or traps the attacker's primary weapon;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> The attacker is knocked down or forced to retreat by the defender;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> The defender overbears, trips, or otherwise grapples the attacker.
<P></P>
<P></P>
When the initiative shifts, the effects are immediate-if an attacker loses the
initiative in the fast phase, his opponent is considered to have the iniative
in the average, slow, and very slow phases of that same round, as well as the
following round (or at least until the new attacker loses the initiative.)
