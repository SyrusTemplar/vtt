<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Helm of Underwater Action:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When this helm is viewed, it is indistinguishable from a normal helmet.
However, detection reveals it to be magical, and the possessor is able to see and
breathe underwater. Visual properties of the helm are activated when small lenses
are drawn across the device from compartments on either side. These allow the
wearer to see five times farther than water and light conditions allow for
normal human vision. (Note that weeds, obstructions, and the like block vision in
the usual manner.) If the command word is spoken, the <I>helm of underwater action</I> creates a globe of air around the wearer's head, and maintains it until the
command word is spoken again. Thus, the wearer can breathe freely.
