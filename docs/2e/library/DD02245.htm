To cast this spell, the priest must be in sight of a rainbow, or have a
special component (see below). The<I> rainbow</I> spell has two applications, and the priest can choose the desired one at the
time of casting. These applications are as follows:
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Bow:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The spell creates a shimmering, multi-layered short composite bow of rainbow
hues. It is light and easy to pull, so that any character can use it without
penalty for non-proficiency. It is magical: Each of its shimmering missiles is the
equivalent of a +2 weapon, including attack and damage bonuses. Magic
resistance can negate the effect of any missile fired from the bow. The bow fires seven
missiles before disappearing. It can be fired up to four times per round. Each
time a missile is fired, one hue leaves the bow, corresponding to the color of
arrow that is released. Each color of arrow has the ability to cause double
damage to certain creatures, as follows:
<P></P>
<P></P>
Red--fire dwellers/users and fire elementals
<P></P>
Orange--creatures or constructs of clay, sand, earth, stone or similar
materials, and earth elementals
<P></P>
Yellow--vegetable opponents (including fungus creatures, shambling mounds,
treants, etc.)
<P></P>
Green--aquatic creatures, electricity-using creatures, and air elementals
<P></P>
Indigo--acid-using or poison-using creatures
<P></P>
Violet--metallic or regenerating creatures
<P></P>
<P></P>
When the bow is drawn, an arrow of the appropriate color magically appears,
nocked and ready. If no color is requested, or a color that has already been used
is asked for, then the next arrow (in the order of the spectrum) appears.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Bridge:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The caster causes the rainbow to form a seven-hued bridge up to 3 feet wide
per level of the caster. It must be at least 20 feet long and can be as long as
120 yards, according to the caster's desire. It lasts as long as the spell's
duration or until ordered out of existence by the caster.
<P></P>
The components for this spell are the priest's holy symbol and a vial of holy
water. If no rainbow is in the vicinity, the caster can substitute a diamond of
not less than 1,000 gp value, specially prepared with<I> bless</I> and<I> prayer</I> spells while in sight of a rainbow. The holy water and diamond disappear when
the spell is cast.
