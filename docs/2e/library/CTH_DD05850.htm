A strong thieves' guild may regulate the activities of forgers and &quot;clippers&quot;,
to keep the proportion of forgeries and clippings within reasonable limits. If
there are too many forgeries floating around, the value of coin will sharply
deteriorate, to no one's benefit (including the thieves). Clipping is simply the
art of shaving fine slivers from the edges of coins and using the salvaged
metal for subsequent coin-forging or for other purposes. A shaved-off margin of
some 5% from the original is usually fairly undetectable, but coins may be
clipped several times during their lifetime! In advanced societies in the campaign
world, the dies used to make coins may have milled or marked edges to prevent
clipping.
