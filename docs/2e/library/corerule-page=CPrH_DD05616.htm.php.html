<P></P>
This priest is a smooth talker and an advocate of all the goals of his
priesthood and all the virtuous behaviors there are. But, deep down, he doesn't
believe in them. He's fooled his superiors in the priestly order, he's probably
fooled his adventuring companions, he's certainly fooled his flock . . . but he
himself knows the truth.
<P></P>
This is a pretty villainous personality type; when a hypocrite priest isn't a
villain, he's merely weak-willed. Either way, such characters are rare among
player-character heroes. And they never get away with it forever.
<P></P>
Here are some examples of this character's typical behavior:
<P></P>
He generously gifts coins to city beggars and earns their praise. But on the
side, out of sight, he trafficks in stolen goods, perhaps including objects
stolen from temples of his order, and uses the respect accorded to priests to
smuggle his stolen goods through city gates and inspection lines.
<P></P>
When a beautiful young member of the flock comes tearfully to him with
problems, he arranges to see her privately to counsel her. Alone with the troubled
young lady, he will seduce her, then abandon her, blackmailing her with the
besmirching of her reputation to keep his own reputation clean. And should she, in
her grief, decide to commit suicide, he'll be the most anguished of mourners at
her funeral (perhaps he will officiate) . . . and then begin to work on the
young lady's better-looking friends the same way.
<P></P>
When sinners come to him after doing evil, they'll always find absolution . .
. for a hefty price in gold pieces. Such sinners are almost always repeat
offenders, and so they are also repeat spenders.
<P></P>
Obviously, this sort of personality is best-suited to non-player characters.
But it is always an option for, and can be a challenge to, player-characters as
well.
<P></P>
The Hypocrite is limited to lawful neutral, lawful evil, true neutral, and
neutral evil character alignments.
<P></P>
In combat situations, the Hypocrite will tend to behave like the priest he's
supposed to be. If he can find reason to get out of the way of combat, he will:
For instance, if an ally is injured, the Hypocrite will drop behind the lines
to heal or doctor him. The Hypocrite is also prone to directing the actions of
his teammates in such a way that they take all the risks. If one of them is
killed or injured, of course, he will appear to agonize over it.
<P></P>
In role-playing situations, the Hypocrite will be the smoothest and most
concerned character around. However, his player will need to communicate, in private
consultation with the DM or through secret notes, the Hypocrite's true motives
and plans.
<P></P>
Eventually the other characters will catch on, and ultimately they will expose
or even kill him. It's up to the player then to decide what the Hypocrite will
do (assuming he survives): He could change his name and start over again
elsewhere, or pretend to reform and become a little more sophisticated in his
tactics, or he could even reform and change personality types.
