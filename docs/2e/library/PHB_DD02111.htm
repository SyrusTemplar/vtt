When this spell is cast, all magic and magical items within the radius of the
spell, except those on the person of or being touched by the spellcaster, are
disjoined. That is, spells being cast are separated into their individual
components (usually spoiling the effect as a <I>dispel magic</I> spell does), and permanent and enchanted magical items must successfully save
(vs. spell if actually cast on a creature, or vs. a <I>dispel magic</I> spell otherwise) or be turned into normal items. Even artifacts and relics
are subject to Mordenkainen's disjunction, though there is only a 1% chance per
caster experience level of actually affecting such powerful items. Thus, all
potions, scrolls, rings, rods, miscellaneous magical items, artifacts and relics,
arms and armor, swords, and miscellaneous weapons within 30 feet of the
spellcaster can possibly lose all their magical properties when the <I>Mordenkainen's disjunction</I> spell is cast. The caster also has a 1% chance per level of destroying an
antimagic shell. If the shell survives the disjunction, no items within it are
disjoined.
<P></P>
Note: Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and 95% likely to attract
the attention of some powerful being who has an interest or connection with the
device. Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, the casting wizard must
roll a successful saving throw vs. spell with a -4 penalty or permanently lose all
spellcasting abilities.
