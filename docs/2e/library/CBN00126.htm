This spell establishes a sensual link between the priest and an skeleton or a
zombie within the spell’s range. This link allows the caster to see what the
undead sees as if the priest were looking through the creature’s eyes. The link
also enables the priest to hear any sounds that occur in the vicinity of the
undead being. The priest can hear and see exactly as if he or she were standing at
the same location as the undead creature. The spell also allows the priest to
issue simple commands via this link. The spell ends abruptly if either the
caster or the undead creature moves out of range or is somehow moved to another
plane.

Alternatively, the spell may be cast upon an (inanimate) corpse. In such a
case, the spell transmits visual and auditory senses to the priest, but does not
confer any ability to command or animate the body. The material components are
the priest’s unholy symbol and a black, hooded cowl which must be worn over the
eyes and ears of the priest to benefit from the <I>spectral senses</I>.
