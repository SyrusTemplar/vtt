One of the most overlooked assets of the wizard or priest is the ability to
research new spells. In the hands of a clever player, this ability results in
powerful and unique player characters. Since the player has to get involved to
make the research rules work, it is also an excellent method for getting player
ideas into the campaign. However, since there are so many different possibilities
in spell research, there are few set rules. Use the following as guidelines
when faced with magical research in the campaign.
