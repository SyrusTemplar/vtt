<P></P>
Virtually all creatures can make one overbearing attack each round. As
explained in <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02485.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02485.htm.php.html">Chapter Two</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, overbearing requires an attack roll vs. Armor Class 10. Adjustments for
Dexterity and magic apply to the defender’s Armor Class.
<P></P>
If the attack hits, there is an opposed Strength roll to determine if the
defender keeps her feet. A list of modifiers (expanded from <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02485.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02485.htm.php.html">Chapter Two</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">) is included below:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> 4-point bonus or penalty per size difference of the largest attacker versus
the defender;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> +1 bonus per additional attacker;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> –4 penalty if defender has more than two legs;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> –4 penalty if the defender is legless (snake, worm, slug);
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> –4 penalty if the defender is generally amorphous (ooze, slime, jelly).*
<P></P>
<P></P>
*Creatures that qualify for this modifier also get the modifier for having no
legs, for a total penalty of –8.
<P></P>
<P></P>
If the defender wins the opposed Strength roll, she stays on her feet and the
attackers remain in their squares. The defender remains clear and can finish
the round normally. If the attackers win, they (or as many as will fit) enter the
defender’s square and everyone falls in a heap with the attackers on top. The
overborne character takes no damage. Note that attackers in squares adjacent to
the defender can contribute to overbearing attacks even if they can’t enter
the defender’s square.
<P></P>
If defender is overborne, she loses all actions for the remainder of the round
and her actions are severely limited the next round; the character is grappled
and cannot move or make any attacks (including attacks of opportunity) until
she gets free.
<P></P>
A defender who has been knocked down by an overbearing attack can be pinned if
she is successfully overborne again in the following round. Overborne
defenders can do nothing until the pin is resolved.
