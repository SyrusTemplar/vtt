This spell enables a priest to conjure up a weak air elemental--a dust devil
of AC 4, 2 HD, MV 180 feet per round, one attack for 1d4 points of damage--which
can be hit by normal weapons. The dust devil appears as a small whirlwind 1
foot in diameter at its base, 5 feet tall, and 3 to 4 feet across at the top. It
moves as directed by the priest, but dissipates if it is ever separated from
the caster by more than 30 yards. Its winds are sufficient to put out torches,
small campfires, exposed lanterns, and other small, open flames of nonmagical
origin. The dust devil can hold a gas cloud or a creature in gaseous form at bay
or push it away from the caster (though it cannot damage or disperse such a
cloud). If skimming along the ground in an area of loose dust, sand, or ash, the
dust devil picks up those particles and disperses them in a 10-foot-diameter
cloud centered on itself. The cloud obscures normal vision, and creatures caught
within are blinded while inside and for one round after they emerge. A
spellcaster caught in the dust devil or its cloud while casting must make a saving throw
vs. spell to keep his concentration, or the spell is ruined. Any creature
native to the Elemental Plane of Air--even another dust devil--can disperse a dust
devil with a single hit.
