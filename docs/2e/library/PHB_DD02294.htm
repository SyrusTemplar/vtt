This spell enables the priest (and possibly one or two other persons) to alter
the substance of his body to a cloudlike vapor. A magical wind then wafts the
priest along at a movement rate of 60, or as slow as 6, as the spellcaster
wills. The<I> wind walk</I> spell lasts as long as the priest desires, up to a maximum duration of six
turns (one hour) per experience level of the caster. For every eight levels of
experience the priest has attained, up to 24, he is able to touch another person
and carry that person, or those persons, along on the wind walk. Persons wind
walking are not invisible, but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully
clothed in white, they are 80% likely to be
<P></P>
mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, etc. The priest can regain his physical form
as
<P></P>
desired, each change to and from vaporous form requiring five rounds. While in
vaporous form, the priest and companions are hit only by magic or magical
weaponry, though they may be subject to high winds at the DM's discretion. No
spellcasting is possible in vaporous form.
<P></P>
The material components of this spell are fire and holy water.
