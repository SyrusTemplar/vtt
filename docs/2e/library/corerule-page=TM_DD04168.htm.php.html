<P></P>
Duration: 1 round/level
<P></P>
Casting Time: 1
<P></P>
Area of Effect: The caster
<P></P>
Saving Throw: None Upon casting this spell, a feathery membrane grows under
the
<P></P>
wizard's arms, extending along his sides all the way to his feet. The membrane
appears
<P></P>
to merge with the caster's skin and clothing.
<P></P>
<P></P>
If the caster spreads his arms and jumps from a height, he may glide through
the air. For each foot of elevation, the wizard can glide five feet
horizontally. Thus, a wizard jumping from a 10-foot wall could glide up to 50 feet. Gliding
characters have a movement rate of 12 and Maneuverability Class E. A wizard
attempting to carry more than his normal weight allowance plummets to the earth
upon takeoff.
<P></P>
When the spell expires, the feathers instantly disappear. If the wizard is
airborne, he immediately plummets toward the ground.
<P></P>
The material component is an eagle's feather.
