The swamp druid's role centers around guarding marshes, fens, bogs, wetlands,
and swamps, as well as the abundant plant and animal life within them. Willoo,
an average swamp druid (pictured next page), resembles a normal forest druid,
but his particular habitat makes him less socially acceptable. He opposes anyone
who would drain his swamp in the name of &quot;progress,&quot; even if such land were
needed for farming or urban construction. Swamp druids often live as hermits; the
more sociable among them sometimes serve as priests for outlaws hiding in the
swamps or for lizard men who lack their own shamans.

<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Has an immunity to insect-transmitted diseases common to swamps, such as
malaria, and a +2 bonus on saving throws vs. any other diseases.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Receives a +1 reaction adjustment from normal animals that live in swamps
(such as crocodiles) and from monsters whose habitat is a swamp or marsh for
instance, black dragons, bullywugs, and lizard men.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Learns the languages of intelligent humanoids and monsters that inhabit the
swamp (black dragons, bullywugs, lizard men, shambling mounds, will o' wisps,
etc.), gaining one extra proficiency slot for this purpose every three levels (at
3rd, 6th, etc.). (Note that to &quot;speak&quot; with a will o' wisp, a swamp druid needs
a light source, such as a hooded lantern, to signal with.)
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Identifies plants, animals, and pure water with perfect accuracy at 3rd level.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Passes through overgrown areas and mud at the full movement rate without
leaving a trail at 3rd level. The swamp druid can use this power to cross quicksand
without sinking.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Uses the <I>animal friendship</I> spell (which usually affects only normal or giant animals) at 5th level to
influence semi-intelligent swamp-dwelling monsters or those of animal
Intelligence. The effects on such monsters, including catoblepas, hydra, lernaean hydra,
and pyrohydra, remain those of <I>animal friendship</I>. The druid has to want to befriend the monster, not use it as sword-fodder.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Shapechanges into a normal reptile, bird, or mammal up to three times per day
at 7th level. The druid can assume only the form of real-world creatures that
live in swamps or wetlands (crocodile, frog, marsh bird, snake, etc.). The druid
can adopt each animal form (reptile, bird, or mammal) once per day.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Casts an <I>insect plague</I> (as the spell) once per day at 7th level. This power works only when the
druid is within the boundaries of a swamp or marsh.
<P></P>
<B>Special Limitation:</B> Willoo's clothes, like those of most swamp druids, frequently look caked with
mud and often drip with swamp water. He always has a faint odor of the swamp
about him. His lack of cleanliness gives him a -1 penalty to reaction adjustment
from most people and a -3 penalty regarding upper-class individuals, such as
gentry or nobles.
<P></P>
<B>Holy Symbol and Grove:</B> The grove usually lies deep within a marsh or swamp--a stand of beautiful
mangroves, weeping willows, swamp oak, or the like. Many groves are actually
islands, sometimes guarded by natural traps such as quicksand. A swamp druid uses as
a holy symbol a vial of water from a sacred swamp grove.
