<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Fighting inside buildings or in the streets of a town is almost as risky as
fighting inside a dungeon. Ambush lurks around every corner, and at times it may
be hard to distinguish between enemies and bystanders. Many town fights involve
thieves or cutthroats who know their turf far better than the PCs, who are
often visitors.
<P></P>
The biggest consideration in a fight in a civilized area is the possibility of
help or interference from the local watch or nosy bystanders. Unless the PCs
are willing to accept a price on their heads, they?ll want to cooperate with the
local constabulary. The DM should make a point of preparing for the arrival of
the watch, since it?s likely that someone will call for help before too long.
