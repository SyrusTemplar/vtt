<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hunting:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">When in wilderness settings, the character can attempt to stalk and bring down
game. A proficiency check must be made with a -1 penalty to the ability score
for every nonproficient hunter in the party. If the die roll is successful, the
hunter (and those with him) have come within 101 to 200 yards (100+1d100) of
an animal. The group can attempt to close the range, but a proficiency check
must be made for each 20 yards closed. If the stalking is successful, the hunter
automatically surprises the game. The type of animal stalked depends on the
nature of the terrain and the whim of the DM.
