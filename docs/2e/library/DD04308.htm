A thief entering an area enchanted with <I>thief's lament</I> suffers a great reduction in his thieving skills. The thief is allowed a
saving throw to resist the effects of the spell; failure indicates that he suffers
the full effects of the lament. All attempts to pick pockets, open locks,
find/remove traps, move silently, detect noise, climb walls, and hide in shadows are
reduced by 25% (although a skill cannot be reduced below 5%, presuming the
character has at least a score of 5% in any skill).
<P></P>
The spell affects a cube whose sides equal the caster's level times five feet
(a 10th-level caster could affect a cube whose sides equal 50 feet).
<P></P>
The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a silver key.
