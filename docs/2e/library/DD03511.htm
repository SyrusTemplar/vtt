wizard may choose to memorize a <I>cantrip </I>as a 1st-level spell-just as it's described in the <A HREF="PHB_DD01813.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01813.htm">PHB</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> -or he can memorize individual applications of <I>cantrip </I>for a cost of 1 spell point each. These one-shot cantrips have the exact same
effect as the 1st-level spell, but each application consumes 1 SP and has a
duration of one full turn.

All <I>cantrips</I> are free magicks by definition; the wizard can perform any minor magical feat
appropriate for the spell, without selecting the precise incantation ahead of
time. A wizard is limited in the number of <I>cantrips </I>he can memorize at one time; he can-t allocate more than twice his number of
spells allowed for each level to <I>cantrips</I>. For example, a 1st-level mage is limited to no more than two spells of each
level, so he can memorize a maximum of four <I>cantrips</I>. A 6th-level mage is limited to four spells of any given level, so he can
memorize up to eight <I>cantrips</I>.

generally useless in combat. Of course, clever and resourceful players can
create plenty of mayhem, even with magic as weak as this.
