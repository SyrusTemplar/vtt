This is a ceremony where the participants try to commune with the god, to
invoke a little of his spirit, to briefly become more like the god.
<P></P>
Here, too, each god will have a very different ceremony. Communion with the
god of Competition will take the form of athletic games. Communion with the god
of Prosperity will be a great, enormous feast. Communion with the god of
Kingship will be a private little coronation where each household leader is
acknowledged as the head of the household. Communion with the god of Peace will be a
quiet meditation. Communion with the god of Love or Fertility is left as an
exercise for your imagination.
