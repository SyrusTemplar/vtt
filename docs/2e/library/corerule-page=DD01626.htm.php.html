</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Not every piece of equipment is described here. The vast majority of things
found on the equipment lists need no description, as their functions, forms, and
purposes are obvious. Only those items whose use is obscure or appearance is
unusual are described below. Specific game effects of equipment are given in the
appropriate sections of the rules.
