to some of the most useful spells in the game. Conjurations are some of the most
physically demanding spells, and a wizard must have a Constitution (or
Constitution/Health) score of at least 15 in order to be a conjurer.
Conjuration/summoning is opposed by divination and invocation/evocation.
<P></P>
All the normal benefits and hindrances of specialist wizards apply to
conjurers. In addition, at 11th level a conjurer gains the ability to cast conjuration
and summoning spells without any material components. At 14th level, the
conjurer gains the power to instantly dispel creatures conjured by an opponent who
has used <I>monster summoning </I>or an equivalent spell. The conjurer can dispel up to 10 HD worth of creatures
with this ability simply by pointing at the target and concentrating one
round. Only creatures with 5 HD or less are affected, so a conjurer could dispel
three 3 HD creatures, two 5 HD creatures, or any combination that does not exceed
10 HD. The conjurer may use this ability up to three times per day.
<P></P>
The conjurer?s spells can be very potent in combat, especially if used to
multiply the party?s numbers through the summoning of allies.
