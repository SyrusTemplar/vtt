<B>Limited Wish</B>
<P></P>
As with <I>wish</I> (see the discussion <A HREF="DD06218.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD06218.htm">below</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">), the DM should decide the limitations of <I>limited wish</I> before his wizards have an opportunity to use it, preferably before the
campaign begins. Here are some suggestions for what a limited wish can accomplish.
The DM is free to alter these suggestions as he sees fit.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> A <I>limited wish</I> can heal damage for the caster or any single character of the caster's
choice. A good range is 20-35 hit points (5d4 + 15) of healing. If a <I>limited wish</I> is used to heal damage in this way, it cannot be used to restore life; that
is, it cannot affect any creature who has been reduced to 0 hit points.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> A <I>limited wish</I> can temporarily restore life to any creature or person who was reduced to 0
hit points or less within the previous 24 hours. The <I>limited wish</I> restores the subject to exactly 1 hit point. Success is not automatic; the
subject is required to make a resurrection survival check. However, the effect
lasts for only a limited time (1-4 hours is a good range). At the end of this
time, the creature reverts to the number of hit points he had before the <I>limited wish</I> was cast (0 hit points or less).
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> A<I> limited wish</I> can inflict damage on any single character. A good range is 20-40 (5d4 + 15)
hit points of damage. The victim can save vs. spell for half damage.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> A<I> limited wish</I> can duplicate the effects of any spell of 7th-level of less.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> A<I> limited wish</I> can change the outcome of any action the wizard took within the past 24
hours, as long as the change is reasonably minor. For instance, the wizard could
wish to search the body of an opponent he defeated earlier that day, but he could
not wish to single-handedly have fought and defeated an entire army. All of the
general restrictions that apply to wish (see below) also apply to <I>limited wish</I>. The suggestions regarding the selection of appropriate durations, casting
times, and areas of effect also apply.
