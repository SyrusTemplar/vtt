</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> You don't necessarily have to Parry the very first attack made against you . .
. though that is the simplest way to do things. If you prefer, you can choose
which attacker you're going to Parry.
<P></P>
<I>Example: Amstard is fighting an ogre and its idiotic goblin jester. Before
initiative is rolled, he announces that he'll be using one of his two attacks to
Parry.
<P></P>
The NPCs win initiative and attack. The jester attacks first. Amstard
announces that he's not Parrying this attack. The jester hits him, doing minuscule
damage. Then the ogre attacks. Amstard announces that he is Parrying this attack.
The ogre rolls an attack, and succeeds; Amstard rolls to attack, and succeeds in
Parrying the attack.
<P></P>
Then, it's the player-characters' turn. Amstard still has an attack left, and
so swings at the ogre.
<P></P>
</I> If a character Holds his Parry, anticipating that some other attacker will
swing at him, but that attack never materializes (for example, because that
specific opponent went somewhere else), and he's still suffering attacks this round,
he can use that Parry against one of these other attacks. He may not, however,
apply it against an attack that has already taken place.
