</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This is the best way for an unskilled climber to get up a wall. Carrying a
ladder requires two Man-sized creatures per 10 feet of length. The carriers move
as though heavily encumbered. A ladder can be put in position against a wall in
the End-of-Round step of any round when it is carried to the base of the wall.
A ladder must be at least as long as the wall is tall, plus five feet. A
character can climb four feet of ladder per movement point each round.
<P></P>
Defenders atop a wall can use an attack to push a ladder away. If the ladder
is not braced or loaded with climbers, the attempt always succeeds. Otherwise,
the ladder falls if the defender makes a successful open doors roll. Trying to
push a ladder away provokes attacks of opportunity if the defender is threatened.
<P></P>
When a climber reaches the top of a wall, he can step onto the wall during the
round's resolution phase if there is an empty square in front of him (this
could provoke an attack of opportunity). If there is no empty square, the climber
must slay a defender or force a retreat and create an empty square before
stepping from the ladder.
