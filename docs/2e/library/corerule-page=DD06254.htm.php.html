<P></P>
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> If your wizard is interested in researching new magical items and is looking
for an unusual project, he might consider one of the choices listed below. All
of these items have been proposed by wizards over the years, but none has yet
been successfully researched. The DM and the player must establish the exact
effects for these items as well as the details of the research. Keep in mind that
if the research was easy, some other wizard would surely have completed it by now

<P></P>
<P></P>
This is a bridge that can be folded up and carried in a pocket. When unfolded,

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
This is a mechanical heart capable of replacing a damaged or aging human
heart. No surgery is required; the mechanical heart is merely placed on the
recipient's chest and it is absorbed into his body. Presumably, the mechanical heart
would increase the owner's endurance and resistance to disease

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>7. Cold Fire</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
This type of fire looks the same as normal fire, but it generates no heat.
Cold fire would be useful for torches in cramped quarters, and also would be a
safe light source for homes, since there would be no danger of accidental fires.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>8. Dark Fire</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
The antithesis of cold fire, dark fire generates heat the same as normal fire,
but it produces no light. With flames as black as shadows, dark fire would be
useful in making campfires for soldiers or other travelers who did not wish
their location to be revealed by bright flames
