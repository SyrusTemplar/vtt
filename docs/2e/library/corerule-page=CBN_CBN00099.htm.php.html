This ward may be placed on any non-living skull or the skull of an undead
skeleton. The <I>skulltrap</I> remains dormant until the skull is touched by living matter or is struck and
damaged by non-living matter (for instance, it’s struck by in combat or falls
to the floor). Assume a normal skull is AC 8 and has 2 hp. This simple warding
does not discriminate; it can just as easily be triggered by the wizard who cast
the spell as by a curious rat brushing up against it.
<P></P>
When the <I>skulltrap </I>discharges, the skull flashes briefly with red or violet light and violently
explodes, releasing a blast of energy drawn from the Negative Material plane.
The burst of negative energy does 2d4 hp damage plus 1d4 hp damage for every
level of the caster. All living creatures within 10’ of the skull must make a
saving throw vs. breath weapon to suffer only half damage from the blast.
<P></P>
Because the trap is so easily triggered, the skull is often placed in its
final resting place before casting the spell on it. The trapped skull may be moved
without triggering the trap, but it must be moved very slowly and without
contact with living matter. Gloves or any other thin materials used to cover the
flesh of a living being are not enough to prevent the skulltrap from being
discharged. The material component is a pinch of dust from the physical remains of a
corporeal undead being with strong ties to the Negative Material Plane, such as
a wight or vampire.
