When this spell is cast by the wizard, he influences the actions of the chosen
recipient by the utterance of a few words--phrases or a sentence or
two--suggesting a course of action desirable to the spellcaster. The creature to be
influenced must, of course, be able to understand the wizard's suggestion--it must
be spoken in a language that the spell recipient understands.
<P></P>
The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the action sound
reasonable; asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear,
immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the
effect of the spell. However, a suggestion that a pool of acid was actually pure
water and that a quick dip would be refreshing is another matter. Urging a red
dragon to stop attacking the wizard's party so that the dragon and party could
jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere is likewise a reasonable use of the
spell's power.
<P></P>
The course of action of a suggestion can continue in effect for a considerable
duration, such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above. Conditions
that will trigger a special action can also be specified; if the condition is not
met before the spell expires, the action will not be performed. If the target
successfully rolls its saving throw, the spell has no effect. Note that a very
reasonable suggestion causes the saving throw to be made with a penalty (such
as -1, -2, etc.) at the discretion of the DM. Undead are not subject to
suggestion.
<P></P>
The material components of this spell are a snake's tongue and either a bit of
honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil.
