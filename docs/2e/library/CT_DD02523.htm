There are three basic problems with fighting in a dungeon or cave: first, the
fight usually takes place in a confined area; second, lighting may be a
critical issue for characters who don?t have infravision; and last but not least, the
monsters usually know their own homes well. Unfortunately, most PCs end up
going into dungeons or caves to confront monsters in their lairs.

Overall, dungeons or caves may be the most dangerous places to have a fight.
The lighting is poor, the footing is questionable, and there are all kinds of
possibilities for traps and ambushes. The cramped quarters eliminate all but the
most rudimentary choices of tactics and strategy.

When preparing a dungeon battle for the PCs, the DM should note the
characteristics of the area in advance. Just about anything can live in a dungeon, and
almost any kind of furniture or obstacles can be found there.
