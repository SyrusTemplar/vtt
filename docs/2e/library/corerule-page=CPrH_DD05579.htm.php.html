<P></P>
These gods are much like gods of communities, but the sites they represent
don't have to be occupied. A site-god could be the deity of a mountain, a cave, a
plain, or a valley. These are usually minor gods, one god to a site. Generally,
the sites are famous <I>because</I> they are the dwellings of gods; however, the gods seldom let themselves be
seen.
<P></P>
Priests of these gods are protectors of the sites, and all living things which
dwell there. Because of this, the priests seldom leave those sites, and so
this is not usually a good choice for a player-character. Only when the site is
threatened by distant powers is the priest allowed to leave the site for
adventures.
<P></P>
Site gods are as likely to be male as female.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Ancestors and
Community.
<P></P>
<B>Alignment:</B> A deity who is the patron of a single site will probably be true neutral; his
interest is in the survival and veneration of the site, with little interest
in the doings of men. Their priests may be of any neutral alignment, but neutral
evil priests gather in one cult, while true neutral and neutral good priests
gather in a second; they won't be friendly to one another. The flock may be of
any alignment. The DM can decide that a particular site deity is neutral good,
in which case there will be no evil priests or flock; or that he is neutral
evil, in which case there will be no good priests or flock.
