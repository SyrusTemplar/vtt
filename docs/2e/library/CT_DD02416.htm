No-move actions are just that—the character performs some sort of action
during her proper action phase, whether it is fighting an opponent or using a wand,

her action phase. She can move one square in any direction and choose any facing
as a free adjustment to her position. If the character is threatened, she can
adjust her position without provoking an attack of opportunity by making sure
that her adjustment does not take her out of the enemy’s front squares or turn
her back to him. No-move actions include:
