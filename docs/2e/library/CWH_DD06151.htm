<B>Character Description:</B> No one enjoys being a wizard more than the Showman. He delights in dazzling
friends and foes alike with surprising, dramatic magical effects. Nothing stirs
the heart of a Showman more than learning a new magical effect or putting a new
twist on an old spell. He sees magic as a fine art, comparable to sculpting,
composing, and painting. He has more appreciation for a well-executed cantrip
than for a mundanely-cast 9th-level spell.
<P></P>
The Showman casts spells with a flair. He considers both opponents and allies
as potential audiences. If a spell requires a short phrase for its verbal
component, he'll incorporate the phrase in a song or poem. If a spell requires him
to point at a subject, he will use a series of elaborate and dramatic gestures
to arrive at pointing his finger. His alteration spells are strikingly
imaginative; his illusions are breathtaking works of art. Nothing frustrates a Showman
more than having to use a spell in the same way twice, especially if his
audience of friends or foes has seen it previously.
<P></P>
The Showman's flamboyance is easily matched by his ego. He wallows in the
approval of others; applause is like music to him, a compliment is like food to a
starving man. However, even the most casual criticism can send him sulking and
an insult can devastate him.
<P></P>
Most often, the Showman is cheerful and upbeat. Most people find him great fun
to be around, and no one can argue that his approach to magic is genuinely
entertaining. This is a good character type for players who want to introduce more
humor and playfulness into a campaign.

<B>Best Suited For:</B> The spontaneity typical of the chaotic alignments makes them good choices for
the Showman, but good and evil alignments are appropriate (the good-aligned
Showman loves to share his skills with others and bring smiles to their faces;
the evil-aligned Showman enjoys frightening and intimidating them). The Showman
is not likely to be drawn to the cautious and self-centered neutral alignments.
<P></P>
The Showman is best suited for the Amazon, Peasant Wizard, Witch, and Wu Jen
kits. The Academician tends to be too cerebral, the Anagakok and the Militant
Wizard too serious, the Savage Wizard too unsophisticated, the Mystic too
introspective, and the Patrician too stuffy.

<B>In Combat Situations:</B> The Showman relishes combat, since it gives him a perfect opportunity to show
off his spells. Needless to say, the Showman will always go for the most
spectacular, dramatic, and dazzling effects-- if he wants to scare away an opponent
with <I>phantasmal force</I>, why create a simple ogre or troll when he can create a multi-headed werewolf
with purple tentacles and 10-inch golden fangs? Unfortunately, his flair for
the dramatic sometimes finds him squandering his higher-levels spells
unnecessarily, such as in using<I> lightning bolt</I> when the less-spectacular <I>magic missile</I> would be just as effective.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>In Role-Playing Situations:</B> Since the Showman views all new acquaintances as potential audiences, he
enjoys meeting people from all walks of life. The Showman is especially fond of
members of the opposite sex, and will often go to great lengths to impress and
dazzle them, sometimes at the expense of the business at hand. Most NPCs see the
Showman as endearing and charming, but some find his attention-getting antics
obnoxious.
<P></P>
Among his companions, the Showman is appreciated for his pleasant attitude and
positive outlook. He is always able to boost morale with a clever trick or
entertaining demonstration. At times, PC leaders might have a problem impressing
the Showman with the seriousness of a situation or getting him to focus on an
important task, but flattery or indulgence usually get the Showman's cooperation
