Throwing a punch or trying to get a wrestling hold on the enemy is always a
legitimate attack. As noted in <A HREF="DD02388.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02388.htm">Chapter One</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, trying to engage an armed opponent in unarmed combat is risky; if the armed
character threatens the attacker, he gets an immediate attack of opportunity.
<P></P>
There are several types of unarmed attacks that can be employed by a
character, including punching, wrestling, martial arts, and overbearing. The various
types of unarmed combat are described in great detail in <A HREF="DD02666.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02666.htm">Chapter Five</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">. Note that a character has to have a hand free to punch or wrestle someone.
