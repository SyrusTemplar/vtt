</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Practitioners of the Art employ a variety of magical venoms and potions to
achieve their ends. From the <I>DMG,</I> <I>dust of sneezing and choking</I>, <I>elixirs of health</I> and <I>madness,</I> <I>potions of extra-healing, healing, longevity, poison, undead control,</I> and <I>vitality </I>are most likely to be included in the recipe book of the necromancer or death
priest, either for personal use or for use on others (in the case of harmful
items). From the <I>TOM</I>, these spellcasters will sometimes also employ air spores, curdled death and
powder of the black veil as poisons in combat. The list of venoms found on page
73 of the <I>DMG</I> provides a general background of non-magical poisons for the campaign.
Certain necromancers, such as the Archetype or Witch, may also be experts at
harvesting natural poisons from animals and monsters such as snakes, spiders,
scorpions, wyverns, and the like.
<P></P>
Many of the necromantic secret societies employ magical venoms and unique
potions that are created and distributed only to members of their organizations.
The Scabrous Society and the Cult of Pain, in particular, relish the use of
enchanted poisons like <I>deathdust</I>. Even the righteous Death Lords have developed an enchanted venom, called <I>soultravel.</I> Of all the death priests, only Stranglers disavow all use of poison in their
holy slayings.
<P></P>
Many necromancers, working independently, have also developed several
insidious poisons of varying efficacy and magical potency. Undead Masters use a variety
of deadly potions (like <I>ju-ju wine</I>) that transform the unfortunate drinker into an undead. Other ointments, such
as <I>ghast salve</I>, provide protection or even power over special types of undead.
<P></P>
Along with these specialized necromantic elixirs, evil wizards also tend to
use exotic but otherwise normal poisons to an alarming extent. Even a mundane
zombie can become a major threat to a party of adventurers when it wields a
dreambliss-envenomed sword given to it by its master. As recounted in the Captain
Omar’s introductory tale in Chapter Seven, a powerful necromancer like Pizentios
can (and will) effectively use poison to sedate a large group of opponents.
<P></P>
Natural poisons—such as dreambliss and mind-shadow—that induce slumber or
disorientation in opponents are especially valuable to necromancers, who cannot
bring about such effects with their spells. These poisons are sometimes used for
medicinal purposes by the Anatomist, but there are many times when a villain
wants to render victims helpless or unconscious. Without access to spells from the
schools of Illusion or Enchantment/Charm, necromancers must resort to poisons
to achieve similar ends.
<P></P>
Keep in mind, while perusing the following list of new potions and venoms,
that the final decision about whether necromancers and their secret societies
actually do employ certain poisons (or any at all) with any sort of regularity is
left to the DM. Prices for normal venoms, which might also be made available to
PCs (at the DM’s discretion), are listed when appropriate.
<P></P>
<B>Ju-ju Wine:</B> This fragrant liquid appears to be a dark red wine. In fact, it is an
insidious <I>potion of poison</I>. If even a sip is tasted by a human, demihuman, or humanoid, the wine brings
instant death unless the victim makes a saving throw vs. death magic. If
failed, the victim is permanently transformed into a ju-ju zombie who automatically
obeys the commands of the first person who speaks to him or her. The zombie can
be turned or affected by magical items that influence undead, but the victim
cannot be restored except with a <I>wish, raise dead,</I> or similar necromancy.
<P></P>
A second, less toxic vintage of <I>ju-ju wine</I> is also known to exist. This milder, white-wine variety turns the victim into
a “living” ju-ju zombie for 2–5 days, who (as with the more potent variety)
mindlessly obeys the first person who speaks to him or her. However, since the
victim is not truly dead, he or she cannot be turned or commanded by a priest.
Until the effects of the lesser potion expire, the victim temporarily loses all
racial, class-related, and professional abilities. (150 XP.)
<P></P>
<B>Dreambliss:</B> This powerful (non-magical) narcotic is derived from the sticky white sap of
a thick-leafed jungle or desert plant. Dreambliss quickly sedates even the
largest opponents. Victims struck by a coated weapon must save vs. poison to resist
its potent effect.
<P></P>
If the victim fails the save, he or she falls into a deep, euphoric “Sleep of
Bliss” lasting 2–8 hours. The onset time depends on the victim’s size: S (1
round), M (1–2 rounds), L-G (2–5 rounds). Upon waking from the poison-induced
slumber, most victims remember happy, dreamlike visions that they long to
experience someday again.
<P></P>
Dreambliss is sometimes used as a recreational drug in rich circles, but the
addictive poison quickly drains its victims of all Wisdom (permanent loss of 1
point per month of repeated use) and wealth before long. The poison’s
effectiveness against even large-sized monsters makes it popular among both adventurers
and criminals. A single dose costs from 200–1,200 gp.
<P></P>
<B>Deathdust:</B> This deadly magical powder can be used as either contact or insinuative
poison. An arrowhead need only be sprinkled with a pinch of the powder and touch the
skin to be effective. Clearly, the powder must be handled extremely carefully
by trained individuals.
<P></P>
<I>Deathdust</I> acts almost instantly, with an onset time of 1–3 rounds, during which time it
causes an irritating burning sensation and may be reversed with a <I>dispel magic</I> (successful against 12th-level magic). Otherwise, the necromantic powder
causes the victim to literally fester, decay, and desiccate into a pile of dry dust
within a single round if a saving throw vs. death magic is not made. Deathdust
is sometimes applied to an enemy’s doorknob or sprinkled into a pouch of gold
given as a gift. It is said to smell like myrrh.
<P></P>
<B>Ghast Salve:</B> Only a few powerful necromancers know the secret of creating this sickly
green ointment. The cream’s powers activate one round after being spread upon the
recipient’s body. The recipient gains immunity to paralysis and to the stench of
ghasts. The user of <I>ghast salve</I> also exudes the same stench of ghasts and can paralyze others if the victims
fail a saving throw vs. paralysis. Finally, regular ghouls and ghasts will
regard the recipient in an extremely favorable light (as if he or she had an 18
Charisma). The subject gains a +7 reaction adjustment with these forms of undead.
<P></P>
<I>Ghast salve</I> reacts strongly with holy water. If struck by such liquid, the recipient
suffers damage as though he or she were truly undead (1d6+1 points of damage for a
direct hit, 2 hp for a splash). Typically, 1d3 jars, each containing up to
three applications, will be found. A single application lasts for an hour. (500
XP/jar.)
<P></P>
<B>Mindshadow:</B> This non-magical poison is brewed from a variety of arboreal fungus and is
available in most temperate climes for between 300–1,800 gp per dose. When
introduced into a human’s bloodstream, mindshadow causes extreme disorientation and
both visual and auditory hallucinations in the victim, who must make a saving
throw vs. poison to resist the effect (onset time is only 1–3 rounds).
<P></P>
Victims failing their save become <I>confused</I> (as per the wizard spell) for 5–20 turns. During that time, the victim is
highly susceptible to <I>suggestion</I> (–6 penalty to the saving throw to refuse a specific request) by anyone
conversing with or questioning the victim. Mindshadow can be used in combat to
disorient opponents, but it is much more often employed by necromancers during the
interrogation of prisoners. Since it leaves the victim almost totally at the
mercy of frightening hallucinations and suggestions, mindshadow is rarely used as
a recreational drug.
<P></P>
Mindshadow only works effectively with humans. Other races and monsters gain a
+1 to +4 bonus to their save (onset time 2–12 rounds, depending on their
physical size and the amount of poison employed). If they fail, they are only <I>slowed</I> (as the wizard spell) for 2–12 turns (with no susceptibility to suggestion,
as in humans). Dwarves are immune to the poison’s effects.
<P></P>
<B>Soultravel:</B> This magical poison, which can be absorbed directly via the skin, is used by
the priests of the Dead and certain Philosophers to loosen the bond between a
person’s body and spirit. Victims are entitled to a saving throw vs. spells to
resist the effect if unwilling.
<P></P>
If the save is failed, soultravel forces the victim’s spirit to surrender his
or her physical body and enter the Ethereal Plane, much like an undead ghost.
However, unless she or he has had extensive experience with <I>soultravel</I>, the ethereal victim will be completely helpless and disoriented on the
Ethereal Plane. Meanwhile, his or her physical body remains in a deathlike coma. The
victim cannot physically attack those in the physical world, although he or
she can still cast spells and use psionic abilities.
<P></P>
<I>Soultravel</I> is not for the casual user. Strong doses of the venom will sever the bond
between the body and spirit irrevocably, effectively killing the victim. The
victim can also be slain by casting spirit release, dispel magic, or dispel
evil/good while his or her ethereal form is further than 30’ from the physical body.
However, if the ethereal form is close enough to the body when any of these
spells are cast, the spirit and body are reunited.
<P></P>
Unless prematurely ended by magical spells, as outlined above, the effects of
soultravel usually last for 4–16 turns. Upon awakening, the subject loses 2–8
points of Constitution, which are regained at a rate of 1 point per day of rest.
(400 XP.)
