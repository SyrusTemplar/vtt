<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Skie's Locks and Bolts:</B> This device looks like a small, ornate lock with a tiny silver key. When the
key is turned clockwise, all doors, windows and other portals within 50 feet of
the item slam shut and become <I>wizard locked</I>. For purposes of opening them, the <I>wizard locks</I> are the equivalent of those cast by a 12th-level wizard. The effect lasts
until the key is twisted counterclockwise or the device is transported more than
50 feet away.
<P></P>
<I>Skie's locks and bolts</I> are sometimes found in the homes of wealthy merchants and secretive wizards.
