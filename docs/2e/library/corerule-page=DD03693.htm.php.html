By anticipating possible futures and outcomes of the caster’s actions, this
spell provides the character with a temporary sixth sense or feel for danger. The
spell operates on a subconscious level, and the caster receives strong
intuitive impulses when he contemplates courses of action that may bring immediate
physical injury or harm to him. For example, if the priest was about to open a
trapped chest, the <I>unfailing premonition </I>would create a flash of insight or a gut feeling telling him that he shouldn’t
do so. Similarly, opening a door that leads into the lair of a ferocious troll
may also trigger the spell’s warning. Threatening a NPC who is likely to
respond by drawing a weapon and attacking the PC would create a warning, but
threatening a NPC who will get even with the priest in an hour or two will not trigger
the <I>premonition.</I>
<P></P>
The <I>unfailing premonition </I>is also quite useful in combat, as long as the priest obeys his instincts and
ducks, dodges, or withdraws when his subconscious tells him to. While the spell
is in effect, the priest gains a +2 bonus to his Armor Class and saving
throws, but in any given round there is a 25% chance that he will have to forego his
intended action in order to obey the spell’s warning impulses.
<P></P>
The <I>premonition </I>only works on actions undertaken by the priest himself. If his companion is
about to pull a mysterious lever that will drop a 10-ton block of stone on the
priest, he receives no warning.
