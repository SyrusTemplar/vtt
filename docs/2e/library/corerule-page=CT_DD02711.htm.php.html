The critical hit charts require two die rolls: one to determine the location
of the hit, and the other to determine the severity. Note that these can be
rolled simultaneously. The location die is usually a single d10, but there are some
exceptions.

<A NAME="96bad379"></A><B>Called Shots. </B>If a character hits with a called shot and scores a critical hit, the location
die is ignored. The location is automatically determined to be wherever the
character had been aiming.

<A NAME="f3603deb"></A><B>Low Attacks. </B>If the attacker is fighting a creature two sizes larger or a defender with a
distinct height advantage, use a single d6 for location. Head and upper torso
shots become extremely unusual in these cases.

<A NAME="f0418b11"></A><B>High Attacks. </B>If the attacker is two sizes larger than the defender, or has a significant
<P></P>
height advantage, roll 1d6+4. Giants fighting halflings donâ€™t often strike
them low.
