</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Sapping is an attempt to knock out an opponent by striking with the flat of
the blade or slugging him from behind with a sturdy sword-hilt. It doesn’t work
very well against characters or monsters that are expecting it; any character
attempting to sap a creature that threatens her provokes an attack of opportunity
for the defender. Hand-held weapons and thrown weapons may be used in sap
attempts.
<P></P>
A sap is a type of called shot; it has a one-phase initiative penalty, and the
attacker has a –4 penalty to hit. The penalty increases to –8 if the defender
is wearing some kind of helmet. Only Small or Medium creatures can be sapped;
Large monsters can’t be knocked out like this.
<P></P>
If the attacker scores a hit, she may knock out her opponent. There is a 5%
chance per point of damage of knocking out the victim, up to a maximum of 40%.
Thus, if the sapper inflicts 5 points of damage, she has a 25% chance of knocking
out her opponent. Sapping damage is like unarmed combat damage; 25% is real
and the rest is temporary. Naturally, if her damage roll exceeds the victim’s hit
points, he’s knocked out anyway.
<P></P>
The knockout chance increases to 10% per point of damage (max 80%) if the
victim is surprised, asleep, restrained, or magically held in some way. Sapped
characters remain unconcious for 3d10 full rounds.
