</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Kits are role-playing aids that help the DM (or player) further define a
character. The following kits represent distinct sub-classes of the necromancer
wizard, each with its own goals, qualifications, and roles for the campaign. With
the DMâ€™s permission, a select few (such as the Anatomist, Deathslayer, or
Philosopher) may be made available to PC wizards, subject to the concerns raised in
the Introduction.
