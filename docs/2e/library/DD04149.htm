A unique feature of clerical magic is faith magic. Using this special category
of priest spells, clerics can create semipermanent wards, sanctify ground,
ensure good harvests, or even improve the health of followers. In short, this
amplified magic allows certain clerical spells to be increased and intensified
through the combined efforts of priests and worshipers. Range, area of effect,
duration, and even damage can be altered through devotion and combined spellcasting.

To gain this ability, priests and their worshipers form groups to create faith
magic. Clerics of nearly all religions seek out worshipers, establish temples,
retire to monasteries, and establish seminaries. While there are many mundane
reasons to form such groups, priests' attitudes are also shaped by this
important difference between clerical and wizardly magic -- the ability to combine
magical power. Wizard spells lack this property--even a large number of wizards
cannot combine their spells into a whole. Thus, wizards gain no magical benefits
from founding monasteries or attracting followers.
