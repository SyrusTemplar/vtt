</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Intelligence (Int) represents a character's memory, reasoning, and learning
ability, including areas outside those measured by the written word. Intelligence
dictates the number of languages a character can learn. Intelligence is the
prime requisite of wizards, who must have keen minds to understand and memorize
magical spells. A wizard with an Intelligence score of 16 or higher gains a 10%
bonus to experience points earned. The wizard's Intelligence dictates which
spells he can learn and the number of spells he can memorize at one time. Only
those of the highest Intelligence can comprehend the mighty magic of 9th-level
spells.

This ability gives only a general indication of a character's mental acuity. A
semi-intelligent character (Int 3 or 4) can speak (with difficulty) and is apt
to react instinctively and impulsively. He is not hopeless as a player
character (PC), but playing such a character correctly is not easy. A character with
low Intelligence (Int 5-7) could also be called dull-witted or slow. A very
intelligent person (Int 11 or 12) picks up new ideas quickly and learns easily. A
highly intelligent character (Int 13 or 14) is one who can solve most problems
without even trying very hard. One with exceptional intelligence (Int 15 or 16)
is noticeably above the norm. A genius character is brilliant (Int 17 or 18). A
character beyond genius is potentially more clever and more brilliant than can
possibly be imagined.
<P></P>
However, the true capabilities of a mind lie not in numbers--I.Q.,
Intelligence score, or whatever. Many intelligent, even brilliant, people in the real
world fail to apply their minds creatively and usefully, thus falling far below
their own potential. Don't rely too heavily on your character's Intelligence
score; you must provide your character with the creativity and energy he supposedly
possesses!

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Number of Languages</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">lists the number of additional languages the character can speak beyond his
native language. Every character can speak his native language, no matter what
his Intelligence is. This knowledge extends only to speaking the language; it
does not include reading or writing. The DM must decide if your character begins
the game already knowing these additional languages or if the number shows only
how many languages your character can possibly learn. The first choice will
make communication easier, while the second increases your opportunities for
role-playing (finding a tutor or creating a reason why you need to know a given
language). Furthermore, your DM can limit your language selection based on his
campaign. It is perfectly fair to rule that your fighter from the Frozen Wastes
hasn't the tongues of the Southlands, simply because he has never met anyone who
has been to the Southlands.
