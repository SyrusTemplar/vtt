<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A simple wall offers no cover to characters standing on it. Castle designers,
however, had several ways to rectify the problem:
<P></P>
<A NAME="eea90be2"></A><B>Battlement: </B>This is a barrier about six feet high with alternating solid parts (merlons)
and openings (embrasures). A battlement gives Man-sized creatures standing
behind it 50% cover while actively defending the wall against attacks coming from
below the battlement. The best cover an active defender can claim from attacks
coming from the battlementâ€™s level or higher (for example, from attackers atop a
siege tower) is 25%. A wall less than 10 feet thick requires a catwalk to make
a battlement useful.
<P></P>
<A NAME="935a4817"></A><B>Catwalk: </B>This is a narrow ledge that allows defenders to hide behind the wall. It
grants 25% cover against attacks coming from below.
<P></P>
<A NAME="1d385bde"></A><B>Embrasure Shutter: </B>These heavy wooden shutters can be added to a battlement to increases the
cover value to 75% against all attacks.
<P></P>
<A NAME="23e3ac1a"></A><B>Hoarding: </B>This wooden construction is similar to a catwalk, but it is built on the
outside of the wall. It gives 90% cover to creatures attacking opponents at the base
of the wall, and 75% cover otherwise. A hoarding made of stone is called a
machicolation.
<P></P>
<A NAME="074975d3"></A><B>Splay: </B>This is an angled area at the base of a wall. It helps support the wall, and
makes it difficult for siege engines to attack the wall directly. If the
defenders drop rocks from atop a wall fitted with a splay, the weapons scatter if they
miss. Use the bombardment engine scatter diagram, but treat a roll of 5, 6, or
7 as a roll of 2. The rock bounces one square in the indicated direction. War
machines are automatically struck and creatures must roll a successful saving
throw vs. breath weapon or be struck, regardless of Armor Class.
