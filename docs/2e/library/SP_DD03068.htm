<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Religion:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character with this proficiency is familiar with the basic tenets of the
major and minor faiths practiced in the campaign world. Observing an act of
religious significance-a blessing of warriors before battle, for example-means the
character understands the importance of the ritual without a proficiency check.
Checks are required to understand the activities of unique or foreign
religions. Additional character points spent on this proficiency can expand a
character-s knowledge to include other religions, or can increase the level of detailed
knowledge about the faiths already studied.
