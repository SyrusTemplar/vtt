Engineers can prepare plans for everything from simple machines (catapults, river
locks, grist mills) to large buildings (fortresses, dams). A proficiency check is
required only when designing something particularly complicated or unusual. An
engineer must still find talented workmen to carry out his plan, but he is
trained to supervise and manage their work.

An engineer is also familiar with the principles of siegecraft and can detect
flaws in the defenses of a castle or similar construction. He knows how to
construct and use siege weapons and machines, such as catapults, rams, and screws.
