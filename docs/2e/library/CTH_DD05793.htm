Characters with this proficiency have cultivated exceptionally acute powers of
observation. The DM may ask for a proficiency check (or secretly roll it
himself) anytime there is something subtly askew; he may also allow characters with
observation to increase their chance of finding secret or concealed doors by 1
in 6. The proficiency covers all the senses.

<I>Example:</I> Julina is questioning a man who claims to be a craftsman who has worked on
the palace; she is searching for the most discreet entrance. The DM secretly
rolls an observation proficiency check; it is successful. &quot;You notice,&quot; he tells
her, &quot;that his hands are in beautiful condition, entirely lacking callouses.&quot;
From this observation, Julina may deduce that the man is actually just posing as a
craftsman; he may be a con man taking advantage of a few free drinks or coins,
or he could even be a spy for her enemies.
