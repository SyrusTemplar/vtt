</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Foresee: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The spell reads the future. The caster poses a single question and receives an
answer. The spell’s final difficulty depends on the how far into the future
the caster delves (use <A HREF="DD01336.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01336.htm">Table 32</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) and the actual range to the subject. The answer is truthful, but often
cryptic and always literal. For example, a spell that asks the fate of a king has an
adjusted difficulty of 125 (base 25 plus 100 for an unspecified time frame)
and is likely to reveal only that the king eventually dies. Careful wording of a
question can produce clearer results.
<P></P>
By tripling the base difficulty (75), the caster can extend one normal sense
(sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell) into the future, with additional
modifiers for the temporal and actual distance, as above.
<P></P>
There is no saving throw vs. a foresee spell unless the spell is used to
predict an unwilling creature’s alignment, intentions, or mental state.

information about the present or the past.
<P></P>
At base difficulty (20), the caster can project one normal sense to the limit
of the spell’s range. For the duration of the spell, the caster can see, hear,
smell, feel, or taste as though standing in the target area. If the target area
is larger than the five-foot-square default area, the caster’s point of view
can be freely shifted within the area. If the caster wishes to employ an
enchanted sense (microscopic vision, <I>ESP</I>, infravision, etc.), the base difficulty is doubled (40).
<P></P>
A reveal spell can also detect auras. At base difficulty (20), the caster can
perceive one aura, effect, or substance (magic, evil, invisibility, charm,
gold, etc.) by touch for the duration of the spell. Increasing the spell’s range
extends the caster’s detection ability in a 10-foot path that is as long as the
range. If the caster concentrates for one round, a ranged detection can
penetrate one yard of earth or wood, one foot of stone, or one inch of steel or other
metal. A thin sheet of lead blocks the detection. The caster—and only the
caster—perceives the aura through feedback to his senses (hands tingling, throbbing
headache, light intensity, etc.) and can tell where the source lies and how
powerful it is (faint, moderate, strong, or overwhelming).
<P></P>
Doubling the difficulty (40), doubles the penetration (up to one inch of lead)
and allows the caster to analyze what is detected (the type of magic, how much
gold, etc.). If there are multiple sources, only that fact is revealed;
analysis takes one round.
<P></P>
Tripling the difficulty (60) triples the penetration and allows complete
analysis. The caster can determine the subject’s alignment, all types of magic in
operation, etc. Each additional multiple of difficulty extends the penetration
range. At quintuple difficulty (100), a reveal spell bestows the power of <I>true seeing </I>(as the 5th-level priest spell).
<P></P>
A reveal spell allows the caster to sense or ask questions about the past just
as the foresee spell provides insights into the future. The past is easier to
divine that the future—divide the time periods on <A HREF="DD01336.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01336.htm">Table 32</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> by 10 when determining difficulty. For example, looking 10 years into the
past adds 70 to the difficulty.
<P></P>
A single use of the spell produces one effect (sense extension, aura reading,
or divining the past), though an ambitions caster could combine all three
functions into one very difficult spell.
<P></P>
There is no saving throw vs. a reveal spell unless the spell is used to
examine an unwilling creature’s alignment, thoughts, or mental state.
