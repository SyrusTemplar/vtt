<B>Character Description:</B> The Mystery Man is a genuine enigma. Surrounded in a veil of secrecy, his
motivations, his goals, and the details of his background are kept hidden from
even his closest companions. He favors dark clothing and speaks only when
necessary; his words are often cryptic or vague, suggesting that the Mystery Man knows
far more than he chooses to reveal.
<P></P>
No one is certain why the Mystery Man behaves as he does. Perhaps it is due to
an oath to an ancestor, or perhaps it is a neurotic compulsion. Whatever the
reason, the Mystery Man is clearly determined to operate on his own terms.
Consequently, the Mystery Man is a good personality type for players who feel
comfortable with offbeat characters.

<B>Best Suited For:</B> The Mystery Man is perfectly suited for neutral alignments, especially
neutral good and lawful neutral, but any alignments are possible. The Mystery Man's
reason for maintaining his veil of secrecy might suggest an appropriate
alignment. For instance, if he has taken an oath to avenge the death of his spouse, he
might be lawful good. If his magical aptitude makes him feel like an outcast
from society, but he still identifies with order and organization, he might be
lawful neutral. If he conceals his identity because he is an escaped criminal, he
might be lawful or neutral evil.

Any of the kits can be adapted to the Mystery Man.

<B>In Combat Situations:</B> Typically, the Mystery Man listens impassively to the orders of his leaders,
then fights as he chooses. The Mystery Man can be counted on to do the
unexpected; as a battle gets underway, he may suddenly vanish, then abruptly appear in
the midst of an opposing force. He might use <I>control undead</I> to command undead creatures to lift him to their shoulders and carry him into
battle. He might<I> summon shadow</I> for a whispered conversation, dismiss the shadow, then use<I> light</I> to make himself glow while he attacks an opponent.
<P></P>
While his fighting style is eccentric, it is startlingly effective. Opponents
are usually baffled by the Mystery Man's tactics or are intimidated by his
manner and appearance. For these reasons, the Mystery Man is a first-rate
combatant.

<P></P>
<B>In Role-Playing Situations:</B> The very presence of the Mystery Man is enough to make many NPCs
uncomfortable. While he usually lets his companions do most of the talking, NPCs often are
so intimidated by the Mystery Man that they are quick to cooperate just to get
rid of him. Many NPCs of the opposite sex find that the Mystery Man's veil of
secrecy makes him intriguing and extremely attractive. While polite and
considerate to his companions, the Mystery Man has no interest in socializing with them.
