<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The culture lists include the following information:
<P></P>
<B>Name: </B>Most weapons have been described by their common AD&amp;D equivalent, so a <I>flamberge </I>or <I>zweihander </I>is simply referred to as a two-handed sword. There are some exceptions—for
example, the gladius, which is just a short sword. The individual weapon
descriptions that follow the tables make note of any additional names by which the
weapon is known.
<P></P>
<B> Cost: </B>Each weapon has a listed cost based on the standard AD&amp;D monetary system. Many
weapons have different costs on different tables; these are weapons that are
rarer in the one setting than the other. If the weapon has a “—” for cost, it is
effectively free, since it can easily be made by any character.
