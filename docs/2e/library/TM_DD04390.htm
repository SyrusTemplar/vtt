This spell allows the caster to summon weather that is either appropriate or
inappropriate to the climate and season of the region. The summoned effects are
always dramatic--cool breezes or light fog will not appear. Instead, torrential
floods will assault a desert, a heat wave will rage in polar wastelands, and
tornadoes and hurricanes will rip across gentle landscapes. A blizzard might
spring up in summer or a tornado might materialize in the winter.
<P></P>
The spellcaster has no influence over the weather pattern that emerges. He
cannot control the area of effect or the duration of the weather.
<P></P>
Four turns after the spell is cast, the trend of the weather will become
apparent--a sudden chill, gust of wind, overcast sky, etc. The uncontrolled weather
arrives on the fifth turn. Once the weather has arrived, it cannot be
dispelled. If the spell is canceled by the caster before the beginning of the fifth
turn, the weather slowly reverts to its original condition.
<P></P>
The effects of the spell are the decision of the DM. The effects should be
grand and impressive. Following are suggested effects of the weather.
<P></P>
<I>Torrential Rain/Blizzard: </I>Visibility is reduced to 100 yards or less; travel is nearly impossible due to
water or heavy snow on the ground.
<P></P>
<I>Storm/Hurricanes:</I> All flying creatures are driven from the skies; trees are uprooted; roofs are
torn off; ships are endangered.
<P></P>
<I>Heat Wave</I>: Intense heat immediately causes ice bridges to melt; avalanches of snow and
ice roll down mountains.
<P></P>
The DM determines the area of effect randomly. The maximum duration of the
spell is one turn per level of the caster; however, the DM may cancel the effect
after a shorter time.
