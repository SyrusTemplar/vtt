This spell turns natural rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud. If it
is cast upon a rock, for example, the rock affected collapses into mud. Magical
or enchanted stone is not affected by the spell. The depth of the mud created
cannot exceed 10 feet. Creatures unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free
themselves from the mud sink at the rate of 1/3 of their height per round and
eventually suffocate, save for lightweight creatures that could normally pass across
such ground. Brush thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on
top of it, with the amount required decided by the DM. Creatures large enough
to walk on the bottom can move through the area at a rate of 10 feet per round.
<P></P>
The mud remains until a successful<I> dispel magic</I> or <I>transmute mud to rock</I> spell restores its substance--but not necessarily its form. Evaporation turns
the mud to normal dirt at a rate of 1d6 days per 10 cubic feet. The exact time
depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.
<P></P>
The reverse,<I> transmute mud to rock</I>, hardens normal mud or quicksand into soft stone (sandstone or similar
mineral) permanently unless magically changed. Creatures in the mud are allowed a
saving throw to escape before the area is hardened to stone. Dry sand is
unaffected.
<P></P>
The material components for the spell are clay and water (or sand, lime, and
water for the reverse).
