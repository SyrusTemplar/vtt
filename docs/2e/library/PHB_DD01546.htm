the proficiency is chosen) to obey simple commands and perform tricks. A
character can spend additional proficiencies to train other types of creatures or
can improve his skill with an already chosen type. Creatures typically trained
are dogs, horses, falcons, pigeons, elephants, ferrets, and parrots. A character
can choose even more exotic creatures and monsters with animal intelligence
(although these are difficult to control).
<P></P>
A trainer can work with up to three creatures at one time. The trainer may
choose to teach general tasks or specific tricks. A general task gives the
creature the ability to react to a number of nonspecific commands to do its job.
Examples of tasks include guard and attack, carry a rider, perform heavy labor,
hunt, track, or fight alongside soldiers (such as a war horse or elephant). A
specific trick teaches the trained creature to do one specific action. A horse may
rear on command, a falcon may pluck a designated object, a dog may attack a
specific person, or a rat may run through a particular maze. With enough time, a
creature can be trained to do both general tasks and specific tricks.
<P></P>
Training for a general task requires three months of uninterrupted work.
Training for a specific trick requires 2d6 weeks. At the end of the training time, a
proficiency check is made. If successful, the animal is trained. If the die
roll fails, the beast is untrainable. An animal can be trained in 2d4 general
tasks or specific tricks, or any combination of the two.
<P></P>
An animal trainer can also try to tame wild animals (preparing them for
training later on). Wild animals can be tamed only when they are very young. The
taming requires one month of uninterrupted work with the creature. At the end of
the month, a proficiency check is made. If successful, the beast is suitable for
training. If the check fails, the creature retains enough of its wild behavior
to make it untrainable. It can be kept, though it must be leashed or caged.
