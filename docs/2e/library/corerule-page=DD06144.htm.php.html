<B>Character Description:</B> The Commander is a natural leader who exudes authority. This may be due to
his upbringing, his training, his innate tendencies, his birth order (these types
tend to be first-born), or any combination of these factors, but whatever the
reasons, taking charge comes automatically to the Commander. He is decisive,
imposing, and inspiring.
<P></P>
The safety of his companions is of paramount importance to the Commander, and
he feels personally responsible for their actions. The Commander is not always
the leader of his party-- he understands that a leader cannot function without
able followers-- but he always tends to act like one, issuing orders, taking
charge, and showing initiative whenever others are slow to act.
<P></P>
Players selecting this type of character should be prepared to make most of
the decisions for the group. If a player is uncomfortable with this role, he
would do better to choose a different personality type.

<B>Best Suited For:</B> Lawful and neutral are the most appropriate alignments for Commanders.
Characters of evil alignment might demonstrate good leadership, but are too
self-centered to fit the nature of this personality. Chaotic characters usually lack the
necessary discipline needed for leadership.
<P></P>
A Commander can take the Amazon, Anagakok, Militant Wizard, Patrician, Peasant
Wizard, Savage Wizard, or Wu Jen kit. Academicians tend to be too analytical
and Mystics are too self-absorbed. Most Witches will have difficulty gaining the
complete trust of their parties, though Witch Commanders are certainly
feasible.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>In Combat Situations:</B> A Commander is a master tactician and superb strategist. In combat, his mind
is constantly at work, looking for weaknesses in an enemy's defense, weighing
attack options, considering the best positions for friendly forces, and deciding
when to withdraw and when to press ahead. Even if someone else is actually in
charge, the Commander inevitably will be issuing orders and attempting to boost
his party's morale.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>In Role-Playing Situations:</B> Unless he is outranked or asked to refrain, the Commander will presume to
speak for the group in NPC encounters. He will negotiate a group rate for the
party at an inn, and speak to the local authorities about recruiting extra men for
an anticipated battle. Depending on his manner, NPCs may see the Commander as
either arrogant or accommodating, but they will always be impressed with his
self-confidence
