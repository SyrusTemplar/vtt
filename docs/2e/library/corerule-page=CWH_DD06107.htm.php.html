After checking them against existing spells, all potential spells of a new
school must be considered for play balance. Imagine that the wizard employs a
particular spell every day-- will constant use have any significant long-term
effects on the balance of the game?
<P></P>
Consider our potential metamorphic spells. <I>Evaporate</I> won't have any profound effects on the game, assuming it has reasonable
limitations (for instance, evaporating an entire ocean should be prohibited). At
best, <I>blood to dust</I> means one less opponent per day.
<P></P>
But <I>improved armor</I> presents a problem. Since our metamorphic spells are permanent, wouldn't a
transfigurist immediately improve all of his party's armor as much as he could?
Is this fair? We can't make the effects temporary, or we're violating the
definition of our school. Let's throw out <I>improved armor</I> and invent another spell later.
