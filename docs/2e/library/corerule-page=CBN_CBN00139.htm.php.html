<P></P>
<P></P>
Sphere: Necromantic
<P></P>
Range: 120 yards
<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>
Duration: 1 round/level
<P></P>
Casting Time: 9
<P></P>
Area of Effect: One individual/two levels
<P></P>
Saving Throw: Neg.
<P></P>

This spell asphyxiates individuals (chosen by the priest) who fail a saving
throw vs. death magic. If fewer than six individuals are targeted with this
spell, each receives a –1 penalty on their save (–2 for three creatures or less, –4
if the entire spell is focused on a single creature). This necromancy induces a
victim’s throat to constrict and his or her lungs to swell shut, similar to a
severe allergic reaction, for so long as the subject remains within range of
the spell.
<P></P>
Each round, a victim must attempt a Constitution check. If failed, the victim
suffers 1–6 points of damage. If successful, the subject manages to gasp in
enough air to reduce the damage to 1–3 points. During its struggles against <I>asphyxiation</I>, the affected creature becomes effectively <I>slowed</I> (as per the 3rd-level wizard spell). A victim who fails three consecutive
Constitution checks has been smothered and dies automatically on the following
round.
<P></P>
The effects of <I>asphyxiate</I> continue until either the spell expires, a victim withdraws beyond range of
the spell, or a successful <I>dispel magic</I> is employed on a victim. Victims remain slowed for 1–3 rounds after the spell
ends. This spell normally affects only humans or demihumans, though the DM may
extend the dominion of the spell to include man-sized or smaller animals and
monsters. Obviously, creatures (such as undead and plant creatures) that never
breathe cannot be affected by this spell.
<P></P>
The material component is an unholy symbol and a (symbolic) silken gag, which
the priest loosely wraps around his or her own mouth after casting the spell.
Because of its murderous effect, asphyxiate is typically granted only to priests
serving evil deities.
