<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fishing:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> A character with this proficiency knows how to catch fish with hook and line,
net, and spear. If fish are present in a body of water, a successful
proficiency check means the character has caught something. Typically, with a successful
check, the fisherman he will catch 1d6 fish in an hour. This number can be
doubled if many fish are present. It is reduced to one fish per hour if the
character is seeking large quarry—such as sturgeon, muskellunge, giant carp, or
salt-water fish.
