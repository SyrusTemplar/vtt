When the priest is a low-level character, still near the bottom of the totem
pole of the priesthood's hierarchy, his superiors will frequently send him on
missions. A mission could be nothing more than &quot;Take this letter over to the
priest Aclastion in the next village,&quot; or it could be &quot;There's supposed to be some
horrible monster menacing our temple in the next village; do you suppose you
could round up some of your more violent friends and go over there and destroy it
for us?&quot;
<P></P>
In the latter case, you have a situation where the priest character is the
center of attention, and has ample reason and opportunity to invite his non-priest
friends in on the action.
