</B>4. Be Aware of Demographics</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> High-level characters don?t just spring into existence overnight. It takes
an exceptional person just to survive the rigors of an adventuring life, and
characters who make it to the top should be both rare and famous.
<P></P>
Just how rare are high-level characters? Let?s assume, for purposes of this
example, that the minimum requirement for an adventurer is having an ability
score of 15 or better in a prime requisite in one of the four character classes
(Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Wisdom), a Constitution score of at least
9, and no other score lower than an 8. About one person in 10 meets these
requirements if ability scores are rolled using the standard method of rolling 3d6
once for each ability score. (If your campaign uses an alternate method for
rolling ability scores, what you?re really doing is making sure your PCs fall into
the top 10%, non-adventurers are still assumed to use the standard method).
Now, let?s assume that out of every group of adventures only half actually make it
to the next level (the remainder either die, retire, or just haven?t yet
accumulated enough experience to advance). This last assumption is an
oversimplification, of course, but a little arithmetic produces some instructive results:
<P></P>
<P></P>
There is only one 10th level character in a general population of 5,000. The
actual numbers are summarized in <A HREF="DD01169.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01169.htm">Table 1</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.

<P></P>
An 18th level character of any class is truly a one-in-a-million individual.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Only.2% of the population (1 in 500) qualifies to be a paladin. Other
subclasses with strict ability score requirements (such as bards, rangers, and druids)
are equally rare.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Keep these numbers in mind when creating NPCs for your campaign. Your world
not only becomes more believable if it isn?t overrun with super characters, but
your players have a greater sense of accomplishment when they realize just what
they have achieved. Be sure to keep important NPCs alive when possible?it can
take a generation to replace a high-level character.
