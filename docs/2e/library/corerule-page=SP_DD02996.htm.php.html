<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Sharpshooter </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Sharpshooters devote their time and effort to becoming extremely proficient
with missile weapons. They might be experts with thrown weapons such as the
dagger or hand axe. Some make their living as trick-shot artists in carnivals and
circuses. Sharpshooters may be military specialists assigned to attack and
dispose of enemy officers, wizards, airborne foes, or even enemy sharpshooters.
Others might be classic archers, able to split an opponent’s arrow in a target or
knock a foe’s weapon from his hand.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Social Ranks:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Sharpshooters usually come from middle-classed families who have money to
spend on weapons and lessons. Roll 2d6 to determine the social rank.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Requirements: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A sharpshooter must have a minimum Dexterity/Aim of 13. Bugbears, lizard men,
minotaurs, ogres, and wemics cannot become sharpshooters. This kit is barred to
wizards and priests (although the DM may allow some specialty priests, such as
druids, to become sharpshooters).
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> More than half of a sharpshooter’s initial weapon proficiencies (or at least
six character points) must be allocated on missile weapons. Expenditures for
missile weapon specialization or style specializations involving missile weapons
count toward the requirements.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Nonweapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Bowyer/fletcher, hunting, heraldry, riding, weaponsmithing.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Equipment:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> A sharpshooter’s first concern is making sure he has enough arrows or other
missile weapons. After that, he can purchase whatever armor and equipment is
appropriate to his adventuring class.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Traits:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Ambidexterity, keen eyesight, keen hearing, lucky.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Benefits:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Sharpshooters gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with one particular
missile weapon. The weapon must be chosen at the time of the character’s
creation. This bonus does not apply to a hurled missile weapon when it is used in
melee combat. For example, if a sharpshooter threw a spear at an oncoming
hobgoblin, he could apply the bonus. If he waited until the hobgoblin closed to melee
range, the bonus is no longer applicable.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hindrances:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Because a sharpshooter concentrates on missile weapons, he suffers a –1
penalty on initiative rolls for melee combat.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wealth:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Standard for the character’s class.
