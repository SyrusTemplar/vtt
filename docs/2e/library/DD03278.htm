This power allows the user to travel without his physical body by creating an
astral form that immediately leaps into the Astral Plane. Only creatures or
characters who are also on the Astral Plane can see it. A silvery cord connects
the astral body to the physical one. This translucent string stretches 10 feet
from the astral body before becoming invisible. If the cord is severed, both the
astral and physical bodies die?killing the user. The cord is nearly
indestructible, however. It only can be severed by a powerful psionic wind or the <I>silver sword</I> of a githyanki.
<P></P>
The Astral Plane is used to get to other destinations?a distant point on the
Prime Material or a location on another plane, for example. When the user
reaches his destination, a temporary physical body is formed there. It resembles the
user?s real body, and the two remain connected by the silvery cord. However, a
temporary physical body isn?t formed if the user travels to another location on
the same plane as his real body. He can view that distant location in astral
form, but he can?t affect the area in any physical, magical, or psionic way.
