This spell effects only “natural” stone. Stone which has been created or
protected by magic is unaffected, as is stone which has been artificially shaped on
all four sides. For example, the walls in a simple tunnel driven through solid
rock are subject to this spell, but if the tunnel were lined with brick or
stones that had been worked into blocks, a <I>transmute rock to mud </I>spell could not harm them. This spell still is very useful in a siege,
however, as virtually all castles must be built upon bedrock in order to support the
weight of the walls. It is possible to use a <I>transmute rock to mud </I>spell to undermine a wall by attacking the bedrock underneath, provided that
the spell has enough area to reach under the wall and that the mud can flow out
and leave a cavity under the wall. In some cases it might be necessary to
employ sappers or a <I>dig </I>spell to get at the bedrock and provide a place for the mud to go. If these
conditions are met, the wall still remains unaffected if the defender rolls a 10
or more on 1d20.
