This spell enchants any single room no larger than the area of effect. When
any creature larger than a normal rat (larger than one-half cubic foot or
weighing more than three pounds) enters the room, shrill shrieks begin to emanate from
the walls. The shrieks persist for 2-5 (1d4+1) rounds. The walls do not
undergo any physical change.
<P></P>
The shrieks can be heard only by creatures inside the room. Creatures hearing
the shrieks experience no ill effects on the first round, allowing them time to
leave the room or cover their ears. <I>Silence, 15' radius</I> protects against the effects.
<P></P>
Creatures who remain in the room during the second or subsequent rounds of the
shrieks who have not protected their hearing are penalized as follows:
