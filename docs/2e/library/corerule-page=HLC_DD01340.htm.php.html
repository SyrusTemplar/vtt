Any technique or unusual restriction that the caster imposes on himself during
the spell’s preparation time can reduce the spell’s adjusted or final
difficulty. Similarly, the caster can limit the way the spell is used and make the
spell easier to prepare and cast. Like material components, special conditions are
classified according to rarity.
<P></P>
<I>Common: </I>This is the minimum condition for preparing or casting a spell (see <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01321.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01321.htm.php.html">page 119</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">).
<P></P>
<I>Rare: </I>The condition requires some extra effort or extraordinary expense on the
caster’s part. The caster might remain in a locale that is particularly appropriate
for casting a spell; for example, staying in school or library when preparing a
reveal spell. The caster might refrain from taking a certain action during a
spell’s preparation time, such as never answering a question truthfully while
preparing a delude spell. The caster might specify a limited use for the spell,
such as a dispel that only works against afflictions that have been unjustly
laid.
<P></P>
A rare condition is not effective unless the character is exceptionally clever
or undergoes some hardship or sacrifice. Only one rare condition can apply to
any given spell, affecting either the adjusted or final difficulty. The DM must
be very careful when assigning limitations, as players tend to specify
limitations that only apply to the situation immediately at hand. A limitation reduces
difficulty only when it actually makes the spell harder for a player character
to use.
<P></P>
<I>Exotic: </I>The condition is unique, and the character must undertake an adventure to
complete it. An exotic condition often exists only in a metaphorical sense.
Shielding the innocent from a tyrant’s wrath might be useful in preparing a ward
spell. Carrying an idea to the four corners of the world might help with a transport
spell. Freeing a village from fear might help with a dispel, especially if the
target of the dispel and the source of the fear are one in the same. Only one
modifier for an exotic condition can apply to a single spell. The caster can
apply it to either the adjusted or final difficulty, but not both.
