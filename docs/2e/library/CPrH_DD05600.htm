<B>Description:</B> This priest belongs to an order devoted in large part to the study of
fighting styles, especially barehanded martial arts. These monks live and study in
monasteries devoted to their orders. If, for example, they are priests of the god
of War, these monks do not live and study in ordinary temples of that god; they
have their own secluded monastery away from the normal temples.
<P></P>
These monks do not confine their war-training to the monasteries, however.
They travel the wide world in order to learn the secrets of life, the world, magic
and the gods. As an order, they sometimes volunteer their services to rulers
in times of war, and act as elite forces against the enemy.
<P></P>
These monks are most appropriate for an oriental-flavored campaign and the DM
may wish to decide that they cannot be used in his campaign. Before you create
a Fighting-Monk character, consult your DM and ask if he is allowing the
Fighting-Monk kit in his campaign.
<P></P>
In order to be a fighting-monk, the character must have a Dexterity of 12 or
more.
<P></P>
If a fighting-monk wants to abandon this kit, he must go through a difficult
process in order to do so. He must not use any of his unarmed combat techniques
for three whole experience levels' worth of time. Once he's reached that third
experience level, he has forgotten his unarmed combat techniques and may resume
the wearing of armor; and, if he renounced some of his spheres of influence
when he became a fighting-monk, may now resume those lost spheres.
<P></P>
As an example, a fighting-monk priest at 5th level decides to renounce his
allegiance to the fighting-monk order. He adventures normally, still not wearing
armor but otherwise performing as a normal priest of his priest-class. He
abstains from using his unarmed combat techniques. At 8th level, he has abandoned his
fighting techniques and may once again wear the armor appropriate to his
priest-class.
<P></P>
If a character forgets himself and uses unarmed combat techniques during this
process, he must &quot;start over.&quot; It will be three experience levels from his <I>current</I> level, from the time he made the slip, until he can resume his priest-class.
<P></P>
<B>Barred:</B> A priest of any priesthood which starts out with Poor Fighting Abilities is
barred from this choice.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> In the campaign, this priest is the philosophical warrior whose principal
duty is self-enlightenment. He is less concerned with the ordinary priestly duties
(such as guidance, marriage, community service) than those priests, but will
still perform them; he just won't go out of his way to look for them, nor will
he normally volunteer for them (NPCs must ask his help in these matters). Such
characters are usually wanderers, which help make them appropriate for
adventuring parties. They do periodically return to their monasteries, to pass on the
learning they have acquired on the road, and to brush up on their
fighting-skills; the rest of the time they spend out in the world.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> This priest may choose or random-roll his secondary skill, if you are using
the secondary skills system in addition to the weapon/nonweapon proficiencies
system.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Required: See under &quot;Special Benefits,&quot; below. Otherwise, the priest may take
any weapon proficiencies which his specific priest class allows him; he may
not take any the class does not allow him.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Bonus Proficiency: Tumbling. Recommended: Riding (Land-Based), Artistic
Ability (any), Dancing, Reading/Writing, Religion.
<P></P>
<B>Equipment: </B>See &quot;Special Hindrances,&quot; below.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> The principal benefit of being a Fighting-Monk is that the character receives <I>two free weapon proficiency slots</I> which he must use to take Specialization in one of the three styles of
Unarmed Combat (Punching, Wrestling, or Martial Arts). These were described in
greater detail in <I>The Complete Fighter's Handbook</I>, but that information also appears here, in the &quot;Equipment and Combat&quot;
chapter. The Fighting-Monk is the only priest who can specialize in an Unarmed Combat
style. He can specialize in any or all of the three styles, but he may only
specialize in one of them at first experience level.
<P></P>
As a second benefit, regardless of what it says for the priest's class, the
Fighting-Monk has a Nonweapon Proficiency Group Crossover with <I>all five</I> Proficiency Groups (General, Priest, Rogue, Warrior, Wizard). No proficiency
he takes will cost double the usual number of slots.
<P></P>
The last of the Fighting-Monk's benefits is this: He doesn't have to spend all
his starting Weapon Proficiency slots at first level. He can save his unspent
proficiencies, and they do not &quot;go away.&quot; Later, he can spend them at a rate of
one proficiency per experience level to improve his martial arts or buy new
martial arts.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> This priest cannot wear any sort of armor. Additionally, if he's a
priest-class with Medium Combat Abilities, he must &quot;give up&quot; some of his Spheres of
Influence. He may have no more than <I>three </I>Major Accesses (one of which must be All) and two Minor Accesses. The player
may choose from the accesses he currently has which ones the character loses and
which he keeps.
<P></P>
Additionally, the priest may never own more things (weapons, treasure, money,
etc.) than he can carry on his back.
<P></P>
<B>Wealth Options:</B> The Fighting-Monk gets the usual 3d6x10 gp as starting money.
<P></P>
<B>Races:</B> No special limitations. Humans, elves and half-elves seem visually more
suited to this kit than dwarves, gnomes, and halflings, but the DM can allow those
races to take this kit if he so chooses.
