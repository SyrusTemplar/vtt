By concentrating for one round and making a successful skill check, the priest
can improve one of the three eligible ability scores to the value listed on
the table below. The improvement lasts one round per character level. Because the
majority of the character’s energy is directed to the improved ability score,
the other two ability scores are reduced by two for the same duration. The
priest can end the boost and restore the values of the other scores at any time. If
the character’s ability score is already higher than the value listed on the
table, this skill has no effect.

* The number of true dweomers—10th-level spells—the character can prepare,
have prepared, or cast in one day (see <A HREF="DD01337.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01337.htm">Chapter 6</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">).
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
The priest can take no other actions during the round the character is
concentrating on raising the selected ability score. Each attempt to raise an ability
score, successful or not, during a single day lowers the base skill score by
two; the skill cannot be used once the base score falls to zero or less.
<P></P>
Bonuses from an increased score are applied immediately when the skill
succeeds and are lost immediately when the boost’s duration ends. For example, a
priest who chooses to increase Wisdom immediately gains saving throw bonuses against
mental attacks but loses them again when the character’s Wisdom score returns
to normal. Likewise, the effects from altered ability scores are applied
immediately. The priest does not gain any bonus spells from this skill but does gain
immunity to certain spells for a Wisdom score of 19 or higher (see <A HREF="PHB_DD02347.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD02347.htm">Player’s Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, Table 5).
<P></P>
A character can have only one ability score improvement from this skill
operating at any given time.

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Divine Voice:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B> </B>Priests with this skill can speak with divine authority.
<P></P>
To use the skill, the priest must speak loudly and clearly for a full round.
With a successful skill check (made at the end of the round), the priest’s voice
takes on a divine quality. Every creature within 180 feet can hear the priest
speaking unless it has been magically deafened. The divine voice penetrates
silence spells and up to 10 feet of solid rock or three inches of lead. <I>Antimagic shells, prismatic spheres, cubes of force</I>, and 10th-level ward spells shield their occupants.
<P></P>
Creatures that hear the voice are automatically <I>enthralled </I>(as the 2nd-level priest spell) if they have less than 5 Hit Dice or levels.
Other creatures can save vs. spell to avoid the effect. Creatures do not have to
understand the priest’s words, they merely have to hear them. Undead and
creatures normally immune to charm spells, such as golems and creatures with
Wisdom/Willpower scores of 19 or more, are not affected.
<P></P>
The priest can hold an audience enthralled for up to one hour, as per the <I>enthrall </I>spell, but excessive jeering can break the effects (see the spell description
in the <A HREF="PHB_DD02152.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD02152.htm">Player’s Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">). The priest can also utter a <I>mass suggestion </I>to creatures the character has enthralled; this functions as the 6th-level
wizard spell of the same name except that it effects every creature currently
enthralled regardless of the priest’s level. There is no saving throw vs. the <I>mass suggestion </I>if it is completed before the <I>enthrall </I>effect ends. The priest can issue only one <I>mass suggestion </I>per use of the divine voice skill.
<P></P>
Each use of this skill reduces the priest’s base eminence score by two for one
week. If the priest’s eminence score is zero or less, the divine voice skill
is ineffective.

of will and resist any form of compulsion imposed upon them.
<P></P>
When subjected to any form of unnatural compulsion from a spell, creature, or
magical item, a priest can roll a skill check. If the check succeeds, the
effect is negated, and no saving throw is necessary. If the check fails, the priest
still gets a saving throw if one is normally allowed.
<P></P>
Divine will is effective against any effect that causes the priest to act
according to another creature’s will, including all forms of <I>charm, geas, quest, fear, magic jar </I>(the invading psyche is ejected), <I>beguiling, command</I>, etc.
<P></P>
Each use of this skill, successful or not reduces the priest’s base eminence
score by two for one day. This skill is ineffective when the character’s
eminence score has been reduced to zero or less.

<P></P>
A successful skill roll allows the priest to uncover any falsehoods the
character encounters, be it a false image from an illusion or a false statement from
another creature. This skill lasts for a short time, detailed on the table
below:

<P></P>
<P></P>
If the skill check is unsuccessful, the priest is aware of the failure and
must wait one turn to try the skill again. If the skill check succeeds, the priest
detects all forms of spoken falsehoods automatically for the duration of the
skill’s effect. Unlike a <I>detect lie </I>spell, the priest knows when a creature is deliberately evading the truth. The
skill does not tell the priest what the truth is, it only reveals that fact
that the priest has heard a lie or evasion. If the priest encounters magic that
allows falsehoods to be spoken, the priest is unable to hear the magically
protected creature speak; this reveals the falsehood indirectly.
<P></P>
While the skill is in effect, the priest also gains an immediate saving throw
vs. spell to see through any false vision or visual distortion created by a
spell, magical item, or creature. The DM should make the roll secretly. If
successful, the priest sees the false image as a fine, semi-transparent mist. This
power works against all forms of false and misleading images, including <I>mirror image, blur, shadow door, phantasmal force</I>, and other spells that mislead or visually confuse viewers. Illusion spells
that do not create an image, such as <I>invisibility</I>, are not affected. The power also defeats <I>cloaks of displacement, robes of blending, </I>and similar magical items. The skill has no power against effects that
disguise things through physical changes, such as <I>polymorph self </I>or <I>shape change.</I>
<P></P>
Each use of this skill, successful or not, lowers the priest’s base eminence
score by two for one week. If the priest’s base eminence score falls to zero or
less, this skill is ineffective.

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Eminence: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This skill allows priests to wrap themselves in an aura of divine power.
<P></P>
A successful check creates an aura that lasts one round for each level the
caster has attained. The aura is undetectable except by a <I>true seeing </I>spell, which reveals it as a bright silver, inky black, or pearl gray halo
depending on the priest’s alignment. The aura gives the priest a +4 encounter
reaction bonus when dealing with worshippers of the priest’s deity or creatures of
the same alignment.
<P></P>
Any hostile creature feels a shudder of fear when within 30 feet of the
priest. If the priest wills it, the fear takes hold, causing creatures of less than
4th level or 4 Hit Dice to flee until the priest is no longer in sight. More
powerful creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to negate the fear. The
skill works against all types of creatures—even those normally immune to fear
attacks, such as undead. A <I>cloak of bravery </I>or <I>remove fear </I>spell breaks the effect, as does a successful use of the warrior skill bravery
or the priest skill divine will. Once a creature has resisted the fear effect
once, it is not subject to fear effects from the same priest for the rest of
the day.
<P></P>
Creatures within 30 feet of an opposing priest using the eminence skill are
not subject to the fear effect if the second priest’s level is equal to or higher
than the priest using the fear effect.
<P></P>
Each attempt to raise the aura, successful or not, reduces the priest’s base
eminence score by two for one week. When the character’s base eminence score is
reduced to zero or less, the skill is ineffective.
<P></P>
The eminence skill is a prerequisite for the divine strength, divine voice,
divine will, detect deception, and invincibility skills. Each time one of these
skills are used, the character’s base eminence score is reduced by two for
either one day or one week, depending on the skill used. Once the priest’s base
eminence score falls to zero, the character cannot use eminence or any of the other
skills. The smite skill is also connected to the priest’s eminence score, but
can be used (at some risk to the priest) when the eminence skill has been
reduced to zero or less, see <A HREF="DD01377.htm#dbd354ad"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01377.htm#dbd354ad">page 167</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">.

Invincibility: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Priests with this skill can draw upon divine power to temporarily delay the
harmful effects of special attacks, but not physical damage. If given sufficient
time to rest, this skill allows priests to recover from such attacks without
additional aid. It is very similar to the warrior skill hardiness
<P></P>
When subjected to a harmful special effect from a spell, creature, or magical
item, a priest can roll a skill check. If the check succeeds, the effect is
delayed for the period of time shown on the table below. If the check fails, the
priest suffers the effect normally. If the effect allows a saving throw, the
priest rolls the save before checking this skill.

<P></P>
Invincibility does not delay simple damage from any source, including
continuing damage, such as <I>Melf’s acid arrow </I>or a <I>sword of wounding</I>, or special forms of purely physical damage, such as severed limbs or broken
bones. This skill does not protect against effects that are not directly
harmful, such as magical charms, entanglement, or imprisonment.
<P></P>
If the skill succeeds, the priest suffers no harm from the delayed effect
until the delay ends, but he is aware of what the effect is. If the priest receives
the appropriate cure before the delay ends, there is no harm to the character.
If the harmful effect’s duration is shorter than the delay there also is no
effect.
<P></P>
For example, a 25th-level priest with 52 hit points left (from a total of 107)
is battling a wizard who casts <I>power word kill </I>on him. After making his invincibility skill roll, he delays the effects of
the spell for 10 rounds. Four rounds later, after killing the wizard, he casts
heal on himself. When the delay effect is over, the power word kill effect
occurs, but his hit points are now over 60 and he is immune to the spell. If he had
not healed himself, he could have lapsed into unconsciousness in an effort to
avoid the effect of the power word, as detailed below.
<P></P>
If the harmful effect has not expired or been cured when the delay ends, the
priest must either suffer the full force of the effect or lapse into
unconsciousness while the character’s body struggles to resist. The length of time the
character remains unconsciousness depends on the extent of the injury, as noted on
the table below.

<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Minor: </I>These effects impair—but do not incapacitate—the character, such as blindness,
deafness, and ability score reductions. Spells such as <I>antipathy/sympathy </I>(antipathy effect), <I>cause blindness/deafness, color spray </I>(most of the time), <I>contagion, </I>and <I>holy word </I>are examples of minor effects.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Severe: </I>Includes effects that incapacitate or completely transform the character, such
as petrification, polymorphing, and death. Severe spell effects include <I>hold person, phantasmal killer, polymorph other, power word kill, </I>and <I>power word stun</I>.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Extreme: </I>Includes effects that wrench the character’s very being, such as <I>energy drains </I>(per level drained) and magical aging (per year aged). Two notable examples
include the 9th-level wizard spell <I>energy drain </I>and the 6th-level priest spell age creature from the <A HREF="TM_DD04363.htm#1095fb05"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="TM_DD04363.htm#1095fb05">Tome of Magic</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
<P></P>
At the end of the recovery time, the character attempts a system shock roll.
If the roll succeeds, the character awakens—fully healed—and the effects of the
delayed magic are nullified. If the roll fails, the character awakens, but
suffers the full force of the effect. Thus, it is possible for a character to rest
for months and then wake up only to die from the effects of the delayed magic.
<P></P>
For instance, if our priest from the above example had decided to sleep off
the effects of the <I>power word kill</I>, he would have been unconscious for a week. The player rolls the character’s
system shock roll (15 Constitution) and rolls 96%—6% over what he needed. Since
the power word would have killed him at the time he lapsed into
unconsciousness, the character awakens just long enough to be killed by the spell.
<P></P>
If a character is suffering from multiple effects, the character makes system
shock rolls at the end of each recovery period. The player can choose the order
in which the checks are made, but the character does not awaken until checks
have been made for all the effects. For example, a character who was drained by
a vampire and paralyzed by a lich remains unconscious for nine weeks—one month
to revive from each of the two levels the vampire drained and another week for
the paralysis.
<P></P>
If an appropriate cure is applied while the character is unconscious, the
character recovers immediately and automatically.
<P></P>
<I>Heroic Effort: </I>As a last-ditch effort to continue a battle, a priest can use the
invincibility skill to extend his life. Instead of dying at zero hit points (or falling
unconscious at zero hit points and dying at –10 if the optional <I>Hovering at Death’s Door </I>rule is in play), a priest who makes a successful invincibility check can
continue fighting until reaching –20 hit points. The character can function in this
state for a number of rounds equal to his delay effect, suffering the
appropriate consequences for reduced hit points at the end of the delay.
<P></P>
Use of this skill is not without its drawbacks, however. If the priest is
reduced to –20 hit points or less, the character is struck unconscious and dies
once the delay expires. Once a character’s hit points drop to –20 or less, death
is inevitable at the end of the delay period unless unusual conditions exist
(see below).
<P></P>
Curative spells can allow a priest struck unconscious by being reduced –20 hit
points or less to rejoin a battle, but death still occurs at the end of the
delay period. A <I>raise dead </I>or <I>resurrection </I>spell cast during the delay period prevents death from occurring.
<P></P>
It is possible that a character with the ability to regenerate (from a magical
item or high Constitution score) can continue fighting even after being
reduced to –20 hit points or less. If regeneration increases the priest’s hit points
to –19 or more during the delay period, the character regains consciousness and
does not die if he receives enough healing to restore him to positive hit
points before the delay ends. Even if death occurs, regeneration usually restores a
character much more quickly than the rest period the invincibility skill
requires. A character returned to life through regeneration need not make a system
shock roll.
<P></P>
An <I>amulet of life protection </I>also allows a priest to continue fighting after being reduced to –20 hit
points or less if the character receives sufficient healing to restore him to –19
hit points or more. The character still lapses back into death at the end of the
delay period, but any form of magical healing can restore him to life (see <A HREF="DD01280.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01280.htm">page 79</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">) and no system shock roll is required.
<P></P>
Each use of the invincibility skill lowers the priest’s base eminence score by
two for the rest of the day. The skill is ineffective if the character’s base
eminence score is reduced to zero or less.

With a successful skill roll, the priest transfers a small amount of his own

hit points from an unwilling donor, an attack roll is required before the
character can make the skill roll. The number of hit points that are transferred

Transferred hit points are immediately subtracted from the donor’s hit point
total and added to the recipient’s total. The hit points are lost to the donor,
just as though the donor was subjected to a damaging attack. Donated hit points
can be restored through rest or magical healing just as any other form of
damage. If the donor has insufficient hit points to supply the transfer, only those
available are transferred and the donor dies. Transferred hit points remain
with the recipient for 24 hours or until lost in an attack.

The priest has no control over the precise effect of the smiting, which the DM
chooses from the list below. No matter what the effect, only the priest’s
enemies are harmed. Allies, innocent bystanders, and worshippers in good standing
with the priest’s deity are not affected.
<P></P>
<I>Awestruck: </I>This is the default effect when the deity does not feel the targets are
offensive or threatening. It also is granted when the deity feels that a simple
demonstration of its power is sufficient to handle the situation.
<P></P>
A two-dimensional depiction of the deity or the deity’s symbol appears in
front of the priest, causing the priest’s enemies to stare at it in awe if they are
within the cone. Creatures with more than 10 Hit Dice or levels are allowed a
saving throw vs. spell. Even if the save succeeds, creatures are awestruck for
one round, regardless of personal immunities granted by spell or high ability
scores.
<P></P>
Creatures remain awestruck only as long as the priest remains motionless and
concentrates on the effect, but no longer than one round per level of the
priest, plus 1d8 rounds, in any case. Enemies who enter the cone after the image
appears are fully subject to the awe effect, even if they avert their eyes. Any
motion or the slightest break in the priest’s concentration ends the effect, as
does any offensive action by the priest’s allies. Distractions to the awestruck
characters also end the effect. Loud noises, magical displays, attacks, or
attempts to steal the awestruck creatures’ equipment, damage their property, or
otherwise cause them harm are sufficient to break the effect.
<P></P>
<I>Blinded: </I>Deities grant this effect when they find the target creatures offensive, but
not particularly dangerous.
<P></P>
Only creatures with 12 or more levels or Hit Dice are allowed a saving throw
vs. breath weapon to avoid the effect.
<P></P>
Blinded creatures move at 2/3 the normal rate and suffer a –4 penalty to
attack rolls, saving throws, initiative rolls, and ability checks. Blinded
spellcasters cannot cast spells unless they can touch their targets. Blindness lasts
until the victim receives a <I>heal </I>or <I>cure blindness or deafness </I>spell.
<P></P>
<I>Burned: </I>This effect is granted when the targets are violent and pose an immediate
physical threat to the priest, a sacred site, or to creatures friendly toward the
priest. The cone fills with a mass of heatless flames that burn the priest’s
enemies for 6d8 points of damage, save vs. breath weapon for half. Creatures
killed by the flames are reduced to piles of ash and no regeneration is possible.
Though the heatless flames do not harm the area, they can affect the target’s
equipment. If a target creature fails the breath weapon saving throw or is killed
by the flames, any equipment the creature carries must save vs. disintegration
or be reduced to dust.
<P></P>
<I>Deafened: </I>This effect occurs when the targets have not greatly offended the deity or
when the priest is not in significant peril. Only creatures with 12 or more levels
or Hit Dice are allowed a saving throw vs. breath weapon to avoid the effect.
<P></P>
Deafened creatures move at 3/4 the normal rate and suffer a –2 penalty to
attack rolls, initiative rolls, and ability checks. There is a 50% chance that any
spell a deafened spellcaster attempts fails outright. Deafness lasts until the
victim receives a <I>heal </I>or <I>cure blindness or deafness </I>spell.
<P></P>
<I>Death: </I>Deities grant this effect only when deeply offended or when the priest is in
extreme danger. Enemies within the cone are immediately reduced to dust if they
have 4 Hit Dice/levels or less. Other enemies suffer a doubled burning effect
(12d8 points of damage, save vs. spells for half damage).
<P></P>
<I>Immobilized: </I>Deities commonly grant this effect when the targets are genuinely dangerous or
offensive. Creatures of 6+1 Hit Dice/levels or less are automatically
paralyzed, their flesh turning into a rigid, crystalline substance that is easily
shattered. Other creatures are allowed a save vs. petrification to negate the
effect. The immobility lasts 1d4+2 turns. <I>Free action </I>is useless against this effect.
<P></P>
Immobilized creatures can be killed by striking their crystalline bodies with
any hard object. For each strike, the creature must make a saving throw as rock
crystal versus crushing blow. Only bonuses granted from magical rings, cloaks,
and armor count toward the saving throw. Failure results in death.
<P></P>
<I>Plagued: </I>The deity grants this effect when the targets are offensive, but do not pose
any danger to the deity’s interests. The priest’s enemies are affected as if
struck by a <I>cause disease </I>spell. The disease inflicted is debilitating (see the reversed form of the
3rd-level priest spell <A HREF="PHB_DD02178.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD02178.htm">cure disease</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">) and causes the victim to radiate a foul stench. The disease is neither
contagious nor fatal. It can be cured by a <I>cure disease </I>or <I>breath of life </I>spell from a caster of higher level that the priest who called down the plague.
<P></P>
<I>Slowed: </I>This effect is granted when deity is offended, but the enemies pose no
immediate threat to a sacred site, the priest, or creatures friendly toward the priest
or the deity. The effect is the same as the 3rd level wizard spell <I>slow</I>, except that creatures with less than 8+1 Hit Dice or levels get no saving
throw. The slow effect lasts for 1d4+2 turns.
<P></P>
Each use of this ability reduces the base score for the priest’s eminence
skill by two for one week. As long the priest has a positive eminence score, the
priest need not make a skill roll to smite enemies. If the priest’s base eminence
skill score is zero or less, however, the priest must roll an eminence check
to successfully smite enemies. Note that this is possible only if the priest has
a Charisma/Leadership bonus large enough to offset a negative base score. If
the roll fails, the deity is displeased. At best, no smite effect occurs, at
worst, the deity directs a smite effect upon the priest.
<P></P>
An example: Marissa has an eminence score of 4 and a Charisma/Leadership bonus
of +4. She can freely smite enemies twice a week as long as her eminence base
score is not reduced by using other skills. During an adventure, she uses her
smite skill once and the divine voice skill once. This reduces her eminence
skill to zero. If she wishes to use her smite skill again, she must roll a 4 or
less on 1d20 to succeed.
<P></P>
Undaunted, Marissa smites a group of passing kobolds she has come upon. Her
1d20 roll is a 3, so the smite works. Marissa’s deity isn’t too worried about the
kobolds, who were minding their own business when Marissa came along, and
grants Marissa an awe effect. The kobolds are briefly entranced, but a fighter from
Marissa’s party wades into the kobolds, making an all-round attack. The attack
breaks the awe effect.
<P></P>
Feeling threatened by the swarm of kobolds, Marissa foolishly tries to smite
them again. Her base eminence score is now a –2, but her Charisma/Leadership
bonus increases that to a 2. Melissa rolls an 18 and fails. The deity is getting a
little tired of all Melissa’s attempts to call for special aid and bestows a
deafness effect on her. Fortunately, her saving throw succeeds. Marissa’s base
eminence score is now a –4, leaving her no chance to smite the kobolds again
even if she was silly enough to try it again.

<P></P>
When a priest with this skill is finished praying for spells, the character
can attempt to cast the spell and direct its magical energy into a special
container or talisman. A talisman is a small object such as a jewel, crystal bead, or
holy symbol blessed by the priest. A talisman must be worth at least 100 gp
per spell level.
<P></P>
A successful skill roll is required to place a spell into a talisman. If the
roll fails, the spell is wasted. The priest must have all necessary material
components on hand and must meet all the usual requirements to cast a spell. If
casting the spell has an effect on the priest, such as unnatural aging, the
priest suffers the effect even if the spell was not placed in the talisman.

The total levels of spells a priest can have stored in talismans cannot exceed

For example, Wulf, a 21st-level priest, can have up to 21 levels of spells
stored, but no stored spell can be higher than 4th level. Wulf might choose to
store two spells of 4th level, two 3rd, and seven 1st-level spells.
<P></P>
To release a spell from a talisman, the priest must be holding or carrying the
item and have the opportunity to concentrate briefly and utter a few words.
Though the initiative modifier for releasing the spell is +2, the release cannot
be disrupted (though a gagged or silenced priest could not release the spell).
Once the spell is released, it functions as if cast normally in all respects,
destroying the talisman in the process.
<P></P>
A spell can be stored in a talisman for a maximum of 24 hours. If not used in
the allotted time, or if separated from the priest for more than one hour, the
talisman crumbles into dust and the spell is lost. No being other than the
priest who stored the spell can release the stored energy.
<P></P>
A portion of the spell stored in a talisman lingers in the priest’s memory. If
the priest memorizes spells again before the 24 hours have expired, the
character cannot regain the spell stored in the talisman. The priest cannot transfer
a spell from a talisman back into memory. If a talisman is destroyed, the spell
is lost. A spell fades from the priest’s memory when it is released or lost.
<P></P>
Spells stored in talismans can be cast on worlds where the local magical
factor would not allow the spell to be cast (see <A HREF="DD01231.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01231.htm">Chapter 2</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">). A spell cannot be stored in talisman, however, unless the local conditions
