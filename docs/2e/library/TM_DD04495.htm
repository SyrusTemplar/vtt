<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Mirror of Simple Order: </B>When a character steps in front of this mirror, he sees a strangely distorted
image of himself. The reflection moves as he does, but the face reflected in
the mirror is the image of an ordinary face. There are eyes, a mouth, and a nose,
but all lack character. Although the figure moves as the character does, it is
shorter or taller than he is, adjusted in whatever direction approaches the
average height of the character's race. Any clothing worn by the character is
altered as well. Bright colors will be muted, appearing to be shades of grey. Any
ornamental work on armor, weapons, or clothing will be gone.
<P></P>
If the character stands in front of the mirror for more than two rounds, he is
instantly <I>polymorphed</I> into the image in the mirror. The <I>polymorphed</I> character must succeed on a system shock roll to survive the change.
<P></P>
Like the <I>polymorph other</I> spell, there is a chance that the subject's personality and mentality change
into that of the new form. In this case, each of his ability scores becomes 11
and his hit points become the average for his Hit Dice at his level. He retains
his level and class, but is not as exceptional as he might have been. He is
bland and boring. The character's alignment changes to lawful neutral, and he
becomes interested in little else other than setting order to the world. He
passionlessly travels to wipe out chaos wherever he finds it.
<P></P>
All effects of the mirror can be removed through a <I>dispel magic</I> spell. Until the effects are removed, however, the character is unaware that
any change has occurred.
