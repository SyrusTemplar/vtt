Sapping someone—i.e., hitting him over the head in order to knock him out—is a
maneuver you undertake when you wish to capture an enemy alive (or just
incapacitate him without killing him).
<P></P>
To do this, the attacking character makes a Called Shot at an additional –4 to
attack rolls (so it's –8 total, plus the usual Called Shot penalties of having
to announce your maneuver before initiative and suffering a +1 to initiative).
<P></P>
If the attack hits, the character rolls ordinary damage for the weapon. He
gets a 5% chance of knockout (as per the Punching and Wrestling rules) for every
point of damage he does, up to a maximum of 40%.
<P></P>
<I>Example: Sir Amstard wants to knock out a noble opponent rather than kill him.
He attacks to Sap the opponent. Luckily, even with the –8 to attack rolls, he
successfully hits his foe. With his sword, he rolls 6 points of damage. This
gives him a (6x5%) 30% chance of an instant knockout. On his percentile dice, he
rolls 42; he has failed this time. He'll try again.
<P></P>
</I> The damage done by Sap attacks is the same as that done by Punching; in other
words, only 25% is normal, or &quot;permanent,&quot; damage. The other 75% is temporary,
and wears off after a short while, as we'll discuss later in this chapter.
<P></P>
When using a special or magical weapon to perform the Sap,<I> you do not count the weapon's attack or damage bonus. </I>You're not using the weapon the way it is meant to be used; you're hitting
your target with the flat of the blade, with the hilt or pommel of the weapon,
etc. Therefore, those bonuses don't count for anything.
<P></P>
When performed on a character who is asleep or magically held, the Sap
maneuver automatically hits. The chance for knockout goes up to 10% per point of
damage done, up to 80%. However, if the subsequent percentile die-roll is 81 or
higher, the victim is not knocked out—he's been awakened by the attack. (Why try a
Sap maneuver on an already-asleep target? Because you may want to kidnap him or
smuggling him out of a cell and can't risk him waking up and alerting the
guards.)
<P></P>
The Sap maneuver can only be performed with melee weapons or bare hands; it
cannot be performed with missile weapons.
<P></P>
The Sap maneuver is usable only on Small (S) or Medium (M) monsters; it will
not work on Large (L) or bigger monsters such as dragons. They just can't be
knocked out with this maneuver.
