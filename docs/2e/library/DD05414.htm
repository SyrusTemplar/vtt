According to the <I>PH</I>, only humans can be paladins. But, using the rules in this book, a DM may
allow paladin-like characters of other races in an AD&amp;D? campaign. Lacking the
necessary qualities to become paladins in the truest sense, these other races are
subject to specific limitations and are known as demipaladins.
<P></P>
A demipaladin is a fighter/cleric who gains paladin-like powers from his deity
after completing special quests for his church. A demipaladin may be a dwarf,
gnome, elf, half-elf, or halfling. Any character desiring to become a
demipaladin must be lawful good from the character's generation and have all the
ability-score requirements of paladins. The character is allowed to gain a 10% bonus
on experience in his fighter or cleric class if his Strength or Wisdom score
(respectively) is 16 or better (Charisma, of course, must be 17 or better). The
character must also adhere to all ethos requirements, such as strictures, edicts,
and so on, from the start of play.
<P></P>
The character attacks as per his fighter level, makes saving throws as either
a fighter or cleric (whichever class produces the better score), and gains
weapon and nonweapon proficiency slots for both of his classes as he gains levels.
Experience is divided between the fighter and cleric classes as per the usual
rules. Cleric spells are gained as normal, though the spells the demipaladin may
use are restricted to those listed in this supplement. A demipaladin turns
undead as per his cleric level. The level limits for demihuman fighter and cleric
classes are as given in the <I>DMG</I>, pages 14-15 (see <A HREF="DMG_DD00223.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00223.htm">Table 7</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> therein), so a demipaladin has definite disadvantages at higher levels
compared to a human paladin.
<P></P>
Each demipaladin must take a kit as described in this text. The DM should rule
on the appropriateness of each kit to the campaign setting and available
equipment and mounts (e.g., a halfling could be a skyrider if a very small pegasus
is found, but not a wyrmslayer if no dragons are in the area). New kits, as
noted later, may be created and taken.
<P></P>
The power-gaining quests given to the demipaladin must be undertaken
immediately whenever the character gains the ability to cast spells from a clerical
level above the first-e.g., at 3rd level when second-level spells are gained, at
5th level when third-level spells are gained, etc. The nature of each quest must
be determined by the DM, but each should be challenging and full of peril. Some
quests may require the demipaladin to complete the tasks unaided or else
assume a major leadership or combat role if helped by other adventuring companions.
Such companions must be lawful good, though not necessarily of the
demipaladin's race and religion.
<P></P>
If a quest is successfully completed, the demipaladin gains a single
paladin-like power of the DM's choice, taken from the following: ability to use paladin
magical items (such as <I>holy swords</I>); detection of evil intent; +2 saving-throw bonus; immunity to disease;
ability to cure disease; ability to lay on hands; aura of protection; bonded mount.
Racial level limits will restrict the number of special powers gained; e.g.,
halfling demipaladins, who can achieve only the 8th level of ability as clerics,
would thus gain only three such special powers (at 3rd, 5th, and 7th levels).
<P></P>
New demipaladin kits, specifically tailored to the natures of demihumans, may
be designed. Some suggestions include:
<P></P>
<B>Elven Trooper:</B> A mounted guardsman, the trooper accompanies elven royalty on fairy
rides-solemn processions made through elven territory-as well as patrolling the
kingdom's boundaries by himself or undertaking royal quests.
<P></P>
<B>Half-Elven Herald:</B> This is the official messenger of a human or elven government (often to a
country of the other race), usually delivering documents to dignitaries, issuing
public decrees, and locating recruits for royal quests.
<P></P>
<B>Halfling Sheriff:</B> The sheriff is a law-enforcement agent with authority to make arrests, pass
sentences, and otherwise ensure the safety of a halfling settlement.
<P></P>
<B> Dwarven Forgelighter:</B> A forgelighter devotes his life to taking back dwarven kingdoms and cities
that were lost to other races (e.g., humans, orcs, derro, etc.) by warfare or
treachery, re-establishing the colonies and defending them until they are
self-sustaining again.
