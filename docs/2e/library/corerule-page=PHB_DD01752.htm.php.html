Hidden out there in the campaign world are great treasures awaiting discovery.
Ancient dragons rest on huge hordes of gold, silver, and gems. Orc chieftains
greedily garner the loot from the latest raid. Mindless jellies ooze through
the bones and armor of unfortunate souls. Foul lords of darkness cunningly leave
small fortunes apparently unguarded, like spiders luring in the flies. Stooped
wizards assemble shelves of arcane magical items. Some treasures, like those of
dragons, are gathered and horded for reasons fully understood only by their
collectors. Others are gathered for more mundane purposes--power, luxury, and
security. A rare few troves date from eons before, their owners long dead and
forgotten. Some treasure hordes are small, such as the pickings of a yellow mold.
Others are enormous, such as the Tyrant King's treasury. Treasures may be free
for the taking or fiercely trapped and watched over.
