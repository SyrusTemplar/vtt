They weigh
between 200 and 250 pounds, and their hides are covered with tough scales of
dark green to brown. Lizard men have long, dangerous claws and thick, powerful
tails up to four feet in length. They are exceptional swimmers and can hold their
breath twice as long as most other air-breathing creatures, but they are slow
and somewhat clumsy on land.

Generally, lizard men are dim savages who have not even mastered the use of
the most basic tools and weapons, but PC lizard men are members of a more
advanced variety that is capable of using weapons and armor. Despite this, lizard men
are barbarians by any definition of the word, and human society and behavior is
baffling to them. Unlike some other barbarians, lizard men are likely to react
to this with violence instead of curiosity.
