<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Most of the item descriptions below are complete in and of themselves. A few
categories of magical items require some general comments, however:
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Artifacts and Relics:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">These are not listed here. They are the DM's province. Advice on the creation
and use of artifacts and relics can be found beginning in <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD00511.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD00511.htm.php.html">Chapter 10</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> .
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Books:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">All magical books, librams, manuals, tomes, etc. appear to be &quot;normal'' works
of arcane lore. Each is indistinguishable from all others by visual examination
of the outer parts or by detection for magic aura.
<P></P>
A <I>wish</I> spell can identify or classify a magical work. Other spells, notably <I>commune, contact higher planes, limited wish,</I> and <I>true seeing</I> are useless. A <I>wish</I> reveals the general contents of a book, telling what classes or
characteristics are most affected (not necessarily benefitted) by the work. A second <I>wish</I> is required to determine the book's exact contents.
<P></P>
After being perused by a character, most magical works vanish forever, but one
which is nonbeneficial to the reader may be attached to the character, and he
will be unable to rid himself of it. If the work benefits another character
alignment, the possessor is <I>geased</I> to conceal and guard it. As DM you should use your judgment and imagination
as to exactly how these items will be treated, using the rules in this section
as parameters.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Boots:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">All magical boots expand or shrink to fit the wearer, from halfling to giant
size.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Eyes:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mixing eye types is certain to cause immediate insanity for 2d4 turns. Once
this time has passed the character can (and should) remove one of the magical
lenses!
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ropes:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Any magical rope which is broken or severed immediately loses its special
properties.
<P></P>
Note that though the miscellaneous magical items are broken into categories on
the tables for the purpose of random selection, all items are alphabetized
together in the following descriptions.
