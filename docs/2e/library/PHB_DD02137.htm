The caster can find the direction and distance of any one type of animal or
plant he desires. The caster, facing in a direction, thinks of the animal or
plant, and then knows if any such animal or plant is within range. If so, the exact
distance and approximate number present is learned. During each round of the
spell's duration, the caster can face in only one direction (i.e., only a
20-foot-wide path can be known). The spell lasts one round per level of experience of
the caster, while the length of the path is 100 yards plus 20 yards per level
of experience. (At the DM's option, some casters may be able to locate only
those animals [or plants] associated closely with their own mythos.)
<P></P>
While the exact chance of locating a specific type of animal or plant depends
on the details and circumstances of the locale, the general frequency of the
subject can be used as a guideline: common = 50%, uncommon = 30%, rare = 15%, and
very rare = 5%. Most herbs grow in temperate regions, while most spices grow
in tropical regions. Most plants sought as spell components or for magical
research are rare or very rare. The results of this spell are always determined by
the DM.

The material component is the caster's holy symbol.
