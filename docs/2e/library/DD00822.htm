<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Rod of Flailing:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This magical weapon radiates faintly of alteration magic when subjected to a <I>detect magic</I> spell. Upon the command of its possessor, the weapon activates, changing from
a normal-seeming rod to a double-headed flail. In close quarters, or if the
wielder is mounted, it is the small, horseman's weapon (base damage 1d4+1,
S-M/L); otherwise, it is a footman's weapon (base damage 1d6+1/2d4, S-M/L).
<P></P>
In either form, the weapon has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls. Each of
the weapon's two heads can be used to attack, so double hits can be scored,
either on a single opponent or on two opponents who are man-sized or smaller and
standing side by side.
<P></P>
If the holder of the rod expends one charge, he gains +4 bonuses on Armor
Class and saving throws for one turn. The rod need not be in weapon-form for this
protection benefit to be employed. Transforming it into a weapon (or back into a
rod) does not expend any charges.
