<I>&quot;I could tell that they feared me when I came into their village and demanded
a place to sleep for the night. Gave me a nice room, they did, too.
<P></P>
&quot;But when I woke up, everything I had in my pockets, my pouches--even my wand
and the rings from my fingers--all were gone! Only my spellbook was
left--though how they knew about the runes I'd put on it to fry anyone who touched it
besides me I'll never know.
<P></P>
&quot;I spent the whole morning negotiating for most of my equipment back. Then,
when I would have turned to whole nest of them into an anthill, something made me
think the better of it. A couple of them might have stuck me with arrows
before I could finish the spell--not a pleasant prospect.
<P></P>
&quot;So I left, and brother, let me tell you it'll be a long time before I subject
myself to halfling hospitality again!&quot;

Sorcery is one area of power where halfling skills are lacking. Their inherent
resistance to magic protects them against many of the power-crazed
spellcasters in the world, but it also prevents them from mastering those forces for
themselves: no halfling has learned much about the wielding of arcane power
(although comic tales about bumbling but well-intentioned halfling apprentices are
popular in many places). Unlike many humans and dwarves, they do not regard magic
as particularly threatening; trust in their innate resistance enables halflings
to extend to spellcasters the typically friendly greeting they give to all
strangers--a fact which no doubt explains the fondness some wizards have for the
race.
