<P></P>
This god delights in trickery for trickery's sake. He loves fooling people,
animals, other gods # to show them how much more clever he is, just to see the
looks on their faces, for just about any reason.
<P></P>
Naturally, this god is the favorite of rogues, especially thieves. But don't
think that he's a god of cowards: To pull off the best tricks and plots, his
followers must be brave indeed. However, many cowardly rogues do worship this god
anyway, in admiration of his ability to get out of rough spots without
resorting to combat.
<P></P>
His priests, in addition to extolling this god's virtues, also love
demonstrating cleverness. Some perform harmless pranks for comic relief. Others become
polished military tacticians for armies. Others learn nonweapon proficiencies
that let them become proficient trapsters or stage magicians.
<P></P>
To be a priest of this god, a character does not have to be nasty or mean to
others. The priest might demonstrate his cleverness through sleight of hand or
by executing clever plots that straighten out problems rather than cause them.
On the other hand, some priests of this god are just sly troublemakers who
create problems for everyone. That's a choice left to the player of this type of
priest.
<P></P>
The god of mischief is male.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Fortune/Luck,
Messengers, Race (Gnome), Race (Halfling), Trade, War, and Wisdom. Priests of
this god are sometimes allies of the priests of the philosophy of Evil; this
decision is up to the DM, based on how he perceives his campaign world. The priests
of this god dislike the priests of Strength.
