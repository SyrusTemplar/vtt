<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cloak of the Bat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Fashioned of dark brown or black cloth, a cloak of this type is not readily
noticeable as unusual. It radiates both enchantment and alteration in equal
proportions. The cloak bestows a 90% probability of being invisible when the wearer
is stationary within a shadowy or dark place. The wearer is also able to hang
upside down from the ceiling, like a bat, and to maintain this same chance of
invisibility.
<P></P>
By holding the edges of the garment, the wearer is able to fly at a speed of
15 (Maneuver Class: B). If he desires, the wearer can actually transform himself
into an ordinary bat—all possessions worn or carried will be part of the
transformation—and fly accordingly. Flying, either with the cloak or as an ordinary
bat, can be accomplished only in darkness (either under the night sky or in a
lightless or near-lightless environment underground). Either of the flying
powers is usable for up to one hour at a time, but after a flight of any duration,
the cloak will not bestow any flying power for a like period of time.
<P></P>
The cloak also provides a +2 bonus to Armor Class. This benefit extends to the
wearer even when he is in bat form.
