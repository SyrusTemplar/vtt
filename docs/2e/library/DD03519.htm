Channellers
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Imagine wizards who do <I>not </I>forget spells as they are cast, but instead freely use any spell in their
repertoire whenever they wish. Wizards in this system of magic are born with some
special spark or gift that allows them to reach some hidden source or supply of
magical energy and use this to power their enchantments and spells. A young
apprentice knows only one or two ways to harness this energy into useful
applications and has a very limited capacity for tapping and shaping magical energy,
while a great archmage knows dozens upon dozens of spells and has a nearly
unlimited capability for wielding magical energy.
<P></P>
While this may seem like a world where the wizards reign unchecked, there-s an
important catch: Reaching for and directing magical energy is a dangerous and
taxing exercise, at least as difficult as heavy labor or prolonged exertion,
and each spell a wizard casts leaves him weakened and vulnerable. In fact,
wizards can exhaust their very lives by casting a spell that-s too much for them to
handle or by casting too many smaller spells in succession.
<P></P>
Channelling or summoning magical energy is a very common system of magic in
fantasy literature. Here-s how it works in the Player's Option rules: Basically,
the wizard gains <A HREF="DD03507.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03507.htm">spell points</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> as described in the beginning of this chapter, allocates them to fixed
magicks or free magicks just as he wishes, and selects the particular spells he wants
to have locked into memory as fixed magicks. (Since the wizard takes the time
to impress these spells in his mind, it-s easier for him to energize them with
channelled magic, and thus the spell point cost is lower than free magicks.)
The following optional systems from the previous section are used:
<P></P>
<P></P>
Free magicks may be used to provide the wizard with access to any spell in his
repertoire, although they-re still more expensive than fixed magicks.
<P></P>
The wizard may exceed his normal spell level limit using the optional rules
described previously.
<P></P>
The wizard may decide to cast spells for greater effect by simply spending
more spell points when he actually casts the spell.
<P></P>
The wizard can save spell points by choosing to cast spells with a prolonged
casting time or at reduced power.
<P></P>
Lastly, the wizard modifies his spell point total based on his Wisdom and
Constitution scores; he may not gain bonus spell points for his Intelligence. The
character-s hit point adjustment for Constitution and his magical attack
adjustment for Wisdom are added to or subtracted from his spell point total. If this
lowers a 1st-level character to less than 4 spell points, he ignores the
adjustments; all wizards have at least 4 spell points.
<P></P>
<P></P>
While the character may have some spell points -allocated? or -tied up? in
various fixed and free magicks, this actually makes no difference for a
channeller. The initial selection of spells is simply used to create a slate of spell
powers that the character can access and to define the cost in spell points for
making use of these powers. The character may cast any spell that he has
available through either a fixed or free magick, except that the magick does not vanish
from his memory once he-s cast the spell. Instead, the character deducts the
number of spell points required to energize the spell from his spell point
total. For example, if a mage with 40 spell points has a magic missile memorized, he
can cast that magic missile four times if he wants to!

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><B>Channellers and Studying Spells: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Since spells never vanish from a channeller-s memory, the character does not
normally re-memorize spells during the course of an adventure. However,
channellers have no particular obstacles to learning new spells or replacing the spells
held as fixed or free magicks in their memory. The character must be
well-rested and have access to his spell books. It takes 10 minutes per spell level for
the character to memorize a new spell. In effect, he -overwrites? whichever
spells he wishes to in order to change the allocation of spell points into free
and fixed magicks.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I> Kerian, a 5th-level channelling invoker, wishes to change the spells he has
memorized. Because of his Constitution bonus, he has 61 points to assign to
various magicks. After resting, he decides to memorize one fixed (</I>shield<I>) and one free 1st-level magick (12 SPs), two fixed magicks (</I>web <I>and </I>invisibility <I>for 12 SPs), and one prolonged casting time 3rd-level magick (</I>fireball<I> for 7 SPs), and one 4th-level magick that exceeds his level (</I>ice storm <I>at 30 SPs). After memorizing the spells, which takes 1 hour and 10 minutes,
Kerian is ready to adventure!
<P></P>
</I>
<P></P>
If a character wishes to change just one spell in his current repertoire, he
still has to rest and memorize it. For example, if a mage wished to change his <I>magic missile </I>spell to a <I>shield </I>spell, then he would have to sleep for eight hours and spend 10 minutes
committing it to memory.
<P></P>
Since spell points in this system represent magic potential or stamina (for
lack of better words), expended spell points are naturally recovered as the
character-s fatigue fades and his strength returns. Just as a human who runs a wind
sprint eventually recovers from his temporary exhaustion, a wizard who casts a
spell will soon return to his full magical strength with a little rest. Spell
points are recovered as shown on <A HREF="DD03520.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03520.htm">Table 20</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Spell Point Recovery for Channellers.
<P></P>
Characters recover a number of spell points equal to the percentage listed, or
the whole number, whichever is better. For example, a 6th-level mage has 55
spell points. If he sleeps, 10% of 55 would be 6 (round up 5.5) spell points per
hour, so he recovers 8 per hour instead. In fact, it-s more advantageous for
any mage of 7th level or lower to take the listed number, and mages of 8th level
or higher to work with percentages instead. For specialists, 7th-level is the
break point.
<P></P>
In addition to the long-term prospects of exhausting his spell points, a
channelling wizard finds that each spell he casts temporarily tires him. See <A HREF="DD03521.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03521.htm">Table 21</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Spell Fatigue.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><B>Using the Fatigue Chart: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">When a wizard casts a spell, find the row that matches the caster-s level and
then read across until you find the level of the spell. The column it appears
in indicates the fatigue caused by the spell. For example, if an 8th-level
wizard casts a <I>fireball</I>, begin on the row titled -Wizard Lvl. 7?8? and read across until you find the
listing for 3rd-level spell. This spell causes <I>moderate </I>fatigue for the character. If the wizard casts a 4th-level spell, he would
suffer heavy fatigue.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><B>Loss of Hit Points: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">If a character has been reduced to 50% or less of his maximum unwounded hit
point total, the fatigue rating of the spell increases by one. If a character has
been reduced to 25% or less of his normal hit point total, the fatigue rating
increases by two categories. For example, a 5th-level wizard who normally has
16 hit points has been wounded and only has 8 hit points left. When he casts his <I>fireball </I>spell, he becomes <I>severely </I>fatigued instead of <I>heavily </I>fatigued. If he had tried the same spell with only 4 hit points, he would have
been <I>mortally</I> fatigued, which is not good.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><B>Loss of Spell Points: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">In a similar manner, a character who has depleted his magical energy is more
susceptible to fatigue, too. The same rules apply for reduced spell point
totals. Always count the character-s spell points <I>before </I>the spell is cast, so a 1st-level wizard casting his first spell of the day is
beginning with 4 spell points (or more) and not zero! Again, a loss of 50%
increases fatigue by one category, and a loss of 75% increases it by two.
Specialist wizards add their two point totals together for comparing the points spent
to the original total.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><B>Existing Fatigue: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">If a fatigued character casts another spell, increase the fatigue category of
the new spell by one level if he is moderately fatigued, two levels if he is
heavily fatigued, or three levels if he is severely fatigued. The character then
acquires the new fatigue level of the spell he just cast, or stays where he
was, whichever is worse. For example, if the 8th-level wizard mentioned above was
already moderately fatigued and he cast a 2nd- or 3rd-level spell, the new
spell would be considered heavily fatiguing because of his existing condition, and
the wizard would become heavily fatigued. However, if the wizard had cast a
1st-level spell, he would have remained moderately fatigued.
<P></P>
Note that fatigue can accumulate from other sources than casting spells. In
the <I>Player's Option: <A HREF="CT_DD02440.htm"></A></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="CT_DD02440.htm">Combat &amp; Tactics</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>book, there is a fatigue system based on rounds of combat. If this is in play,
a wizard who fights for three or four rounds and then attempts to cast a spell
may be in deep trouble. Characters who are <I>fatigued </I>under that system are considered moderately fatigued here, and <I>exhausted </I>characters are heavily fatigued.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><B>Effects of Fatigue: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Naturally, fatigued characters face some significant disadvantages, as shown
below:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="ba89d1af"></A>
<P></P>
<B>Lightly fatigued </B>characters have no combat penalties, but they risk becoming more exhausted.
Their movement rate is reduced to three-quarters normal, so most human and
demihuman wizards will be reduced from a 12 to a 9. A lightly fatigued character
might suffer from a slight headache or just feel tired.
<P></P>
<A NAME="e659f7d6"></A>
<P></P>
<B>Moderately fatigued </B>characters suffer a ?1 penalty to attack rolls and have their movement rates
halved. Characters at this level of fatigue might have a persistent headache,
slightly hazy vision, and pervasive muscle aches in random areas.
<P></P>
<A NAME="0baf269a"></A>
<P></P>
<B>Heavily fatigued </B>characters suffer an attack penalty of ?2, and an Armor Class penalty of +1.
Their movement is reduced to one-quarter normal. Not only does the character
feel exhausted, but he also suffers from a splitting headache, aches all over and
could suffer from nose bleeds, etc.
<P></P>
<A NAME="115e5d69"></A>
<P></P>
<B>Severely fatigued </B>characters suffer a ?4 penalty to all attacks and a +3 penalty to their Armor
Class. Their movement rate is reduced to 1. It is almost impossible for the
character to stand up at this point (make a Dexterity/Balance check if the
character moves). Of course, he can still concentrate enough to cast spells, but just
barely. Other problems might be the inability to visually focus on anything for
more than a second, extreme ringing in the ears, or whatever seems appropriate
to the DM.
<P></P>
<A NAME="98e994f6"></A>
<P></P>
<B>Mortally fatigued </B>characters are incapable of attacking or effectively defending themselves and
collapse into a trembling heap immediately. The character must attempt a saving
throw vs. paralyzation; if he fails, the strain proves too much and he
perishes. If he passes, he remains unconscious for 1d6 hours before awaking severely
fatigued. Obviously, a channeller should be extremely careful when he begins to
feel tired-he can cause his own death if he overdoes it.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Now that Kerian is armed with spells, he decides it-s time to head on out. As
he is traveling through a lightly forested area, he finds himself facing down
several large spiders. Thinking quickly, he casts his </I>invisibility <I>spell. As a result, he loses 6 spell points and becomes moderately fatigued.
In an attempt to get into a better defensive position, Kerian also realizes that
he is too weak to even think about trying to run away. He manages to stumble
against a jutting boulder. In the meantime, the spiders are having trouble
finding the invisible invoker. Kerian takes this opportunity to prepare his
prolonged casting time version of </I>fireball<I>. After three rounds of gathering energy, Kerian blasts the wicked group of
spiders. Not only does he spend 7 spell points, but now he is severely fatigued.
Gasping for breath and sweating profusely, he watches the burnt remains of the
spiders. Without warning, another large spider bites Kerian. Now he is faced
with a quandary. If he casts even a 1st-level spell, he could perish. But then,
if he doesn-t, he will most certainly die. Kerian manages to cast a final </I>magic missile <I>(the free 1st-level magick that had cost 8 SPs) at the remaining spider before
lapsing into unconsciousness.
<P></P>
</I>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><B>Recovering from Fatigue: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Of course, wizards don-t stay exhausted forever. Just as their spell points
will eventually replenish themselves, their physical capacities will also return.
In order for a wizard to -lose? one step of fatigue, he must make a successful
saving throw vs. paralyzation.
<P></P>
<I>Lightly </I>or <I>moderately fatigued </I>characters can attempt a saving throw for each round of resting.
<P></P>
<I>Heavily fatigued </I>spellcasters can attempt a saving throw for each turn of resting.
<P></P>
<I>Severely fatigued </I>wizards can attempt a saving throw for each full hour of resting.
<P></P>
Each extra round, turn, or hour (as appropriate) spent resting gives the
character a cumulative +1 bonus on his saving throw, so a heavily fatigued wizard
who rests three turns attempts three saving throws-the first with no modifier,
the second with a +1 bonus, the third with a +2 bonus, and so on.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>After four hours, Kerian regains consciousness and sits up. He is severely
fatigued but managed to accrue 8 spell points for each hour that he was
unconscious, which brings him up to his full amount. Since there doesn-t seem to be any
immediate danger, he decides to stay where he is for an hour. At the end of the
hour, Kerian succeeds at a saving throw vs. paralyzation. Although he is now
only heavily fatigued, he still doesn-t feel like moving around (his aching body
is making him feel slightly nauseous). After two turns and three rounds, Kerian
succeeds at two more saving throws. He stands up and resumes his path.</I>
