Also known as the hand-and-a-half sword, the bastard sword derives its name
from the fact that it is halfway between the two-handed sword and the long sword.
<P></P>
The bastard sword has a double-edged blade and a long grip, which can
accommodate both hands if preferred. The overall length of the bastard sword ranges
between four feet and four feet ten inches.
<P></P>
Some bastard swords are equipped with knuckle guards, and others have
asymmetrical pommels shaped like animal or bird heads.

&quot;The bastard sword is an excellent, versatile edged weapon which can be used
one-or two-handed. Using it two-handed gives a warrior better damage potential,
but makes him unable to use a shield. It is also a slower weapon. Using it
one-handed allows the use of a shield, but causes less damage, comparable to that
of a long sword.''
