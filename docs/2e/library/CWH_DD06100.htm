Once you have an idea for a school, it needs a name. If an obvious name
doesn't suggest itself, as it did for the school of illusion, check a thesaurus for
synonymous words or evocative phrases. Fantasy literature is another good source
for names.
<P></P>
Since our new school deals with change, we checked the thesaurus for synonyms
and found <I>metamorphosis</I>, a word that is descriptive, has a nice scholarly ring to it, and even sounds
a little mystical. We'll christen it the school of <I>metamorphics</I>.
