Wizards are severely limited in the weapons they can use. Little if any of
their formal training is devoted to combat, and they usually are unable to devote
the time and effort necessary to master such skills. Consequently, their weapon
choices are confined to those that are easy to learn and simple to use. As a
general rule, the DM should confine wizards to the following weapons:
<P></P>
Blowgun
<P></P>
Barbed dart
<P></P>
Needle
<P></P>
Dagger or dirk
<P></P>
Dart
<P></P>
Knife
<P></P>
Quarterstaff
<P></P>
Sling
<P></P>
Sling bullet
<P></P>
Sling stone
<P></P>
Staff sling
<P></P>
<P></P>
These restrictions apply to magical weapons of similar types as well. For
instance, just as a wizard is denied the use of a two-handed sword, he is denied
the use of a <I>two-handed sword +1</I>.
<P></P>
In certain situations, the DM may allow a wizard to use a weapon other than
those listed above. However, the DM is cautioned to make exceptions to the
wizard's weapon restrictions with care, to avoid unbalancing the game and violating
the special nature of the wizard.
<P></P>
Here are a few situations where the DM might consider making exceptions to the
wizard's weapon restrictions:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>The wizard's kit allows for different weapons.</B> The Anagakok kit, for instance, allows for tridents and harpoons, while the
Amazon kit allows for spears and long bows. If the DM gives permission for
players to pick one of these kits, or another kit with weapons other than those
listed above, he should also allow him to use the kit's weapons. However, the DM is
within his rights to forbid the use of any weapon-- if he decides harpoons are
unavailable in his campaign world, then even an Anagakok cannot use them.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Instruction in the use of a particular weapon was part of the wizard's
training.</B> Just as certain kits allow certain weapons, certain cultures might require
all of its citizens to master certain weapons. A warlike culture, for instance,
might insist that all of its male citizens are to be trained in the use of
swords and spears, and wizards are not excluded. The player must establish these
type of background details at the beginning of his character's career -- they
cannot suddenly be brought into play in the middle of a campaign (&quot;Did I forget to
mention that my character's father trained him to use a club?&quot;). As always, the
DM can veto any background suggestions that he considers unacceptable in his
campaign.
