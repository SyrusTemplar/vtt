This spell allows the caster to more easily access rare or dangerous spell
components. The wizard casts this spell upon a silver mirror while concentrating
on a mental image of the material he desires. The base chance of success is 50%,
modified by the following factors:
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">•</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">+1% per level of the caster
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">•</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">+10% if the caster has seen the same type of substance or object before; this
bonus is
<P></P>
not cumulative with the following bonus
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">•</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">+20% if the caster has a sample of the material or the same type of object in
his
<P></P>
possession; this bonus is not cumulative with the bonus above
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">•</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">+30% if the wizard knows the location of the desired object
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">•</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">-50% if the caster has never seen the same type of material or item before
<P></P>
<P></P>
If the percentile roll indicates failure, the caster is unable to locate the
desired ingredient and the spell ends. If the roll indicates success, the wizard
has located the object or substance and the mirror becomes a magical gate
through which the caster can see the target. The size of the gate is determined by
the size of the mirror, to a maximum size of 3 feet by 2 feet.
<P></P>
The gate always appears within arm's length of the target, allowing the wizard
to reach through the mirror, grasp the object of his desire, and draw it back
through the gate. The wizard must risk his own safety--the gate does not allow
the use of probes, long-handled ladles, tongs, or other equipment to gather the
material. The caster cannot move completely through the gate.
<P></P>
The gate vanishes when the spell's duration expires or when the target or the
wizard moves more than 10' away from it.
<P></P>
The gate is visible from both sides, and other creatures can reach through the
gate. Breath weapons, gaze attacks, missiles, spells, and similar attacks
cannot be cast through the gate. Because creatures can pass their limbs through the
gate, physical attacks and touch spells can be used.
<P></P>
The only limit to the range of this spell is that the caster and the target
must be on the same plane of existence. Elemental forces (not creatures) will not
pass through the gate. Thus, the wizard does not run the risk of flooding his
laboratory by opening a gate beneath the sea, for example. However, the spell
does not provide any sort of protection against a hostile environment.
<P></P>
The material components are an exquisite silver mirror of no less than 10,000
gp value and a black opal worth at least 1,000 gp which must be powdered and
sprinkled on the mirror. The mirror is not lost after casting and may be used
again, but the powdered opal is consumed in the casting.
