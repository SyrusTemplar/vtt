After creating your character's ability scores, you must select a player
character race. This is not a race in the true sense of the word: caucasian, black,
asian, etc. It is actually a fantasy species for your character -- human, elf,
dwarf, gnome, half-elf, or halfling. Each race is different. Each possesses
special powers and has different lists of classes to choose from.
<P></P>
All six of the standard races are described in detail in this chapter. In many
cases, broad statements are made concerning the race in general. Players are
not bound by these generalities. For example, the statement that ?dwarves tend
to be dour and taciturn? does not mean that your character cannot be a jolly
dwarf. It means that the garden-variety dwarf is dour and taciturn. If player
characters were just like everyone else, they wouldn't be adventurers. Make your
character unique and he will be more fun to play.
