<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Ring of Fortitude: </B>When worn, the <I>ring of fortitude</I> grants the wearer a bonus of +4 to one randomly selected ability score (roll
1d12: 1-6=Dexterity, 7-11=Wisdom, 12=Constitution) <B>for the purposes of spell resolution only</B>. It does not affect ability checks or other aspects of ability scores, except
those as a direct result of spells or spell-like abilities.
<P></P>
For example, a character with a natural Constitution of 14 would have an
enhanced score of 18 while wearing such a ring. He does not gain any extra hit
points from wearing it, but his system shock for resolving the <I>polymorph other spell</I> is increased to 99%. With the Constitution-enhancing ring, the bonuses even
apply to the <I>raise dead</I> and <I>resurrection</I> spells. All effects are lost when the wearer removes the ring.
