The main difference between oriental and occidental armor, from a
game-mechanics point of view, is descriptive. Oriental armor is colorful and elaborately
constructed, often brightly enamelled or decorated with paint or painted
leathers, silk cords, precious-metal plating, etc.

But from a game-mechanic point of view, leather armor is leather armor, plate
is plate. Samurai wear armor that is the equivalent of padded leather, studded
leather, scale mail, and brigandine; basic costs, weights, and AC values are
identical to the western armor styles. However, a samurai may wish to spend more
than the minimum amount on his armor; the extra money goes into making it a
remarkable example of eastern art.

The samurai also have one sort of armor unknown to the west: The <I>kote</I>. This is a pair of armored sleeves which may be worn concealed under the
samurai's tunic.
<P></P>
Mechanically, the kote costs twice as much as and acts almost the same as a
buckler. There are a couple of differences between buckler and kote, though. Kote
cannot be Disarmed, and you can use weapons in the hands of the arms to which
kote are attacked. Although the kote consists of a pair of sleeves, you do not
get a +2 bonus to AC; only the +1 normally conferred by a buckler.
