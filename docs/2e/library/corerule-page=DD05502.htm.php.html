Many types of priests also have special Granted Powers. The basic Cleric, for
instance, can turn undead. The Druid starts out with bonuses to specific saving
throws and speaks an additional specific language, and gains other granted
powers as he gains in levels.
<P></P>
The DM should add at least one Granted Power to the abilities of a priest of a
specific mythos; this gives the priest more individual flavor and character.
The DM could add several, if this specific priest-class is weak compared to
other priests.
<P></P>
Additionally, as with the Druid, the DM can arrange things so that the priest
acquires new Granted Powers at certain experience levels, instead of receiving
all of them at first level.
<P></P>
Granted Powers come in three levels: High Powers, Medium Powers, and Low
Powers.
<P></P>
As with all the priest's special abilities, Granted Powers should be chosen
for the priest based on the attributes of the worshipped god. It's not
inappropriate to give a water-breathing ability to the priest of an ocean-god, but is
quite inappropriate for the priest of a god of the desert winds.
<P></P>
Some Granted Powers may be used any time the priest wishes and when
circumstances allow. For example, normal clerics can try to Turn Undead as many times in
a day as they wish (but it can only work when they're facing undead,
naturally). Other Granted Powers may only be used a certain number of times per day. When
the DM first adds a Granted Power to the listing of a priest's abilities, he
must define how often and under what conditions the Granted Power may work.
