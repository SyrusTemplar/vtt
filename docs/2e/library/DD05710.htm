?? <B>Description:</B> The restless spirit of the Explorer makes him the most nomadic of all
rangers. His travels take him around the world, as he continually seeks new lands to
investigate and new cultures to study. No region is too remote, no society too
primitive to pique the Explorer's interest. An expert in communication,
survival, and anthropology, the Explorer's skills are invaluable for safely navigating
uncharted terrain and negotiating with suspicious natives.
<P></P>
?? <B>Requirements:</B> An Explorer must have a minimum Intelligence score of 12.
<P></P>
?? <B>Primary Terrain:</B> Any (no specialization; use for followers and species enemy only).
<P></P>
?? <B>Role:</B> Motivated as much by curiosity as money, the Explorer spends more of his time
planning expeditions than looking for employment. Still, Explorers are in high
demand as guides, mapmakers, and scouts. A reputable Explorer can demand a
high price for his services. However, rumors of a lost civilization are more
likely to intrigue an Explorer than the promise of treasure, and he chooses his jobs
accordingly.
<P></P>
?? Though a Pathfinder (discussed elsewhere in this chapter) or similarly skilled
guide plays a crucial role in leading an expedition through unexplored
territory, it's often an Explorer who's actually in charge. The Explorer decides when
it's best to forge ahead and when to rest. He knows that small parties travel
better than large ones, as each additional member increases the likelihood of
delays from injury and disease. Above all, he understands the relationship
between safety and self-restraint. He discourages his companions from taking
unnecessary risks whenever possible.
<P></P>
?? An Explorer balances his natural impulsiveness with healthy doses of caution
and common sense. More of a scholar than a brawler, he is usually a reluctant
combatant, resorting to violence only when all other options fail. But when
attacking, he fights with a single-mindedness that can border on savagery. A
seasoned Explorer counsels his companions to follow two rules vital to wilderness
survival, particularly where primitive civilizations are suspected to exist: (1)
negotiating is usually preferable to attacking; and (2) if you intend to attack,
then attack to kill.
<P></P>
?? <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Fisher, Forester, Hunter, Navigator, Trader/Barterer, Trapper/Furrier.
<P></P>
?? <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Because an Explorer favors lightweight, easy-to-use weapons, his weapon
proficiencies are confined to the following choices: short bow, light crossbow,
dagger, dart, knife, sling, short sword.
<P></P>
?? <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Special Bonus:</I> Survival; the Explorer receives the benefits of this proficiency in all
terrain types. Assigning additional slots to this proficiency does not enhance its
use in any way. <I>Required:</I> Cartography*, Reading/Writing. <I>Recommended:</I> Ancient History, Bowyer/Fletcher, Camouflage*, Direction Sense, Distance
Sense*, Endurance, Fire-building, Fishing, Foraging*, Herbalism, Hunting, Languages
(Ancient and Modern), Mountaineering, Navigation, Rope Use, Signaling*,
Swimming, Trail Marking*, Trail Signs*, Weather Sense.
<P></P>
?? <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> An Explorer has no special armor or equipment requirements. However, he
rarely wears armor heavier than leather and most Explorers find shields awkward and
confining.
<P></P>
?? <B>Species Enemy:</B> Any.
<P></P>
? <B>Followers:</B> An Explorer has the normal 2d6 career limit (however, see Special Hindrances).
<P></P>
?? <B>Special Benefits:
<P></P>
</B>?? <I>Languages:</I> An Explorer has the capability of learning twice the normal number of
languages allowed by his Intelligence score (see Table 4 in Chapter 1 of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>). For instance, an Explorer with an Intelligence score of 12 can learn six
languages instead of the usual three. All languages still cost a proficiency slot
each.
<P></P>
?? <I>Find the Path:</I> The Explorer can use this ability to sense the correct direction that will
eventually lead to a desired geographical locale, which must be in an outdoor
setting. The Explorer must have some clue, map, information, or body of research
about the locale in order to use this ability. It can be used once per week,
providing a day's worth of guidance (hence it is of greatest use on an expedition
of weeks or months duration).
<P></P>
<I>Culture Sense:</I> This ability allows the Explorer to acquire general knowledge about the laws
and customs of a tribe, village, or settlement. Once per week, the Explorer may
attempt to use this ability by touching a member of the tribe or village. The
villager must have the knowledge the Explorer wishes to gain; for instance, the
villager can't be an infant or mentally deficient. Cooperation of the villager
isn't required; touching an attacking or sleeping villager works as well.
<P></P>
?? The villager must make a saving throw vs. spells. If the throw succeeds, the
Explorer learns nothing. If the throw fails, the Explorer acquires an instant
understanding of the villager's laws and customs, including those applicable to
related clans or tribes (such as the social etiquette pertaining to all
aarakocra in the region, not just this particular group). Information learned through
this ability might include local laws (no one is allowed on the village streets
after dark without written permission), accepted courtesies (strangers bow to
all children), and cultural taboos (hats and other head coverings are considered
offensive). Successful use of this ability also gives the Explorer a +1
reaction adjustment when encountering any other members of the tribe, village, or
settlement.
<P></P>
?? The DM may limit the quality and amount of information in any way he sees fit.
The knowledge acquired through this ability doesn't ensure proper conduct; the
Explorer's behavior (and the player's decisions) will ultimately determine the
reaction of all villagers.
<P></P>
?? <B>Special Hindrances:
<P></P>
</B>?? <I>Limited Animal Empathy:</I> Because he spends little time in one place, and much of his time is spent on
native cultures and geographical studies, an Explorer does not develop animal
empathy to the degree of other rangers. When dealing with wild or attack-trained
animals, the animal's saving throw vs. rods has a +2 bonus. Further, the
Explorer must make a successful Wisdom check when trying to calm or befriend
domestic animals.
<P></P>
?? <I>Few Followers:</I> The Explorer would travel lightly, unencumbered by followers that require his
attention. Thus, he will have no more than two followers at the same time. If
he already has two followers, a new follower won't arrive until one of his
current followers is dismissed, lost, or killed.
<P></P>
?? <I>No Fortifications:</I> An Explorer has little interest in the responsibilities associated with
property ownership. He will never build a castle or any other fortification.
