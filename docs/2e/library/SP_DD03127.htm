<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Lazy:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A lazy character will never do any more work than is absolutely necessary. He
will rely on his companions to do things such as build campfires, cook, and
keep watch through the night. The character will generally neglect details of
preparedness in favor of catching a few minutes more sleep. However, if he really
wants to do something that does not have a clear and urgent need (digging a
trench around a camp in case an attack is made against them, for example) the
character can roll a Wisdom/Willpower check. A ?4 modifier applies to the
character?s Willpower score, however, and failure of the check means that the character
decides the time could be better used by catching a little shut-eye?or at least
by lying in the shade somewhere.
