</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">If a character is able to cock and load several crossbows or ready several
firearms for firing, he can get several shots off very quickly. As long as the
character has loaded weapons close at hand, he can triple his normal rate of fire.
When he runs out of loaded weapons, he?ll have to resume firing at the normal
rate.
