A wizard's adventures can take him to all kinds of exotic locations. But if he
finds himself battling foes beneath the ocean's surface or exploring a
mysterious locale in an alternate plane of existence, he will discover that his spells
are operating a little differently than usual. This chapter explains the
differences.
<P></P>
Spell casting abilities can also be affected by sensory changes, such as a
temporary loss of vision, an impaired ability to speak, and impaired movement.
These problems, as well as how a wizard's spells are affected when cast under less
than optimum conditions and how he might compensate for these differences,
will be discussed in this chapter.
