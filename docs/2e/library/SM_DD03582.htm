Spells and Knockdown Dice
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Clearly, not every spell has the potential for a knockdown. Enchantments such
as <I>charm person </I>or <I>slow </I>may create serious difficulties for the victim, but they-re not going to throw
him to the ground in the process. Other spells cause -knockdowns? just by
their nature; <I>sleep, grease</I>, and <I>ice storm </I>can put creatures on the ground by virtue of their normal effects. <A HREF="DD03584.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03584.htm">Table 44</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Spells with Knockdown Effects list spells that actually use the knockdown
rules.
<P></P>
For spells from other sources, use your best judgment in assigning a knockdown
die. First of all, the spell must deliver energy to the target or cause a
physiological reaction that might cause the subject to lose control of his
limbs-for example, the agony associated with <I>Abi-Dalzim-s horrid wilting </I>or <I>throbbing bones </I>has a chance to distract even the stoutest warrior, despite the fact that
neither spell actually strikes the victim with a tangible blow. You may observe
that <I>lightning bolts </I>are particularly good for knockdowns, because they strike the target with an
immense amount of energy and electrocute the victim at the same time!
<P></P>
Spells that stun, daze, sleep, confuse, charm, hold, trip, fumble, or tangle
the opponent don-t need a knockdown die; if the spell succeeds, the victim is
hindered by the action of the spell itself, and a knockdown would be redundant.
Last but not least, spells that simulate weapons (<I>Mordenkainen-s sword</I>, for example) can use a knockdown die based on the weapon itself; see <I>Player-s Option: <A HREF="CT_DD02726.htm"></A></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="CT_DD02726.htm">Combat &amp; Tactics</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>for a complete listing of weapons and knockdown ratings.
