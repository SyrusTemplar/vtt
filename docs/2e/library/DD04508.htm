<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Robe of Repetition:</B> This ordinary-looking robe radiates strong alteration magic if magic is
detected. The wearer of this robe acquires a unique and powerful augmentation to his
magic. After casting a spell, there is a percentage chance that a
mnemonic/harmonic effect occurs so that the magical energies liberated in spellcasting are
amplified and retained briefly. The wizard is then able to cast the same spell
a second time. This must be done on the succeeding round or the bonus spell is
lost.
<P></P>
Once the spell has been cast a second time, the energy is completely
liberated. There is no possibility of a third casting. In all cases, the spell is lost
from the wizard's memory until the wizard memorizes it again.
<P></P>
The chance of a spell being available for a second casting varies according to
spell level:

Energy from spells of 6th level and above are not retained within the robe's
magical weave. Furthermore, a maximum of 24 spell levels per day can be reused
with the benefit of this robe. If the wizard opts not to use a spell which is
made available for a second use, this counts toward the maximum limit.
<P></P>
If a wizard removes the robe, spells cast while the robe is off do not count
toward the spell limit. For example, if a wizard casts 15 spell levels that
count against the robe's daily limit and he then removes the robe, subsequent
spells do not count against the robe's limit. If the wizard then puts on the robe
during the same day and casts more spells, the robe retains the 15 spell levels
that counted against it and all spells cast subsequently also count against the
robe.
<P></P>
Only one wizard may use the robe's magic in a single day; if a second wizard
puts on the robe, it does not function.
