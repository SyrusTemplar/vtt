This spell causes a ghostly, glowing hand, shaped from the caster's life
force, to materialize within the spell range and move as the caster desires. Any
touch attack spell of 4th level or less that is subsequently cast by the wizard
can be delivered by the spectral hand. The spell gives the caster a +2 bonus to
his attack roll. The caster cannot perform any other actions when attacking with
the hand; the hand returns to the caster and hovers if the caster takes other
actions. The hand lasts the full spell duration unless dismissed by the caster,
and it is possible to use more than one touch attack with it. The hand
receives flank and rear attack bonuses if the caster is in a position to do so. The
hand is vulnerable to magical attack but has an Armor Class of -2. Any damage to
the hand ends the spell and inflicts 1d4 points of damage to the caster.
