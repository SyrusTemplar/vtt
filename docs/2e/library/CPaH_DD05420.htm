   Paladins take their equipment seriously, and seek to own the best that money
can buy. Not only does their equipment reflect the honor of their station; for
some it symbolizes their principles.

• The shield represents the paladin's vow to uphold his ethos.
<P></P>
• The sword represents the two constituencies he's sworn to defend—one edge of
the sword represents the privileged class, the other the common people.
<P></P>
• Armor represents loyalty to the state. Just as his armor protects his body,
so must he protect his monarch.
<P></P>
• The helmet represents loyalty to the religion. Just as his helmet protects
his head, so must he protect his church.
<P></P>
• Clothing, well-crafted and immaculately clean, represents purity of spirit.
