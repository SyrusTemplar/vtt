Even the best-trained dog (watchdog or tracking dog) finds it impossible to
avoid being distracted when there are cats about. This is exploited by the few
alchemists who have the recipe for the manufacture of catstink. These few are
well-paid by thieves' guilds for their work, blending various liquids obtained
from diverse parts of cats with a few secret ingredients to produce a thick,
foul-smelling, brown-yellow liquid, catstink.
<P></P>
Catstink is specifically blended to drive any dog to distraction, allowing the
thief to get past watchdogs as they frantically try to locate the cat which
they can smell so pungently. Dogs who can smell catstink will not do anything
other than try to get at the source of the smell, no matter how highly trained.
Spells (<I>slow, neutralize poison</I>) are only useful if the dog is wholly removed from the smell. Even then the
effect of the spell will not be evident until one turn has elapsed and the dog
returns to normal.
<P></P>
Catstink can also be used to delay dogs tracking a thief as he attempts to
make an escape, in much the same way as aniseed is used, albeit much more
effectively (and much more expensively). The smell of catstink can be picked up by dogs
up to 200 yards away, or even as far as half a mile if they are downwind of it.
