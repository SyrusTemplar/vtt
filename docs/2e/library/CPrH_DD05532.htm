<P></P>
This god is the protector of animals. He could intend to protect animals from
all harm, and thus be the enemy of all hunters, rangers, and carnivores of all
descriptions. Most often he's primarily interested in keeping animal species
intact, not allowing them to be hunted to extinction, etc., and thus allows a
reasonable amount of hunting and trapping to take place.
<P></P>
The priests of this god also work hard to keep excess hunting and trapping in
check, and to remind the flock that the god will avenge abuses. Typically, this
god is content to be counted as one of many gods and almost never insists on
being the primary deity worshipped by the flock.
<P></P>
A lesser type of animal-god is one who is the protector of a single species or
group of species. Such a deity might be the lion-god, or the god of all
felines, or the god of elephants, or the god of porpoises and dolphins. In a
primitive society, all members of a nomadic tribe might worship the god of the herd
animal the tribe hunts (bison, for example).
<P></P>
Animal deities are often male.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with Druids and the priests of
Earth, Fertility, Hunting, Life-Death-Rebirth Cycle, Nature, Oceans/Rivers (only if
priesthood has some association with aquatic animals), and Race (Elven).
<P></P>
<B>Alignment:</B> The deity is true neutral. The priests may be neutral evil, true neutral, or

<P></P>
<B>Powers:</B> <I>Identification </I>(as described in the Designing Faiths chapter) of any natural monster or
animal the priest sees. (A &quot;natural&quot; monster or animal is one which exists as a
species, within an ecological niche, spawns and rears its young, and has so existed
as a species for at least five years. Newly-created animal species, fiends,
constructs, and similar monsters do not fall into this category; when the priest
sees them, he will only be able to identify them if he has encountered them
before.) <I>Language/Communication</I> (as described in the Designing Faiths chapter): The priest can communicate
with three specific animal species (for example, lion, raven, wolf) <I>or</I> one category of animals (for example, all felines, all canines); the DM
decides which ones based on the god's attributes, but if the god's attributes do not
dictate specific choices the DM can give the choice to the player. <I>Soothing Word</I> (as described in the Designing Faiths chapter, but only usable on &quot;natural&quot;
monsters or animals).<I> At 5th Level: Shapechanging</I> (as described in the Designing Faiths chapter; again, the DM decides which
shape or shapes are changed into according to the god's attributes, or can give
the choice to the player).
<P></P>
<B>Followers and Strongholds:</B> The followers are received at 9th level, and consist of one fifth-level
priest, one third-level priest, and twelve first-level priests, all of the same
order, plus one third-level ranger and seven first-level rangers. The priest may
take the following on adventures: Three priests and two rangers of his choice.
The priesthood will pay for half of the cost of stronghold construction at 9th
level. The temple acts as an animal hospice, a &quot;hospital&quot; for sick or injured
animals brought in by the rangers; many scholars also visit these strongholds in
order to learn, from the rangers, more about animals and monsters in their
natural habitat.
<P></P>
<B>Possible Symbols:</B> Any animal; claws.
<P></P>
<B>Notes:</B> The weapons allowed for this priesthood were chosen for their similarity to
animal attacks. That's why there are lots of weapons with piercing and slashing
attacks, but no ranged weapons or cleaving attacks.
