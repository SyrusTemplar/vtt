<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wand of Size Alteration: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A wand of this sort enables the wielder to cause any single creature of
virtually any size to <I> enlarge</I> or<I> diminish.</I> Either effect causes a 50% change in size.
<P></P>
Relative Strength and power increases or decreases proportionally, providing
the weaponry employed is proportionate or usable. For humanoid creatures
enlarged, Strength is roughly proportional to that of a giant of corresponding size.
For example, a humanoid enlarged to 9 feet tall is roughly equivalent to a hill
giant (19 strength), and a 13-foot tall humanoid equals a fire giant (22
Strength).
<P></P>
The wand's power has a range of 10 feet. The target creature and all it is
wearing or carrying are affected unless a saving throw succeeds. Note that a
willing target need not to make a saving throw.
<P></P>
The effect of the wand can be removed by a <I>dispel magic</I> spell, but if this is done, the target must roll a system shock check. It can
also be countered if the possessor of the wand wills the effect to be canceled
before the duration of the effect expires. Each usage of the wand (but not the
cancellation of an effect) expends one charge. It can be recharged by a wizard
of 12th or higher level.
