It's possible for a priest to renounce his faith # to declare that he is no
longer a priest of a particular god. When that happens, he has one of two choices.
<P></P>
He can stop belonging to the priest-class and start over as a rogue, wizard,
or priest of another god, according to the rules for dual-class characters.
Naturally, he loses all his granted powers.
<P></P>
If his priesthood had Good Combat Abilities, he can lose one experience level
and become a fighter; if Medium Combat Abilities, he can lose two levels and
become a fighter; if Poor Combat Abilities, he can start over as a fighter
according to the rules for dual-class characters. He'll never again be a priest.
