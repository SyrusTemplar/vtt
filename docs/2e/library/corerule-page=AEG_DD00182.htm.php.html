</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Apron</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Aprons are worn for a variety of reasons. The most common uses are to protect
clothing and the wearer of the apron. This can range from a simple cloth apron
worn while preparing a meal to the wearing of a leather apron by a blacksmith.
Such aprons are made of thick leather and are intended to protect the wearer
from flying sparks and chips of metal.
<P></P>
Cost: Cloth 5-8 sp, Leather 8-12 gp
<P></P>

<P></P>
These pouches are made from a variety of fabrics including leather, silk,
wool, or linen and come in a variety of sizes. A special type of pouch is called
the almoner. It is worn by members of the upper class and is used especially for
holding money to be given as alms, hence the name.
<P></P>
All such items are usually attached at the belt or girdle. The pouch might be
in plain sight, or, often in populated areas, it might be belted to the
undertunic so the wandering eyes of thieves wouldn't see it.
<P></P>
Cost: 4-8 cp
<P></P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Baldric, Bandoleer</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Usually made of leather (or silk for those who can afford it), this article of
clothing is slung around the body from one shoulder to the opposite hip and is
used to carry a dagger, pouch, bugle, or sword. Some baldrics are decorated
with bells or tassels along the bottom edge. Baldrics are used both for
decoration by the lords and ladies of the aristocracy, and for practical purposes by
adventurers and government officials. Women of the upper class may wear silk
baldrics with gold bells for ornamentation.
<P></P>
Decorative baldrics always have tassels, bells, or other adornments and are
made of fashionable materials such as silk or brocade. Functional baldrics, in
contrast, are composed only of leather and a buckle, for ease of use and
practicality.
<P></P>
Cost: Ornamental 25-50 gp, Leather 7-10 gp

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Band</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Bands are variations of collars that include the ruff that is favored by
royalty. Some bands simply fold over the outer shirt and are called a falling band,
while others are designed to stand up, and are appropriately called a standing
band. The ruff is reserved for formal occasions, while a falling band might be
used for daily wear by an official. Most peasants and adventurers believe the
wearing of these bands to be snobbish and a blatant attempt to emulate the
aristocracy.
<P></P>
Cost: 1-4 sp
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Boots</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Boots are an important part of the wardrobe for traveling and outdoor work and
adventuring. They are vital for protection against cold and wet conditions as
well as hot and rocky terrains. Many peasants need to wear boots indoors as
well, as their living conditions preclude much comfort or heat.
<P></P>
Boots may be found in many stages of design. One of the most popular is the
pointed toe variety. The extended toe is especially popular among performers and
jugglers, although thieves would do well to avoid them. The pointed toe tends
to get in the way while climbing and running.
<P></P>
Another common and functional boot is the leather, mid-calf boot with
roll-tops, laced up the side. A variation on the mid-calfboot is the knee-high boots,
worn by peasants and called cockers.
<P></P>
Elegant designs reign at court. Such boots might be made of soft leather and
even silk, embroidered or inlaid with gems. These are more for show than any
practical purpose. See Shoes for more information about footwear.
<P></P>
Cost: 2-8 gp

A seemingly inconspicuous piece of a person's clothing, buckles actually hold
great significance. The buckle is one of the items that denotes wealth and

steel, copper, and even ceramic. Along with the basic form of the buckle,
these items might be engraved, inset with jewels, or otherwise adorned.

fabric. The most common forms are a circular piece of fabric with a hole in the
center for the head, and fabric draped from neck, connected by a chain, brooch,
cord, or pins.

during those cold nights under the stars.

to conceal objects and allow the wearer full, unhindered movement.

made of soft leather, suede, or kid and are adorned with embroidery, jewels, and

their helmets during tournaments. They may be used as pledges and can be tossed

roughly-fitting trousers; they evolved into a tighter-fitting garment. The material used
to make hose can range from homespun cloth for peasants to velvet and silk for

difference is that hose have a tighter fit than drawers. Both garments serve the
same function, keeping the wearer's legs warm.

<P></P>
This tight, ruffled collar is worn encircling the entire neck. The ruff is
highly admired within the upper class and is used almost exclusively by
aristocracy. Although held in disdain by the lower class and most adventurers, the ruff
is an excellent piece of clothing for a thief to own, especially one who enjoys
disguises. Wearing an authentic ruff in conjunction with other appropriate
upper class clothing will almost always guarantee entrance to aristocratic
functions with little or no fuss over invitations.

<P></P>
</B>Peasants and poor adventurers often wear a simple piece of rawhide as
footwear, often with the fur still on it. A leather thong is threaded through the top
of the piece of leather and tied at the top in order to hold the leather in
place.
<P></P>
Wealthier people wear a basic leather shoe, constructed with a pointed toe.
The length of the toe varies according to the individual shoemaker. Some shoe
points are so long that they must be chained up and fastened at the knee. This
