</B>Bad Guys Don-t Fight Fair</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
Two of the things that make bad guys truly evil is their desire to win at all
costs and their determination to make someone else pay those costs. There is no
trick too low, dirty, or mean for a truly dishonorable villain.
<P></P>
Many times, the villain makes sure that there are innocent bystanders milling
around before a battle starts. Not only does this prevent the PCs from using
their powerful area of effect spells against the villain's henchmen, it also
confuses the PCs? ability to determine their true enemies. Of course, the villain
cares little for the innocents in his midst; they only serve as a shield against
the PCs. Meeting the heroes in an empty dungeon chamber or in a deserted
street for the equivalent of a fantasy gunfight allows the high-level party to bring
all of their guns to bear, spelling almost certain defeat for the villain.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The opponent might create a diversion that forces the PCs to abandon the
fight. For example, if a battle is taking place in a town, the opponent might set a
fire. The PCs must choose between pressing the attack or saving the town. They
are likely to become very unpopular if they choose the former. They might even
be accused of setting the blaze.
<P></P>
Innocent Bystanders
<P></P>
Particularly villainous opponents have no compunctions against using missile
weapons and area of effect spells against PCs when they are surrounded by
innocent bystanders. A panicking crowd might very well hinder the PCs by blocking
vision, disrupting spellcasting, and restricting movement.
<P></P>
Villains might even set up a passerby so the heroes-in the heat of
battle-mistake an innocent person as part of the villain's band. Even low-level illusions
are quite effective at misleading a party in the midst of a battle, and it-s
unlikely that the PCs take time to verify each and every target of their attacks.
Once the battle is over, the townspeople might accuse the PCs of murder, since
all of the other bystanders saw the PCs attack without provocation.

<P></P>
The opponent might attack a target that has sentimental value but little
strategic or tactical value, such as a family home. The attack might not do a great
deal of harm, but it can goad the PCs into making decisions based on emotion
instead of careful thought. For example, the PCs might expend a great deal of
time and resources guarding their family homes while bandits stalk the countryside.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Contingency Plans
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Intelligent opponents, and especially major villains, don-t meet the PCs in a
fair fight. Villains always have escape routes and they use them when needed.
Most villains do not risk even the chance of meeting the heroes in combat unless
they have an advantage the PCs don-t know about.
