The lump term &quot;savages&quot; is being used here to refer to any number of different
types of people. They have in common these traits: They're not as
technologically advanced as the normal peoples of the campaign, though some do make weapons
of bronze or iron; and they're probably hunter-gatherers who have not yet
embraced the agricultural revolution. And that's really all they have to have in
common. &quot;Savages&quot; might be highly cultured, artistic, peaceful peoples, but if
they have dirt floors or flint-tipped weapons, the rest of the world calls them
savage. For our purposes, &quot;savages&quot; encompasses Neanderthal man, Old Stone Age
Cromagnon, and New Stone Age modern men.
<P></P>
Stereotypical savages know the following weapons: Blowgun (mostly jungle
tribes), Long and Short bow (no composite bows), Club, Dagger, Hand/Throwing Axe,
Javelin, Knife, Sling, and Spear.
<P></P>
Depending on their level of technological development, they may make their
weapons (including arrowheads, spear-heads, etc.) out of iron, bronze, stone or
even bone.
<P></P>
For our purposes, iron and bronze weapons have the same characteristics as
steel weapons; it's not worth generating all-new weapon stats for the slight
game-mechanic differences.
<P></P>
Stone and bone weapons, on the other hand, require their own statistics, which
is why they're represented on the weapon chart at the top of the chapter.

Stone weapons are used just like their modern counterparts, but are worth less
money, do less damage, and are more prone to shattering.
<P></P>
The damages and costs (should some ever be sold on the market) for these
weapons are given on the chart above.
<P></P>
Stone weapons have a chance of breaking every time they hit and do damage.
Every time a stone weapon successfully hits a target, the player must roll 1d6.
Regardless of the roll, this attack does its full damage, but on a roll of 1 on
the 1d6, the weapon or weapon-head shatters and is useless.

Bone weapons are likewise used like their modern counterparts, but are worth
even less money, can only be used with smaller stabbing weapons (knives and
daggers), and shatter even more readily?on a roll of 1 or 2 on 1d6.

Generally, no one in his right mind is going to trade in nice, modern steel
weapons for bone or stone counterparts. But characters don't always have the
choice.
<P></P>
Characters with the Savage warrior kit start out with the level of weapons the
DM decides for him: &quot;Modern,&quot; stone or bone. In a campaign where most savages
are simply hunter-gatherers who live at a certain distance from the PCs'
culture, but who trade and interact with them, modern weapons are fine. When the
savage culture is far away and more technologically primitive, stone weapons are
more appropriate. If the savages are supposed to be very primitive indeed, bone
weapons are the proper choice. In all likelihood, these savage characters,
reaching more advanced lands and seeing how much more damage more modern weapons
will do, will make the switch. . . though they're likely to stick to the <I>types</I> of weapons they know best (spears, bows, daggers, etc.).
<P></P>
Remember, though, that the <I>club</I> is the same weapon regardless of technological advancement; the surliest
caveman can make a club that has the weapon stats of the most modern baseball bat.
<P></P>
Also, player-characters might find themselves stripped of weapons and cast
adrift in the wilderness. If they want weapons, they'll have to make them,
possibly of stone or bone. For these purposes, too, the weapon stats above can be
useful.
