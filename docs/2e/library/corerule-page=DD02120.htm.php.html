Following the name of each priest spell, a <I>magical school</I> is given in parentheses. This is for reference purposes only. For instance,
Wisdom bonuses apply to saving throws vs. enchantment/charm spells. If the
appropriate magical school were not listed with priest spells, it would be hard to
figure out which spells were considered to be enchantment/charms. There are a
few other reasons one might need to know this information. The priest spells are
not really organized into magical schools, but rather into <I>spheres of influence,</I> as described in <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01473.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01473.htm.php.html">Chapter 3</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">: Player Character Classes and <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01648.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01648.htm.php.html">Chapter 7</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">: Magic.
