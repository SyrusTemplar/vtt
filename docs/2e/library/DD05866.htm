The picture here might seem to be similar to opposition, but the law is still
weaker in dealing with thieves. This may be for a variety of reasons.
Under-funding and under-manning may be especially important. Significant corruption may
be present (especially higher up the scale). The society may be chaotic or
anarchic. There may be a reason why thievery is not a major worry (a weak thieves'
guild, major external threats to a city-state so that most able-bodied men are
in a fighting militia, a very rough port where serious assaults and worse are a
much bigger headache than thieves, etc.).
<P></P>
In such situations, the law not only doesn't do anything about all but the
most serious thiefly crimes, but officers of the law may even get testy and
irritated with people who complain about them too much, especially if they are
foreigners!
