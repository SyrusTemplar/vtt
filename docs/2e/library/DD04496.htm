<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Mist Tent:</B> A <I>mist tent</I> is contained in a small glass flask. Removing the stopper causes a stream of
white mist to pour from the flask. One round later, the mist shapes itself into
the form of a 10'x 12' tent with a single, open flap in the front. The stopper
must be replaced in the flask as soon as the <I>mist tent</I> takes shape, or the tent will dissipate as described below.
<P></P>
The <I>mist tent</I> has the density of a cloud when unoccupied. When one or more characters enter
the <I>mist tent</I>, the flap can be closed; from the inside, the flap has the density of canvas.
From the inside, the walls and ceiling of the <I>mist tent</I> appear as opaque white mist, and the floor is transparent. Despite its
appearance, the entire <I>mist tent</I> has the density of canvas once the flap is closed. When the flap is closed,
the following effects occur:
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">?</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The <I>mist tent </I>and all occupants and items inside become invisible to all creatures outside
the tent. A <I>detect invisibility</I> spell cast by a creature outside the tent reveals the <I>mist tent</I>.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">?</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The <I>mist tent </I>rises 10 feet off the ground; it continues to hover in place as long as the
flap remains closed. The transparent floor allows occupants of the tent to
clearly see the surrounding area. The floor of the <I>mist tent</I> can support 1,000 pounds without rupturing.
<P></P>
<P></P>
If the flap is opened, the <I>mist tent 's</I> walls, floor, and ceiling instantly become visible to outsiders, appearing as
a thin, white mist. Additionally, the <I>mist tent</I> slowly descends, landing gently on the ground. If the stopper is removed from
the flask, the tent dissipates, returning to the flask in a stream of white
mist; if the bottle is not stoppered immediately, the mist will pour from the
flask to form the <I>mist tent</I> again.
<P></P>
The <I>mist tent</I> is unharmed by all types of fire, but does not offer such protection to its
occupants. The tent is susceptible to other forms of damage. It provides no more
protection to its occupants than a normal canvas tent.
<P></P>
The <I>mist tent</I> has AC 10. If the <I>mist tent</I> sustains 10 points of damage, it dissipates in a shower of light and is
permanently negated. If this occurs while the mist tent is hovering, all occupants
plummet to the ground. If the <I>mist tent </I>sustains less than 10 points of damage, it can be returned to its flask, then
re-released; all damage will be repaired.
