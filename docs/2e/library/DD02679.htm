<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Wrestling </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Wrestling includes all attacks aimed at grasping and holding an opponent. Any
creature with racial intelligence of at least semi- can make wrestling attacks
if it also has grasping appendages that it could use to restrain an opponent.
Incorporeal and amorphous creatures cannot make wrestling attacks and cannot be
wrestled. Limbless creatures, such as worms, snakes, and the like, generally
cannot wrestle, though constrictor snakes can be assumed to be using a form of
wrestling.
<P></P>
Wormlike and snakelike creatures are resistant to wrestling damage, but can be
held or locked so they cannot attack until they win free of the hold.
Creatures immune to normal weapons have a natural resistance to wrestling attacks, so
they can be grappled or pinned but take no damage from a hold unless the
attacker functions as a magical weapon. Immunity to normal weapons, however, does not
protect a creature from the effects of a lock, including damage.
<P></P>
Wrestling requires both hands free. Shields, which are normally worn strapped
to the forearm, interfere with the character's grip and prevent wrestling.
<P></P>
Wrestling combat always takes place between two opponents; multiple attackers
cannot make a wrestling attack as a group. Damage from wrestling holds and
locks is mostly temporary, just like other types of brawling damage.
