How players use this handbook depends upon their skill level, seriousness
about the bard character class, and their relationship with their Dungeon Master.
<P></P>
Skilled players who are serious about role-playing bard characters will want
to read this book closely. Those who are not as serious will find the table of
contents (in the front of this book) and the index (in the back) to be
invaluable in locating topics of interest.
<P></P>
A new bard character record sheet is located at the back of this handbook. It
has been custom-tailored to the bard character class. You will find spaces to
place every detail of your bard. Furthermore, the sheet has been laid out with
numerous helpful notes, comments, and formats to provide you with a plethora of
information without referring to the rule books. You may photocopy the sheet
for your own personal use.
<P></P>
For those of you who wish to create new bard kits, a handy kit creation sheet
is also bound into the back of this book. This may also be photo copied for
personal use.
<P></P>
It is not necessary for you to read this book from cover to cover unless you
wish to be the ultimate bard role-player. Instead, locate the section you wish
to explore in greater detail and read it to your own satisfaction.
<P></P>
A major effort has been made to make this handbook complete, as its title
states. Many of the rules specific to bards in both the <I>Player's Handbook</I> and <I>DUNGEON MASTER</I> <I>Guide</I> have been complied and condensed within this handbook. Also contained herein
is the information needed to generate a bard and maintain him during level
advancements. The commonly asked questions about standard bards have been attended
to, along with rules clarifications where needed. The bard class has also been
fully defined for all to see. The fine points of the class have been examined,
illuminated, and made more accessible. Finally, there are many added details
concerning role-playing, including the bard personality, reputation, and role as
a performer.
