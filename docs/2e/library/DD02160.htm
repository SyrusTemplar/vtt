This spell enables the priest to call upon a tiny (size T) creature of at
least animal intelligence to act as his messenger. The spell does not affect giant
animals and it does not work on creatures of low (i.e., 5) Intelligence or
higher. If the creature is within range, the priest, using some type of food
desirable to the animal as a lure, can call the animal to come. The animal is allowed
a saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is failed, the animal advances
toward the priest and awaits his bidding. The priest can communicate with the
animal in a crude fashion, telling it to go to a certain place, but directions
must be simple. The spellcaster can attach some small item or note to the animal.
If so instructed, the animal will then wait at that location until the
duration of the spell expires. (Note that unless the intended recipient of a message
is expecting a messenger in the form of a small animal or bird, the carrier may
be ignored.) When the spell's duration expires, the animal or bird returns to
its normal activities. The intended recipient of a message gains no
communication ability.
