<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This is the fastest and most straightforward. There are no decisions to make
while rolling the dice, and dice rolling is kept to a minimum. Ability scores
range from 3 to 18, but the majority fall in a range from 9 to 12.
<P></P>
Typically, a character will have four scores in the average range, one
below-average score, and one above-average score. A few lucky players will get several
high scores and a few unlucky ones will get just the opposite.
<P></P>
Very high scores are rare, so character classes that require high scores
(paladin, ranger, illusionist, druid, bard) are correspondingly rare. This makes
characters who qualify for those classes very special indeed. The majority of the
player characters will be fighters, clerics, mages, and thieves. Characters
with exceptional ability scores will tend to stand out from their comrades.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Method I Disadvantages:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">First, some players may consider their characters to be hopelessly average.
Second, the players don't get many choices.
<P></P>
Using method I, only luck enables a player to get a character of a particular
type, since he has no control over the dice. Most characters have little choice
over which class they become: Only one or two options will be open to them.
You might let players discard a character who is totally unsuitable and start
over.
