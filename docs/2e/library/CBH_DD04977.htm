The ability to pick pockets extends far beyond reaching into a victim's
coat pocket and removing its contents. It has many other applications, as listed
below. Some of these applications can be reversed and are indicated below. For
example, &quot;Redo&quot; is the opposite of &quot;Undo.&quot;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Undo/Redo: A bard can untie, unstring, unclasp, unbuckle, unbutton, etc., an
item without being noticed.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Palm/Place: Palming enables a bard's hand to be held naturally while looking
empty, but it actually contains some item: cards, a dagger, a scroll,
silverware, coins (up to 10 + 2/level), gems (up to 5 + 1/level), etc.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Lift/Drop: Lifting is the art of removing small items from others' pockets,
sleeves, girdles, packs, <I>etc</I>., without the victims noticing.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Strip/Garb: If a bard removes any accessible item (small or large) from a
sleeping person (swords, boots, hat, and so on) without waking the victim, he is
stripping items from the victim.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Sleight of Hand: This is a general category that enables a bard to transfer an
item from one hand to another, make the item seem alive, make it vanish and
reappear, cause it to appear behind another's ear, and so on.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Adjust Items: This skill enables a bard to make subtle adjustments without
being noticed. For example, a bard could slip a peg from hole 1 of some game into
hole 2.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Exchange: Exchange enables a bard to reach into a pile of coins and remove
more than he places there or to drop in a gold but remove a platinum.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Slit: Slitting is the art of cutting through straps or cutting holes in bags,
garments, purses, pouches, <I>etc</I>., without being noticed.

Most of these pick pockets functions can be reversed. So doing requires a
successful pick pockets roll. An example follows.
<P></P>
While enjoying a fancy dinner party, the bard, Rembam, may wish to frame the
good cleric Baldwin as a thief. To do so he might undo Madam Morgava's necklace,
lift it from her, then drop it in Baldwin's pocket (this process requires
three pick pockets rolls).
<P></P>
Later Rembam could alter the topic of discussion to that of jewelry, causing
Madam Morgava to notice her missing necklace. As soon as a large stir is made,
Rembam might exclaim, &quot;I noticed the good cleric here was doting over your
person earlier. Perhaps we should ask him to empty his pockets.&quot;
<P></P>
<B>Success/Failure/Detection:</B> If a bard rolls equal to or below his pick pockets score, he succeeds in the
attempt. If he rolls above his pick pockets score, he fails. However, success
and failure are separate from being detected. A bard's attempt to lift a gem
from a merchant's pocket might be detected regardless of whether the bard succeeds
in his attempt.
<P></P>
Detection is determined by subtracting three times the victim's (or
observer's) level from 100. If the bard's roll is equal to or above this number, his
attempt is detected (regardless of the attempt's success or failure).
