   An elite organization of land-owners, the Order of Crystal Dawn recognizes
business acumen and successful resource management. It provides investment advice
and low-interest loans to its members, and serves the community with charity
drives and financial counseling.
<P></P>
   Members of the order, having demonstrated financial responsibility throughout
their careers, are no longer bound by the paladin's stricture that forbids the
accumulation of wealth. However, members are still expected to use their wealth
for lawful good purposes, and are not allowed to acquire material possessions
merely for the pleasure of ownership.
<P></P>
   <B>Requirements:</B> A candidate must have a minimum Intelligence score of 10. He must also have
built a stronghold and held it for a decade; the stronghold must have generated
a profit for no less than seven of the 10 years. The value of his stronghold
and property must be at least 200,000 gp. Finally, he must pay an initiation fee
of at least 5,000 gp; he may pay a higher fee if he likes (the higher the fee,
the higher his endowment; see &quot;Benefits''). A paladin may save money for the
fee without violating his ethos.
<P></P>
<B>   Organization:</B> A chapter, consisting of 20 to 40 members, is governed by seven High Officers
known as Regents. Replacement Regents come from the rank and file, elected by
a vote of the active Regents. To qualify as a Regent, a member must have the
Law proficiency, and the net worth of his stronghold and property must have
doubled since he joined the order. The oldest Regent, called the Senior Regent,
chairs the meetings.
<P></P>
   The Regents handle the investment of the initiation funds and distribute
endowment income to eligible members. They also provide counseling, at no charge, to
any lawful good person in financial trouble. Though Regents are forbidden to
make loans to anyone other than members of the order, they may arrange loans
with established moneylenders and negotiate repayment plans with creditors.
<P></P>
   The Regents also mediate in legal disputes among paladins. Any paladin may
petition the Regents for a hearing, regardless of whether he's a member of the
order. The disputing parties must agree in advance to abide by the Regents'
decision. The Regents' decisions are considered legally binding by most lawful good
governments.
<P></P>
   All Regents have their names inscribed on a commemorative plaque, prominently
displayed on the stronghold wall of the order's Senior Regent.
<P></P>
<B>   Emblem:</B> A golden rising sun.
<P></P>
<B>   Motto:</B> &quot;Peace from prosperity.&quot;
<P></P>
<B>   Benefits:</B> By exchanging contacts and information, members can usually find sources of
goods and services costing 10-50% less than normal. After five years in the
order, a member becomes eligible for an annual endowment, generated from the
investments of his initiation fee made by the Regents. The endowment ranges from
20-50% of the fee (1d4+1 times 10%), paid every year. For instance, if a member
paid a 5,000 gp initiation fee, he earns an annual endowment ranging from 1,000 to
2,500 gp. The member must tithe from his endowment. Most members use the
remainder to improve their strongholds, add to their property, or make charitable
donations.
<P></P>
<B>   Dismissal:</B> A paladin dismissed from the order loses his endowment and forfeits his
initiation fee.
