are added to or subtracted from the initiative die roll.

<I> The DM decides that one initiative roll is sufficient for each group and no
modifiers are needed for either group. (Although Rath is charging, the orcs and
trolls are too busy rearranging their lines to be set to receive his charge and
so the -2 to receive charge is not used.)
<P></P>
Harry, rolling for the player characters, gets a 7 on a 10-sided die. The DM
rolls a 10. The player characters, having the lowest number, act first.
<P></P>
Delsenora's acid arrow strikes one of the trolls just as Rath takes a swing at
the last of the fleeing orcs. A bowshot from Rupert drops another one of the
creatures as it takes its position in the second rank. Now the monsters strike
back.
<P></P>
The orcs manage to finish forming their line. Enraged by the acid, the lead
troll tears into Rath, hurting him badly. The others swarm around him, attempting
to tear him limb from limb.
