Using the kits above as guidelines, many new kits can be created. If the DM
has a certain type of wizard that he would like in his world, he should design a
Wizard Kit for that personality. To design a Wizard Kit, the DM should consider
the following questions about the wizard and his role in the campaign.
<P></P>
<B>Description:</B> What's this wizard like? Is he drawn from a specific literary, mythological,
or historical source? Are there any special requirements for a character who
wishes to be this type of wizard?
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> What place does this wizard have in the campaign? How is he regarded by his
own culture? By other cultures? Is there a particular attitude or outlook he
needs to belong to this Wizard Kit?
<P></P>
What kinds of activities does this wizard tend to perform in a campaign-- is
he a bold man of action? A withdrawn scholar? An impulsive show-off? What is his
relationship with the other characters-- is he friendly, distanced, wary,
impassive?
<P></P>
<B>Preferred and Barred Schools:</B> Are there certain types of specialties that seem especially appropriate to
the wizards described in your kit? If so, note them as preferred schools. Are
there other specialists that seem particularly inappropriate to your kit? Note
them as barred schools.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> If using the Secondary Skills system, you need to decide if this Wizard Kit
requires such a skill. If there isn't a particular secondary skill or skills
common to all wizards of this type, then do not require a secondary skill. But if
all members of a Wizard Kit share the same skill-- or one of a small number of
skills-- then you might require it of all characters who take this kit.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Often, certain types of wizards tend to favor certain types of weapons.
Others select their weapons from a wide range of choices. If the wizard described in
your kit seems to prefer one or two weapons more than others, note this in the
kit. Keep in mind, however, that all wizards share certain weapon
restrictions-- see <A HREF="DD06192.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD06192.htm">Chapter 5</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> As with weapon proficiencies, many wizards tend to have certain skills in
common. For instance, it would be hard to imagine a Patrician who wasn't skilled
in Etiquette. Therefore, one or two nonweapon proficiency slots can be given
free of charge to characters taking this kit. If appropriate, the proficiencies
can come from the Priest, Rogue, and Warrior listings. Normally, the cost in
slots for non-wizard proficiences would be higher, but this can be ignored when
kits are being given free.
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> If a wizard is known for using certain types of equipment, require that such
a character have this equipment before the campaign begins. If some but not all
wizards of this type use the same equipment, then it needn't be required;
instead, simply list it as recommended equipment.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> Although not necessary, most Wizard Kits should have some special benefit.
Any kind of benefit is acceptable, but it should relate to the way this wizard
operates in fiction, mythology, or similar source material. Possible benefits
could include:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Bonuses to reaction rolls, particularly from certain categories of people.
Bonuses on wizard proficiency uses, especially in specifically defined situations.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Bonuses to hit and/or damage, especially against certain categories of
enemies, or in special circumstances.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Special resistances, such as an immunity or bonus to saving throws against
specific magical attacks or types of magic.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Special rights in the culture in which the character normally travels (such as
immunity from prosecution or free lodging on demand).
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> One or more special hindrances should be imposed which limit the character as
much as his special benefits help him. Possible hindrances include:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Penalties to reaction rolls, especially from certain categories of people.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Penalties to hit and/or damage, particularly against certain categories or
enemies, or in special circumstances.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Restrictions from learning certain nonweapon proficiencies.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Special restrictions in the culture in which the characters normally travel
(for instance, the wizard is prohibited from owning property or is punished
excessively for certain crimes).
<P></P>
<B>Wealth Options:</B> Does the wizard have less or more starting gold than other characters? Are
there any restrictions as to how his starting gold must be spent?
<P></P>
<B>Races:</B> Note any variations for wizards of specific races. Are any races barred from
the kit? Does any race receive special benefits, proficiencies, or hindrances
when taking this kit?
<P></P>
<B>Notes:</B> If there are any additional details about the kit, explain them fully. You
can also adapt kits to other classes by adjusting the skills, weapons,
proficiencies, benefits, and hindrances. A campaign might include Academician Priests or
Patrician Warriors
