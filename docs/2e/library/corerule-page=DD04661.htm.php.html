Dwarf merchants who trade mainly with other races, the Traders seek to drive
the hardest bargain they can. They usually deal in dwarven weapons, armor, and
other metal goods, but will trade in uncut gems, iron, or other ores when there
is a glut of them.
<P></P>
Traders transport their wares on mules or ponies, taking their goods to human
and elven towns or cities where they sell them to local merchants. Some traders
have established their own shops in such places, eliminating the middleman.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> They are often willing to travel vast distances in search of bargains. Some
Traders deal with the races of the Underdark, particularly deep gnomes, and
sometimes with drow or duergar. Others act as the only contact some mountain dwarf
strongholds have with the outside world. Traders are vital to the strongholds,
bringing in goods that local dwarves are unable to manufacture themselves.

Traders are adventurous by nature and are always looking for a good deal.
Entire campaigns may be based around the activities of a Trader and his companions,
transporting goods through hostile lands or in search of lost treasure.
