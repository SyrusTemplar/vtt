Recovering Spell Points
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Unless one of the optional systems of magic is in play for priestly magic,
spell points are regained just like spell capability in the standard AD&amp;D game. In
other words, if a character spends 10 spell points to memorize a major fixed
3rd-level spell, those points are “tied up” by holding the spell ready in the
character’s memory and can’t be used to memorize another spell until expended.
Spell points used to memorize free slots are also tied up in the same fashion.
<P></P>
Once a character casts a spell, the spell points used to hold that spell (or
slot) in memory are <I>gone</I>. The priest must rest for at least eight hours in order to regain spell
points expended through casting spells and spend about 10 minutes per spell level in
devout prayer to use those points to memorize new spells.
