<P></P>
<I>Description:</I> Buccaneers are thieves of the high seas, plying the trade lanes in search of
prey. They intermix with and complement their piratical warrior cousins...to
the extent that any of these scoundrels can be said to complement anything.
<P></P>
A hardy Constitution (no less than 10) is required to survive long months at
sea and be a Buccaneer.
<P></P>
<I>Role:</I> Buccaneers closely resemble their land-dwelling cousins, Bandits. They, too,
are desperate and cruel, fiendishly cunning, and likely to have a lot of
internal squabbles.
<P></P>
Like Bandits, Buccaneers cooperate for survival and success. They also have
sordid pasts—pasts which will often bind them together. Many a pirate ship used
to be put to legitimate use, but its crew rose in mutiny, took the ship, killed
everyone not party to the act, and turned to piracy.
<P></P>
Mutiny and piracy are both punishable by death, and on the high seas the
warship or merchantman of any state will gladly carry out that sentence, if given a
chance. Buccaneers will therefore fight to the death, against all odds, rather
than face capture and inevitable summary execution.
<P></P>
Buccaneers do not belong to guilds; although, like Bandits, a ship of them may
be considered a nonstandard guild of sorts. Sometimes groups of pirate and
Buccaneer ships will even make alliances, and cooperate to raid richly-laden (and
therefore well-defended) merchantmen. There may also be rivalry among pirate
groups—especially when one of them carries a healthy cargo of booty that has not
yet been hidden in a safe sanctuary.
<P></P>
Buccaneers like to have secret sanctuaries, probably in a secret cove or on a
tiny island. There they rest between raids, store treasure and provisions, and
plan their activities. Such sanctuaries will have the best protection available
to the Buccaneers, possibly including magical defenses.
<P></P>
Related to but distinct from Buccaneers are Privateers. These are &quot;legitimate&quot;
Buccaneers. Privateers have received the sanction of some nation to practice
piracy on the merchantmen of another nation. Well known historical examples of
this include the Privateers of Elizabethan England, captained by such
illustrious personages as Sir Francis Drake. These daring &quot;sea dogs&quot; raided gold-laden
Spanish galleons as they returned from the New World.
<P></P>
While Privateers are sanctioned by one nation, those on whom they prey
certainly regard them as pirates and will treat them as such if they are captured.
<P></P>
A group of NPC Buccaneers should include not just thieves but a healthy number
of warriors with the pirate kit, and perhaps a swashbuckler or two as well.
Even a renegade mage might be found among them. (Privateers are even more likely
to have the services of a wizard, especially one with talents in the
manipulation of water and wind.)
<P></P>
<I>Secondary Skills:</I> Gambler, Limner/Painter, Navigator, Sailor, Shipwright, Tailor/Weaver,
Teamster/Freighter, Trader/Barterer, Woodworker/Carpenter.
<P></P>
<I>Skill Progression:</I> Buccaneers make much less use of the traditional thief skills than thieves of
other kits. Climbing around the rigging of their ships requires some
wall-climbing skill, and the delicate step needed to work high above the deck may carry
over into excellence at moving silently. Finally, Buccaneers favor the read
languages skill—they like to be extraordinarily adept at deciphering the strange,
secret codes adorning maps, codes that may tell a sly captain the location of a
rival's buried treasure.
<P></P>
<I>Weapon Proficiencies:</I> The DM may wish to make classic Buccaneer weapons, such as the cutlass,
available to thieves of this kit.
<P></P>
<I>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</I> Required: Navigation, Seamanship, Swimming. Recommended: Alertness, Direction
Sense, Fishing, Gambling, Intimidation, Looting, Rope Use, Tightrope Walking,
Weather Sense.
<P></P>
<I> Equipment:</I> Buccaneers dress themselves as sailors (with weapons, of course), and carry
about the same equipment when at sea. Also, like sailors, they will avoid
armor—it gets in the way of climbing around the rigging (double penalties on climbing
rolls), and also presents a problem for someone unfortunate enough to find
himself overboard.
<P></P>
<I>Special Benefits:</I> Because of their familiarity with ropes, much used in the nautical arts,
Buccaneers gain a bonus of +5% on climbing rolls if ropes are involved—+10% if they
are ropes on a ship. (Note that the total chance of success with a thief
skill, including all positive and negative modifiers, cannot exceed 95%.)
<P></P>
Always be sure to consider the various climbing modifiers, explained on <A HREF="PHB_DD01782.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01782.htm">pp. 122-123</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> of the <I>Player's Handbook.
<P></P>
</I> Buccaneers also can fight from a rope (usually on a ship), so long as the feet
and one hand can grasp it, and they are much better at this than other types
of characters. They get +1 on attack and saving throw rolls in rope combat, +2
on such rolls in shipboard rope combat. Note that these adjustments should be
added to all the other modifiers—which are usually negative. For instance, a
climbing character would normally get a -2 penalty on attacks; so the Buccaneer's
+2 bonus merely negates this.
<P></P>
Use common sense when applying the saving throw bonus for a Buccaneer in rope
combat; while it would apply to dodging a lightning bolt, it would not apply to
saving against a charm or hold spell.
<P></P>
For more information on shipboard combat, see &quot;Learning the Ropes&quot; below.
<P></P>
Special Hindrances: As their expertise lies in rope-climbing, Buccaneers
suffer a penalty of -10% when they attempt to climb without one.
<P></P>
<I>Races:</I> Almost all Buccaneers are human, since few demihumans and humanoids are known
as seafarers. The occasional half-elf might be found among a Buccaneer crew,
or, even more rarely, a half-breed or full-blooded aquatic elf. For such an elf
to leave his own people would indicate a turbulent past indeed.

(Optional Rules)
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Buccaneers often find themselves fighting among the ropes and masts of their
ships. This section of optional rules is intended to help simulate the
difficulty and excitement of such a scenario. It may also be used in other situations of
rope combat.
<P></P>
The basic modifiers in climbing combat are as follows:
<P></P>
* A climbing character loses all Armor Class bonuses for Dexterity and shield.
<P></P>
* A climbing character suffers a -2 penalty on attack, damage, and saving
throw rolls.
<P></P>
* A character attacking from above gains a +2 bonus on his attack roll.
<P></P>
* A character attacking from below suffers a -2 penalty on his attack roll.
<P></P>
Other modifiers that often come into play are:
<P></P>
* An off-balance defender is attacked with a bonus of +2. See below for more
information on balance and rope combat.
<P></P>
* A rear attack (e.g., against a character trying to climb up a rope—but NOT a
Buccaneer climbing and dodging at the same time, as explained below) gains a
+2 bonus.
<P></P>
Buccaneers additionally gain a +1 on rope combat attacks (+2 if shipboard),
and may be given the option of dodging (explained below), thanks to their
facility and frequent practice with rope climbing.
<P></P>
NPC sailors, also familiar with seaborne rope climbing, should, for the
purpose of these rules, have a base climbing percentage of 65%. This percentage does
NOT apply to other sorts of climbing (walls, mountains, etc.); in such areas a
sailor is assumed to be untrained and should be treated as such.
<P></P>
Remember that modifiers are cumulative!
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Losing and Regaining Balance
<P></P>
</B>
<P></P>
Any character engaged in combat on ropes runs the risk of losing his balance.
<P></P>
A character who is struck by a weapon, or attempts to climb in the course of
combat, must make a climbing check or lose his balance.
<P></P>
Lost balance means that the next round the character must either fall
voluntarily or attempt to regain his balance. In either case, the character can perform
no other action. A successful climbing check means that the character has
regained his balance. A failure means the character has fallen (and, of course, may
suffer falling damage). Don't forget, all attacks against an off-balance
character are at +2.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Optional Rule: Dodging</B>
<P></P>
<P></P>
Thieves with the Buccaneer kit may choose to spend a round in rope combat
dodging. When doing so, the thief may not attack, but he may move at half his
normal rope-climbing speed. If a successful climbing check is made, the Buccaneer is
able to add his Dexterity bonus to his Armor Class for that round of combat.
If unsuccessful, the thief will be off-balance the next round; he must spend it
regaining his balance (see below), and attacks against him are at +2.
<P></P>
<I> Example: </I>While plying the sea lanes, a ship carrying the Buccaneer Daljo assaults a
merchantman whose crew refuses the Buccaneers' demand for their cargo and puts up
a surprising amount of resistance. Daljo and his men board the vessel, and he
finds himself fighting high above the deck, facing an ugly sailor armed with a
long, curved dagger. Daljo himself wields a cutlass. Neither combatant is
wearing armor.
<P></P>
The modifiers for this melee are as follows: Neither gets a Dexterity bonus;
since they are both unarmored, they both have AC 10. The sailor's attack
modifiers are -2 for climbing, but +2 for attacking from above, so they balance out to
zero. Daljo has -2 for climbing, +3 for being a Buccaneer climbing ropes on a
ship, and -2 for attacking from below, for a total penalty of -1.
<P></P>
In one round of combat, suppose Daljo is struck by the sailor's knife. He must
roll his climbing percentage to avoid losing his balance. His base percentage
is 75%; but thanks to his kit and the situation he gets a +10% bonus. If an 85
or lower is rolled, Daljo hangs on in spite of the situation.
<P></P>
But suppose he is unsuccessful: Daljo has lost his balance. The next round his
action is to attempt to regain it (the only alternative is to drop to the
deck), which he succeeds in doing, while the sailor strikes with a +2 bonus. If
Daljo is struck again, he will have to make another climbing check lest he lose
another round of attacks or even plummet to the deck below.
<P></P>
If the combat continues to go poorly, Daljo should probably dodge blows while
retreating down the rope. The sailor has the advantage when above him, but once
Daljo has returned safely to the deck, he can fight on an even footing again.
If the sailor does not follow him down, however, he should not go too far—lest
the sailor try to cut the rope above him!
