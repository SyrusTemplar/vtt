<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>Witch</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Description:</B> The Witch is a wizard whose
powerful magical abilities are extraplanar in origin. Though wizards
typically learn the basics of spellcasting at magic academies or from
learned mentors, Witches learn magical skills from entities and their
minions from other planes of existence, or from other Witches.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Occasionally, these extraplanar entities contact
youthful humans or demihumans for magical instruction; other times,
humans and demihumans seek out the entities through arcane rituals
and petition them for instruction. The entities agree to such
instruction for a variety of reasons-- some hope to train their
students to eventually become emissaries; some hope to use them as
conduits for various forces; some hope to seduce them as consorts;
and some simply share their magical secrets for their own amusement.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Whatever the motives of the extraplanar entities, they
exude a powerful directing influence over their students. However, a
few Witches with particularly strong wills are able to maintain their
own drives while using their magical skills to further their own
goals. Such Witches face a life-long struggle with the forces who
relentlessly strive to direct their spirits.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The requirements for becoming a Witch are higher than
for any other kit. Because her training is more demanding than that
received by most other wizards, she must have a minimum Intelligence
and Wisdom of 13. To resist the corruption inherent from contact with
extraplanar entities, she must have a minimum Constitution of 13. The
vast majority of Witches are female, but male Witches are also
possible, commonly called Warlocks.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The Witch kit cannot be abandoned. If a Witch manages
to sever all ties with the entities responsible for her instruction
(usually requiring the power of a<I> wish</I> or its equivalent), she
loses two experience levels. If she still wishes to pursue a magical
career, she must relearn the experience levels that she lost.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Preferred Schools:</B> The most appropriate school
for Witches is enchantment/charm. Conjuration/summoning and
necromancy are also good choices.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Barred Schools:</B> There are no barred schools for Witches.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Role:</B> Regardless of her actual alignment, all
but her closest friends are likely to presume that a Witch is in
collaboration with extraplanar spirits, and will shun her
accordingly. There are few places where a Witch is welcome, and for
the most part, a Witch will need to conceal her identity when
traveling to assure her safety.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">A Witch's player character companions need not have
such fears or prejudices against her, especially after she proves
herself in life-and-death situations. However, there might always be
a veil of suspicion between the Witch and her companions, as if they
cannot quite bring themselves to trust her completely. Any player
characters with suspicious natures, particularly those with primitive
or unsophisticated backgrounds, may never fully warm up to a Witch
and will avoid being alone with her, sometimes even accusing her of
betraying the party or bringing them bad luck. (The DM is free to
encourage this type of role-playing, but not to the point of
disrupting the campaign. If this distrust becomes problematic, the DM
might remind the PC leader of the party that the Witch is indeed a
good-aligned character and it is his job to promote good will among
his companions.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Although a Witch learns her magical techniques from
extraplanar entities, once on her own, she learns her spells in much
the same way as any other wizard. Still, her techniques for casting
spells may differ significantly from the standard methods. The
casting times, ranges, and effects of her spells are no different
from the same spells used by other wizards, but she may use different
verbal, somatic, or material components, as well as meditation. These
differences should make her seem even more threatening to outsiders,
as well as making her seem more remote to the other player characters.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Secondary Skills:</B> Required: None. Recommended: Scribe.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Weapon Proficiency:</B> The Witch is not allowed an
initial Weapon Proficiency, nor can she acquire a Weapon Proficiency
as she advances in level.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Nonweapon Proficiency:</B> Bonus Proficiencies:
Herbalism, Spellcasting. Recommended: (General) Artistic Ability,
Brewing, Cooking, Languages (Modern), Weather Sense; (Wizard) Ancient
History, Astrology, Languages (Ancient), Reading/Writing, Religion;
(Priest, double slot) Healing.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Equipment:</B> When a Witch is first created, she
must buy her weapons from among the following choices: Dagger or
dirk, knife, sling, staff sling. Additionally, the Witch can choose
up to 1,500 gp worth of magical items from </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="DMG_DD00675.htm">Table
89</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> (Potions and Oils), </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="DMG_DD00677.htm">Table

95</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">- 103 (Miscellaneous Magic) on
pages 135-139 of the <I>Dungeon Master's Guide</I>. These items are
free-- she doesn't have to pay for them (but she cannot keep any of
the leftover 1,500 gp).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Special Benefits:</B> When a Witch is initially
created, she automatically gains the spells <I>detect magic</I> and<I>
read magic</I>; these spells are in addition to any spells she
normally receives. As a Witch increases in level, she automatically
gains the following abilities. These are all naturally acquired
abilities, and do not count against the number of spells she can know
or use. All of the following abilities can be used once per week.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>3rd Level:</B> The Witch acquires the ability to <I>secure
familiar</I>. This is identical to the 1st-level wizard spell<I>
find familiar</I>, except that a Witch does not need to burn 1,000 gp
worth of incense and herbs in a brass brazier. Instead, the Witch
must merely concentrate for one turn. If a suitable familiar is
within 1 mile per level of the Witch, it will arrive within 1d10
hours. A Witch can have only one familiar at a time.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>5th Level:</B> The Witch acquires the ability to <I>brew
calmative</I>. Assuming she has access to the proper ingredients
(usually available in any forest), the Witch can brew one dose of an
elixir that has the effect of a <I>sleep</I> spell when a victim
comes in contact with it. One dose is sufficient to coat a sword or
any other single weapon. The elixir has no effect on victims with
more than 8 HD; victims can resist the effects of the elixir with a
successful saving throw.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The Witch requires one hour to brew the elixir. The
elixir loses its potency after 24 hours.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>7th Level:</B> The Witch acquires the ability to <I>brew
poison</I>. With the proper ingredients, available in most forests,
she can brew one dose of Class L contact poison sufficient to coat a
single weapon. The Witch requires one hour to brew the poison. It
loses its potency in 24 hours.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>9th Level:</B> The Witch acquires the ability to <I>beguile
</I>any single person or monster (assuming the person is no higher
than 8th-level or the monster has no more than 8 HD). <I>Beguile </I>is
identical to the 4th-level wizard spell charm monster and the 1st-level
wizard spell <I>charm person</I>, except that the victim is not
allowed a saving throw. To cast <I>beguile</I>, the Witch must merely
point at the victim and concentrate for 1 round; there are no verbal
or material components.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>11th Level:</B> The Witch acquires the ability to <I>brew
flying ointment</I>. Assuming she has access to the proper
ingredients (usually available in any forest), the Witch can brew one
dose of an ointment which, when rubbed on the skin, gives the
recipient the ability to fly, as per the 3rd-level wizard spell<I> fly</I>.
The dose is sufficient to affect one human-sized subject; the
effects persist until the ointment loses its potency 24 hours after
it is brewed. The Witch requires one hour to brew the ointment.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>13th Level:</B> The Witch acquires the ability to
inflict a <I>witch's curse</I> on any single person or creature. This
is exactly identical to the 4th-level wizard spell <I>bestow curse</I>,
except that its effect is automatic; the victim is not allowed a
saving throw. The effect of the curse persists for 24 hours unless
the curse is dispelled by a<I> remove curse, wish</I>, or similar
spell. To cast the spell, the Witch must merely point at the victim
and concentrate for 1 round; no verbal or material components are
required. To determine the effects of <I>witch's curse</I>, roll 1d8
and consult Table 8.</FONT></P>

</TABLE></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Special Hindrances:</B> Because of their
non-conventional training, Witches do not earn bonuses to their
experience for high ability scores. Witches cannot be multi-classed
or dual-classed.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Generally, outsiders are terrified of Witches. Unless
an NPC is exceptionally open-minded or has extremely high
Intelligence or Wisdom (13 or more in either ability), the Witch
receives a -3 reaction roll. If the NPC is uneducated, comes from an
extremely superstitious or unsophisticated culture, or has low
Intelligence and Wisdom (under 10 for both), the Witch receives a -5
reaction roll. Additionally, if a Witch lingers in a superstitious or
culturally unsophisticated community for more than a day, she runs
the risk of facing a mob of hostile citizens bent on running her out
of town, imprisoning her, torturing her, or executing her. (The DM
decides the size of the mob, their intentions, and the likelihood of
their accosting the Witch. As a rule of thumb, assume a 20 percent
chance of a 4d6-member mob forming in a hostile community if the
Witch stays for a day. This chance increases by 20 percent for every
additional day the Witch remains; the size of the mob increases by
2d6 members.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The Witch must periodically struggle with the
extraplanar forces striving to direct her. The forces are so powerful
that they cannot be dispelled; all the Witch can do is endure them.
When undergoing these internal struggles, the Witch suffers penalties
to her combat abilities and saving throws.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The DM has three options for determining the frequency
and intensity of these penalties, depending on the needs of his
campaign and how much bookkeeping he is willing to undertake:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">1. The Witch suffers a -2 penalty to her attack rolls
and a -2 penalty to her saving throws on any night with a full moon
and the three nights before and after the full moon (the penalties
apply to a 12 hour period from about 6 p. m. to 6 a. m. ). On most
worlds, a full moon will occur about once per month; if the moon of
the DM's world has a shorter or longer cycle, increase or decrease
the number of nights the Witch is affected; she should be affected
about seven nights out of 4 weeks. If there are several moons, the
Witch is affected by only one of them.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">2. There is a 25 percent chance per day that the Witch
will be subjected to an internal struggle with extraplanar forces.
The DM determines this at the beginning of the day; the Witch is
aware of the result. Throughout that night (a 12-hour period lasting
from about 6 p. m. to 6 a. m. ), the Witch suffers a -2 penalty to
her attack rolls and a -2 penalty to her saving throws.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">3. The Witch struggles with the extraplanar forces
every night. For a 12- hour period lasting from about 6 p. m. to 6 a.
m. , she suffers a -1 penalty to her attack throws; there is no
penalty to her saving throws.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Wealth Options:</B> The Witch receives the standard
(1d4+1) x 10 gp as starting money.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Races:</B> No racial restrictions.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Note:</B> The Witch is among the most complex of
all the kits, and many of the details are left up to the player's
discretion. For instance, he may wish to design specific daily
rituals for his Witch, or he may wish to expand on the Witch's
relationship with the entities who originally trained her. What
exactly are they? Where are they? Can the Witch contact them for
favors? What exactly happens if the forces succeed in controlling the
Witch? Does her alignment change? Her abilities? Her relationship to
the party? There are many possible variations on the Witch kit, and
the DM is encouraged to experiment, as long as he avoids the
temptation to make her excessively powerful, and keeps in mind the
potential disruptions in his campaign.</FONT></P>
