By means of this potent spell, the priest summons many ranks of skeletons to
do his bidding. The skeletons are formed from any and all humanoid bones within
the area of effect. The number of skeletons depends on the terrain in the area
of effect; a battlesite or graveyard will yield 10 skeletons per 100 square
yards; a long-inhabited area will yield three skeletons per 100 square yards; and
wilderness will yield one skeleton per 100 square yards.
<P></P>
The spell's maximum area of effect is 10,000 square yards. Thus, no more than
1,000 skeletons can be summoned by this spell.
<P></P>
The skeletons created by this spell are turned as zombies and remain in
existence until destroyed or willed out of existence by the priest who created them.
