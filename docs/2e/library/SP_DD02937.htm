The profession of thief is not a particularly honorable one. However, many
famous folk heroes have been thieves, robbing from the corrupt and wealthy and
giving to the poor and hungry. The thief can be a romantic figure, even a
swashbuckling one. Examples are Oliver Twist, Hanse Shadowspawn, Ali Babba, Aladdin,
and Bilbo Baggins.
<P></P>
Thieves are limited in their selection of weapons to: club, dagger, dart, hand
crossbow, knife, lasso, short bow, sling, broad sword, long sword, short
sword, and staff.
<P></P>
Thieves receive 80 character points to spend on skills from the following
list. Skills cost 5 to 15 points. Any unspent points can be used to acquire
nonweapon proficiencies or saved for use during the game. Many of the skills can be
improved as thieves advance levels. This is explained after the skill section.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Skills marked with an asterisk (*) can be improved as a thief advances in
level. Refer to the appropriate table.

<A NAME="89c063ff"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Detect illusion* (10):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Thieves can see detect illusions within their line of sight, up to 90 feet
away. They perceive the illusion as a translucent image, seeing through it as
though it were a light mist.
<P></P>
<A NAME="953c29b4"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Detect magic* (10):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Thieves can spot magical radiations within their line of sight, up to 60 feet

strong, and overwhelming.
<P></P>
<A NAME="f123be91"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Detect noise* (5):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This is the ability to hear sounds others usually can-t.
<P></P>
<A NAME="b0c22709"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Escaping bonds* (10):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> There comes a time in every thief-s career when his luck runs out and the he
is apprehended. The ability to escape bonds such as ropes, leather thongs,
manacles, chains, and even straight jackets is a feat of contortion and
determination. The thief must roll to break every device binding him. If he-s tied at the
wrists and at the ankles, then he must make two successful rolls to free
himself. This skill takes five rounds to use. A thief might hurry his efforts, but he
suffers a ?5% penalty for each round he tries to shave. Locked items also
require the thief to successfully pick the locks. A failure on any attempt means
that the thief cannot loose that bond or pick the lock.
<P></P>
<A NAME="d61c16de"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Find/remove traps* (10):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Many people try to protect their important belongings from thieves with small
mechanical traps or alarms. As a result, thieves have developed skills to find
and disarm these traps.
<P></P>
<A NAME="9d5bf17e"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Followers (5/10):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> By purchasing this skill, a thief can gain followers as described in the <I>Player-s Handbook</I> if he establishes a stronghold and is at least 10th level. If this is
purchased as a 10-point ability, the thief can attract followers whenever he
establishes a stronghold, regardless of level. Refer to the thief section of the <A HREF="PHB_DD01500.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="PHB_DD01500.htm">Player-s Handbook</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> for more details on followers.
<P></P>
<A NAME="8d71795b"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hide in shadows* (5):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A thief can attempt to disappear in shadows, bushes, and crannies. A
successful thief will be effectively invisible as long as he remains all but
motionless. Slow, deliberate movements are allowed.
<P></P>
<A NAME="9a9d502b"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Move silently* (5):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This is the ability to move without making noise. The movement rate of a
thief attempting this is reduced to 1/3 his normal rate.
<P></P>
<A NAME="57e36f71"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Open locks* (10):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A thief can try to pick all types of locks using skill, tools, finesse, and
luck. If a thief fails to open a lock, he cannot attempt to open that lock again
until advancing a level.
<P></P>
<A NAME="2c856baa"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Pick pockets* (10):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A thief uses this skill to pilfer small items from the pouches, pockets,
belts, sleeves, packs, etc. of others. A failed attempt means the thief did not
come away with an item, but it does not indicate the thief was caught in the act.
To determine if a thief-s attempt was noticed, subtract three times the
victim-s experience level from 100. If the thief-s roll was equal to or higher than
this number, the attempt was noticed. For example, if the thief tried to pick the
pocket of a 5th level fighter and failed-and the thief-s roll was 85 or
higher-the thief is noticed. (5x3 = 15. 100?15 = 85.)
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Read languages* (5):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A thief needs every edge he can get, and the ability to read languages can
help.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Scroll use (5/10):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> At 10th level, a thief can use magical spell scrolls. By purchasing this
skill as a 10-point ability, he has a chance to read scrolls at any level. If a
thief fails to accurately read the scroll, usually something detrimental occurs,
such as the spell backfiring. Consult <A HREF="DD02940.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02940.htm">Table 25</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> for the thief-s chance to read a scroll:

<A NAME="23862409"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Thieves? cant (5):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Thieves use slang terms when referring to their illegal operations. This lets
them converse about such dealings in the open without others knowing what they
are talking about.
<P></P>
<A NAME="34cd28b6"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Tunneling* (10):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A thief might need to dig a tunnel to get to a cache of riches. His success
at tunneling depends on several factors. The <A HREF="DD02941.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02941.htm">tunneling table</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> below shows the time required to dig through 10 feet of earth with adequate
tools. Every 10 feet, the thief must make a skill check, failure meaning that
the front of the tunnel collapses. It can be re-dug at the loose earth rate.
<P></P>
<A NAME="c5a7aad0"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon specialization (15): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This thief can specialize in a particular weapon. The character point cost for
gaining proficiency and specialization in the weapon must be met in addition.

abilities based on race, Dexterity, and armor or lack thereof.
