</B>Requirements
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> To create a magical item, a character needs the appropriate level of skill, a
suitable place to perform the work, the correct materials and processes to
complete the item, and often the <I>enchant an item</I> and <I>permanency</I> spells.
<P></P>
<P></P>

<P></P>
Wizards can create potions and scrolls at 9th level and other items at 11th
level, provided that the necessary spells are available.
<P></P>
Priests can create scrolls at 7th level, potions at 9th level, and other items
at 11th level.
<P></P>
Warriors and rogues cannot create magical items, even if they have
spellcasting ability.
<P></P>
Priests and wizards can use spells on scrolls, stored in items, or cast by
other characters to get the spells necessary to create magical items.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Who Can Make Which Items?</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
No character can make a magical book, libram, manual, tome, or artifact.
Artifacts are a campaign-shaking occurrence, reserved to the discretion of the DM.
Magical writings that increase levels and ability scores are likewise
unbalancing.
<P></P>
Racial items, such as <I>boots of elvenkind</I> and <I>girdles of dwarvenkind</I>, can be created only by priests of the indicated race. High-level elf
priests, for example, can create <I>cloaks of elvenkind</I>. If the <I>Exceeding Level Limits</I> optional rule (from the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00224.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00224.htm.php.html">DMG</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">) is not in play, only NPC demihuman clerics who have achieved the maximum
level can make these items.
<P></P>
Mages can make any other item if they meet the level requirements and have the
necessary spells.
<P></P>
Priests and specialist wizards can make only those items that they can use. A
cleric, for example, cannot make a magical long sword, and a transmuter can’t
make a <I>wand of fire</I>, which employs evocation magic. Specialist wizards, however, receive a +5%
bonus to their success chances when creating items that possess abilities from
their school of specialization. For example, a transmuter gets the bonus when
creating a <I>wand of polymorphing</I>.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Working Space</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
A wizard needs a laboratory to make magical items. The laboratory must have at
least 500 square feet of floor space (20 x 25 feet), and more is preferable.
Basic furnishings and supplies cost 5,000 gp, and the character must spend an
additional 500 gp a month to keep the laboratory properly equipped.
<P></P>
A priest must create magical items on an altar specially dedicated to his
deity. There is no basic size requirement, although a deity whose portfolio
includes magic might impose one. An item to be enchanted must fit on the altar, so it
benefits the priest to make the altar as large and sturdy as is practical. The
minimum cost for building the altar and properly consecrating it is 2,000 gp.
The altar requires no special maintenance, but only the priest who performed the
consecration can use the altar to enchant items—no other creature can use it
while the priest lives. If the altar is defiled, the priest must consecrate it
again. Before consecrating the altar, the priest must please his deity with some
extraordinary service connected with the deity’s portfolio or sphere of
control. A deity of wisdom, for example, might look favorably upon a priest who
writes a book of philosophy or who solves a mystery using superior judgment instead
of divination spells.
<P></P>
After the service is complete, the priest must pray and meditate over the
altar for one week. The vigil occupies all the character’s waking hours. If
interrupted, the vigil must be started over again.
<P></P>

<P></P>
Characters who have the required skills and equipment are not necessarily free
to begin churning out magical items as they see fit. The DM must approve any
new magical item that enters the campaign. The player should explain exactly
what powers the proposed item will have. In the case of items already described in
rule books, this is simply a matter of having the DM review the description
and decide if the item is appropriate to the campaign. Once approved, the player
is free to have the character begin work.
