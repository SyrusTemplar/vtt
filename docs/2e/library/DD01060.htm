<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Talisman of the Sphere:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This is a small adamantite loop and handle which will be useless to
nonwizards. Characters of any other class touching a talisman of this sort will suffer
5d6 points of damage. When held by a wizard concentrating on control of a <I>sphere of annihilation,</I> a <I>talisman of the sphere</I> doubles the Intelligence bonus percentage for control (i.e., 2% per point of
Intelligence from 13-15, 6% per point of Intelligence from 16-18).
<P></P>
If control is established by the wielder of a talisman, he need check for
continual control only every other round thereafter. If control is not established,
the sphere will move toward the wizard at maximum speed (16 feet/round). Note
that a <I>wand of negation</I> will have no effect upon a <I>sphere of annihilation,</I> but if the wand is directed at the talisman it will negate its power of
control as long as the wand is directed at it.
