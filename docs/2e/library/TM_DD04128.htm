The introduction of new priest spheres can pose a logical problem in some
campaigns--if an existing Power has influence in a certain sphere, why did his
priests never have these spells before? Why do they wake up one morning and
suddenly have access to spells never before seen?
<P></P>
The DM can use several solutions to this question. The first is most effective
for such esoteric spheres as Thought and Numbers. In this case, few (if any)
existing Powers have access to these spheres. Instead, priests arrive (as did
wild mages) from distant lands, spreading the word of their god. These NPC
priests have strange powers never before seen. In some locations, they may be
accepted, while in others, they may be driven out with vengeance. As new player
characters are created, this &quot;new&quot; faith with all its advantages and disadvantages
becomes an option.
<P></P>
Another explanation, particularly useful for the spheres of War and Wards, is
that the Power always had access to these spells, but never had the need to
grant them. A deity of war could reasonably withhold spells of the War sphere
until the threat of war exists. To introduce the War sphere into the campaign, the
DM need only create a little border tension and massing of troops -- the
perfect background for many adventures.
<P></P>
Certain deities may be too aloof or remote to become involved in the affairs
of men until the need arises. This is particularly appropriate for the spheres
of Law and Chaos. A shift in the &quot;harmony of the universe&quot; might warrant the
attention of these Powers to &quot;set things right.&quot;
<P></P>
The introduction of subdivisions in the elemental sphere can be effected in a
similar manner. Foreign priests may enter the campaign region and introduce the
concept, or existing priests might discover their own deities suddenly taking
a more active interest in their spells. Conflict or rivalry on the elemental
planes can be used to justify rigid adherence to a particular element. A fire
god, feeling the rising power of a sea god, may enforce strict elemental selection
to bolster the devotion of his priests.
<P></P>
Of all the new priest material, quest spells are the easiest to introduce.
These are given by the DM only when special conditions warrant. It is easy to
justify that conditions have never yet warranted the need for quest spells.
