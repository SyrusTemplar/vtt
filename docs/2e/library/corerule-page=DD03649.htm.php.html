<FONT SIZE="3">This spell makes a single weapon incredibly sharp by
reducing one of its physical dimensions to an infinitesimal
measurement. The <I>dimensional blade </I>can slash through matter
with as much effort as it takes to wave a stick through the air. Even
stone and iron can be carved to pieces with ease. The spell can be
cast on almost any hand-held slashing (type S) weapon, as well as a
few thrown weapons of this type, such as the chakram, shuriken, or a
hand axe.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Against creatures, the <I>dimensional blade </I>ignores
any portion of Armor Class derived from armor itself; only magical
and Dexterity adjustments affect the opponent&#146;s AC. For example,
a warrior in <I>chain mail +2 </I>with a Dexterity of 17 is normally
AC 0, but against the dimensional blade he only applies the 3-point
adjustment for Dexterity and the 2-point magical adjustment, for a
total AC of 5. Creatures wearing purely magical armor (such as <I>bracers
of defense</I>) may keep the full magical adjustment. Monsters with
thick or toughened hides, such as dragons, may lose part of the Armor
Class at the DM&#146;s discretion. The weapon gains a +2 bonus to
attack and damage rolls in any event, but the wielder ignores any
Strength-based combat adjustments&#151;muscle power doesn&#146;t help
the blade at all.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The <I>dimensional blade </I>is also quite effective
against inanimate objects. Any object with a diameter or thickness
smaller than the blade&#146;s length must make a saving throw vs.
disintegration when struck, or be cleanly severed in twain. Larger
objects can be sawed through or sliced away at the rate of about 5
cubic feet per round. It&#146;s dangerous to attempt to disarm a <I>dimensional
blade</I>; the weapon used must make an item saving throw vs.
disintegration or be destroyed.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Finally, the blade is also effective against phased or
ethereal creatures since part of its existence is forced into the
Ethereal Plane. If the wielder has some way to detect creatures
concealed in this way, the blade can strike and affect them normally,
but without the power to negate Armor Class or other combat bonuses.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The wizard must touch the weapon to be affected by the
spell, but afterward anyone may wield it. The material component for
this spell is a razor-thin shard of glass.</FONT></P>
