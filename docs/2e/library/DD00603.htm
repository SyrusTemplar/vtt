If player characters have the nerve to ask NPCs (not hirelings or henchmen) to
use up valuable magical items or charges from these, they are going to get a
very cold reaction. Consider how often player characters sell or give away the
magic items they find during their adventures. Nonplayer characters will have
about the same likelihood of selling (or giving!) powerful magic away. Offering
to buy a charge from a <I>staff of healing</I> is just plain insulting. No NPC's reaction is going to be improved by the
offer.
