<P></P>
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The beliefs and ethics of druids cover two main areas: keeping the balance
between the alignments and serving as guardians of Nature. When role-playing a
druid character, keep in mind that the character's behavior should reflect the
importance of these duties.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Keeper of the Balance
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Druids have seen that a balance between the forces of good and evil, law and
chaos, best fosters the continuance of life from one generation to the next.
This druidic duty is not so much a personal matter as the ethical responsibility
of the entire Order.
<P></P>
Only an event or threat of considerable magnitude can cause the balance to
tilt toward one alignment or another--a matter that could affect the destiny of
nations. Deciding that a menace of this degree exists and how best to handle it
is traditionally left to those of archdruid or higher rank, or the High Council
of the Moot. However, lesser druid PCs may decide they know better and take
action on their own!
<P></P>
Remember, keeping a balance doesn't spell stagnation. Druids view a slight
shift in the balance--like the ascendancy of one alignment--to be as natural as a
change in the weather. An individual druid may prefer a period of good (or of
law) just as one might prefer a warm summer day. But autumn and winter remain
just as necessary--in a world of eternal summer, the autumn harvest never comes.
<P></P>
But druids also believe in free will, and with free will comes the danger that
the balance will tilt too far in one direction. Many druids believe--rightly
or wrongly-- that powerful beings (gods and extraplanar entities) manipulate
mortals for just such an end: to see their own alignment or faith permanently
triumphant.
<P></P>
When druids perceive the balance tilting too far in any direction, the Order
becomes concerned. Some individual members may profess that the balance will
swing back by itself, regardless of the actions of mankind. Such druids
contentedly sit back and let events pass without taking action. A druid with this belief
would not make an interesting PC, although such a mindset gives the DM a good
excuse to have senior druids refuse to aid the player character!
<P></P>
But most druids do not share this belief. The majority see human and demihuman
races in general and the druidic order in particular as pivotal to maintaining
the cosmic balance. They look at the cycles of the world as driven by the
actions and machinations of mankind (and other intelligent races) and believe that,
as individuals play their part in the great cycle, they can also upset it.
<P></P>
This means that, when the cosmic balance is obviously in danger of being
tilted in favor of one alignment or faith, druids will ally themselves (openly or
covertly) with the opposing side. Normally an archdruid or great druid makes this
decision and devotes all energies to rallying the circle against the threat.
Sometimes a circle of druids becomes divided about the situation: Is it serious
enough to warrant intervention? The circle leaves it up to individual druids to
decide whether to offer assistance. However, keep in mind that druids who
frequently refuse to aid their circle's cause will find themselves unable to
attract help from senior druids when they need it.
<P></P>
Although the balance could swing too far in any direction, DMs should set
their campaigns at times when <I>evil</I> has grown alarmingly in strength, for such periods allow druid PCs to become
heroes. With the balance threatened by the power of evil, most druids find
themselves in the position to serve the cause of good willingly. This motivation is
good for the game, as it provides plenty of adventure for good-aligned PCs
while giving druids a chance to fight by their sides.
<P></P>
Similarly, in a game featuring the PCs as rebels or outlaws against authority,
the balance may have swung in favor of inflexible law. In such a case, druids
may side with the forces of chaos--good, neutral, and maybe even evil--in the
struggle of liberty against oppression.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Defense of the Wilderness
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The second major responsibility of druid characters is to defend the
wilderness and its wildlife. Players sometimes feel uncertain as to the limits of a
druid's concern for Nature, especially in regard to how druids treat those who make
a living hunting or farming.
<P></P>
Since all druids are charged with protecting natural wilderness, trees, wild
plants, wild animals, and crops, they also protect the people who follow druidic
beliefs, such as peasants and hunters living in harmony with Nature. (See the
Guardian and Village Druid kits, Chapter 2.)
<P></P>
Druids realize all creatures have basic needs for food, shelter, and
self-defense. Humans must hunt animals for food and must clear trees to farm and build
houses. These actions constitute a necessary part of the natural cycle. But
druids do not tolerate unnecessary destruction or exploitation of Nature. Sensing
violations, a druid investigates the motives of the people involved, weighing
them against the risk to the land. Then the druid decides whether to take action.
<P></P>
<B>Protecting Animals.</B> Only a very few druids (like those with the Pacifist kit) oppose hunting or
raising animals for food, skins, or fur. In fact, many druids hunt animals for
food and clothing themselves. They do frown upon killing animals simply for
sport, over-hunting (or over-trapping) a region, and treating animals with
excessive cruelty. And most druids do not even take this feeling to extremes. They know
that feudal nobles, for instance, enjoy the hunt; few such hunters are cruel
killers, and their game ends up on the lord's tables.
<P></P>
Druids oppose trapping or hunting beasts to use their fur or other body parts
for frivolous reasons. A hunter may kill a single wolf and take its pelt to
make a wolfskin cloak, according to druidic philosophy. If the hunter kills a
couple wolves every year and sells their pelts, a druid may or may not be upset,
depending on the prevalence of wolves in the area. But if a hunter regularly
traps dozens of wolves and makes a fortune selling their pelts to local merchants,
a druid will become angry and take action.
<P></P>
Even more than trapping for food or fur, druids hate to see animals captured
for use in events like bear baiting, bullfighting, or other such &quot;sports.&quot;
Druids always try to stop these spectacles and free the animals. They may wreak
terrible vengeance on those who capture wild beasts for sport or operate the arenas
where animals are forced to fight.
<P></P>
<B>Protecting Trees and Woodlands.</B> Druids have nothing against most forms of farming, even if it means clearing
woodlands or draining swamps to create new fields. Although druids feel a
special reverence for trees, crops are plants too, and civilized races have a right
to practice agriculture.
<P></P>
The druid may object to destroying a wilderness area for a farm extension that
is strictly for profit. For instance, clearing a forest for a large plantation
to grow cash crops--especially ones intended for pleasure, such as
tobacco--would raise a druid's ire.
<P></P>
A druid also will oppose farming that requires the destruction of ancient
wilderness areas, large spreads of land, or any region that serves as a sanctuary
for rare, endangered, or magical plants and animals. Most importantly, no druid
ever tolerates the destruction of a sacred grove! Druids also discourage
farming practices that harm the soil and selfish irrigation schemes (dams, aqueducts,
etc.) intended to parch one region to slake another's thirst.
<P></P>
Druids sometimes tolerate logging or clearing land to mine useful minerals
like salt, copper, tin, and iron. After all, they use manufactured items
themselves. Whether to accept such land use depends on the motives and need of those
involved and the nature of the region in question, just as with farming.
<P></P>
Cutting down a forest to build houses is one thing--especially if the builder
makes some effort at replanting. Using the wood to build a fleet of warships to
satisfy the ambitions of a tyrant is much less likely to find sympathy with
the druid. On the other hand, if the proposed fleet will oppose the invasion
force of a king whose conquests threaten to tip the balance of good and evil, some
druids may justify the forest's loss.
<P></P>
<B>Cleansing Nature.</B> Some acts defile the very essence of Nature and require immediate opposition.
For instance, the magical forced transformation of a large forest into a
bizarre, otherplanar landscape instantly draws the enmity of the circle. If a sacred
grove falls under a curse, druids will work to lift it and reclaim the land.
<P></P>
A more common perversion of Nature is the undead. The fact that no druidic
branch has the power to turn or control undead does <I>not</I> mean druids tolerate them. Rather, the druid's lack of power over the living
dead reflects the absolute aversion this class has toward them. Things exist in
a natural cycle: birth, growth, death, rebirth. The undead break this
cycle--worse, they are the enemies of life. Therefore, most druids see the undead as
abominations to stamp out to restore the proper workings of Nature.
<P></P>
Yet, druids do not actively hunt undead. This is primarily because undead
rarely directly invade a druid's sphere of interest. However, if a vampire starts
menacing a peaceful village, a banshee begins stalking the moors, or a lich
introduces a reign of terror to the wilderness, a druid may intervene. Because
druids lack the key powers necessary to fight undead (although their elemental
magic can prove useful), they will ally with a good-aligned party also interested
in wiping out the undead.
<P></P>
<B>Defending Croplands and Farmers.</B> A druid feels an obligation to protect farmers who worship Nature and to
safeguard fields and livestock. For details, see the <A HREF="DD05058.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD05058.htm">Village Druid kit</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> (Chapter 2) and the &quot;festivals&quot; section in this chapter.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Eyes in the Wilderness
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Defending an entire tract of wilderness and safeguarding the balance of forces
within it spells a <I>lot</I> of work for one druid. (In addition, sometimes druids are asked to give
reports on their section of the domain at moots.) Clearly, to do a good job, the
druid needs reliable sources of information and early knowledge of possible
threats.
<P></P>
Druids' own powers do go a long way in keeping them aware of the goings-on in
and near their area. The ability to pass without a trace and blend into the
woods allows druids to maintain watch on anyone entering the wild. Even better is
their shapechange power. Druids risk detection when using it, but very few
people--unless they know they have a druidic enemy--ever would suspect that a spy
lurks in the form of the mangy hound munching a bone under the lord's table or
the cat hiding under the bed. To infiltrate a foe's stronghold, druids often
assume the shape of a domestic animal, allowing themselves to be bought at market
or given as a gift--although those shapechanging into an edible animal should
take care to avoid the stew pot!
<P></P>
At high levels, the ability to cast <I>speak with plants</I> or <I>stone tell</I> proves very useful. If the druid is looking for general information, good
recipients for such a spell include trees or standing stones at crossroads, at
wells, or near town or castle gates.
<P></P>
<B>Animal Aides.</B> Still, druids can be in only one place at a time. In addition to their own
powers, they also use animal resources. <I>Speak with animals</I> gives druids an ability enemies always regret underestimating.
<P></P>
Druids rely on animals mostly in the wild: a spread of furry, feathered, and
scaly &quot;spies&quot; all over the land to keep watch on the movements of friends and
enemies alike. Normally, small, inconspicuous animals work best--especially
birds, with their excellent mobility, aerial vantage point, and good eyesight.
Rodents, from squirrels to mice, rarely get noticed. Domestic animals constitute
another good choice due to their intelligence. They have the added bonus of being
able to tell the druid about the activities inside a building.
<P></P>
To this end, a druid who can speak with animals should use every opportunity
to insinuate these aides into important areas, such as the lord's
stronghold--perhaps a character can even covertly cast <I>animal friendship</I> (or better, <I>charm person</I> or <I>mammal</I>) on a foe's animals. Some individuals may protect their servants from <I>charm</I>, but few think to check domestic animals.
<P></P>
One problem with using animals kept inside a building involves the difficulty
of staying in touch with them. Animal helpers should have an opportunity to
slip out to meet the druid (like a cat that is put out at night) or should remain
in magical contact with the druid. (See the <A HREF="DD05087.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD05087.htm">animal spy</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> spell in Chapter 5: Druidic Magic.) With this logistical problem solved,
domestic animal spies can prove exceedingly effective. People may search high and
low to discover a traitor, never dreaming that traitor is actually a falcon, pet
dog, or war horse!
<P></P>
Animals have a limitation, though: They often don't understand what they see
and hear and sometimes can't determine what is worth reporting. A dog can
recognize certain people and usually has a general idea what its owners are doing,
but it cannot understand speech. A mouse or bat probably cannot tell one person
from another. Animals can tell druids of unusual events, like the passage of a
large body of men. They can warn druids when people have entered or left
buildings or mention when a new monster appears. But, for detailed and reliable
intelligence, the druid needs just that: intelligent spies. To this end, all druids
should make use of the eyes and ears of other inhabitants of the wilderness.
<P></P>
<B>Human and Demihuman Assets.</B> Druids who have lived in an area for a long time should cultivate friendly
contacts among the surrounding manors and villages. If the people openly follow
druidism, they generally inform the druid of unusual happenings as a matter of
course. Otherwise, druids try to place one &quot;agent&quot; in each village or castle in
their area; low-ranking servants often have reason to go into the wilds every
now and then (chopping firewood, grazing the animals, etc.), giving them an
excuse to secretly meet the druid. Some druids befriend children for this purpose,
since no one will miss them when they go out to play, nor will most people
suspect children of passing information.
<P></P>
Druids try to keep in touch with a friend at every roadside and village inn
within their territory. This source isn't necessarily the innkeeper: Someone less
obvious, like a servant or stablekeeper, works better. Since adventurers and
other interesting travelers usually stop at inns, the source can update druids
on newcomers.
<P></P>
The druid must contact these aides regularly to advise them of the sort of
information they should look for and receive their news. Just as important as
having agents is having a means of collecting updates from them, after all. The
2nd-level <I>messenger</I> spell suits this purpose ideally. Innkeepers and the like tend to stay
terribly busy, so providing them with a trained messenger animal (often a bird) can
ensure periodic reports. If the agent (or druid) cannot read or write, the pair
can arrange a simple code: a red ribbon on the bird's foot means, &quot;Come
immediately,&quot; a blue ribbon means, &quot;Interesting strangers staying at the inn.&quot;
<P></P>
A druid's agents almost never work professionally as spies, and few know much
about the druid's doings (helpful, if an enemy questions them). Most are just
ordinary (0-level) men and women. Druids don't have to reveal their identity to
these contacts--they just use their natural charm (Charisma of 15 or better) to
appear as romantic, mysterious figures who will pay well if kept informed of
local gossip. Just as often, druids recruit from among those who are in their
debt. For instance, a druid who used magic to save a child from disease might
recruit the grateful mother as another set of eyes. Also, druids utilize members
of families that have followed the druidic faith for generations (often in
secret). Finally, druids do not hesitate to use <I>charm person</I> or <I>mammal</I> to create excellent involuntary spies when necessary!
<P></P>
Besides these local folk, druids should also strive to be on good terms with
travelers like tinkers, Gypsies, bards, merchants, entertainers, and rangers.
These people, often the first to bear news from the next county, always know what
the neighbors are talking about. Being on &quot;good terms&quot; usually requires making
friends with a few prominent members of these groups and offering magical
assistance at times.
<P></P>
<B>Sylvan Creatures.</B> Elves, satyrs, dryads, treants, sylphs, and similar native creatures
represent a priceless resource every druid should cultivate to the utmost. Their
special powers and ability to blend into the wilderness make them excellent scouts.
In addition, their goals usually parallel those of the druid--the protection of
the woodlands and wilderness--so their information likely will prove timely and
reliable. A character tends to receive a more regular flow of gossip by
befriending <I>particular</I> sylvan beings--make friends with Shaylara the Pixie rather than just staying
on good terms with a &quot;band of pixies.&quot; To foster this comradeship, the druid
should often visit the dwellings of local pixies, sprites, elves, and the like,
and always stand ready to offer help, such as magical <I>cures </I>or protection from adventurers or monsters.
<P></P>
<B>Humanoids and Evil Monsters. </B>Druid characters should not forget that their neutral alignment enables them
to make use of all sorts of information sources. Those who live near a monster
and stay on speaking terms with it sometimes receive a messenger with
information from the creature--which undoubtedly hopes for a favor or bribe. This
relationship generally requires that the druid first win the monster's trust: by
providing food in a harsh winter, using magic to heal injuries, etc.
<P></P>
However, druids must use the stick along with the carrot--most evil creatures
prove truly helpful only after the character demonstrates the fury of druidic
wrath! Even so, humanoids and monsters usually feel happy to alert the druid if
something mysterious is making them uneasy--or if <I>good</I> forces are infiltrating the wilderness.
<P></P>
Remember, evil creatures are notorious liars: They will tell the druid only
what suits them. A tribe of forest-dwelling goblins attacked and routed by two
high-level rangers and a paladin might warn the druid of these intruders--after
changing some details of their encounter with &quot;. . . dozens of human warriors!
We got many, but they were too much powerful. We see them chop down tree . . .&quot; <I>Caveat emptor</I>.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Druidic Ceremonies
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Besides protecting the wilderness and maintaining the cosmic balance, druidic
responsibilities include worshiping Nature through the appropriate ceremonies.
This duty also involves casting spells and presiding over rites, many of which
involve the use of the druids' secret language. (See Chapter 1.) Other
ceremonies benefit the druid's flock--those rural folk who worship Nature (or a Nature
deity) and follow the druidic ethos. The exact rituals vary from circle to
circle and branch to branch, but all druids practice the common ones, including:
<P></P>
<B>Prayers</B>. Druids almost always pray in the form of poems or songs celebrating the
beauty and power of Nature and the druid's role in it. These poems are valued as
much for the beauty of their language and imagery as for their ritual value;
dual-class bard/druids created some of the most memorable ones. A druid should
create new prayers after personal inspiration. Many prayers celebrate a specific
aspect of Nature, such as the beginning of spring, and are sung, chanted, or
spoken only certain days.
<P></P>
<B>Wild Dancing.</B> The ceremonies of druids--especially younger initiates--often involve
dancing. The movements, rarely formal or ritualized, are wild, impulsive, individual,
and ecstatic--a spontaneous celebration of Nature's energy. Druids may dance
while praying to regain spells; although in motion, the druid remains in deep
communion with the powers of Nature during the dance, as oblivious to the rest of
the world as if deep in study.
<P></P>
<B>Holy Days.</B> Like other priests, druids offer brief prayers one or more times a day, but
they also have holidays in which they devote the entire day (or night) to sacred
ceremonies. Druids typically spend two full days every month observing the
holy days of their particular branch and of the Order as a whole. Minor
celebrations usually take place in accordance with the lunar calendar; on the highly
important first days of the full moon and new moon, most druids hold daylong or
nightlong rites, either on their own or in the company of other druids.
<P></P>
Even more important are those ceremonies held four times a year to celebrate
the changing of the seasons. At such times, an archdruid or the great druid
summons most druids in the circle together for a great moot. Initiations and
challenges often, but not always, occur at these times.
<P></P>
<B>Festivals.</B> Festivals are holy days celebrated not just by druids but by the entire
community. If a village or tribe openly follows the druidic philosophy, some or all
the seasonal rites include a joyous public festival. Druids praise Nature and
bless the village, livestock, and crops. Then, with the locals, they sing,
dance, and make merry for the rest of the day around a tree or Maypole in the
village green.
<P></P>
Following the day of celebration, the assemblage builds bonfires on the hills
to ward off evil, enjoys performances by visiting bards, and watches locals
dressed as animals dance to ensure good hunting. Springtime rites, the most
important, end with the casting of <I>plant growth</I> on the fields to guarantee their fertility come harvest time.
<P></P>
Private rites involving only the druids usually follow a festival--often late
at night.
<P></P>
<B>Appeasement.</B> Druids, while they do not always object to replacing wilderness with
cropland, insist on performing a ceremony before any land is cleared. These rites,
designed to appease, comfort, and lay to rest the spirits of the trees and plants
about to be cut down, normally require a druid's presence for half a day per
acre of wilderness slated for clearing. In some cases, a druid high enough in
level casts a <I>commune with nature</I> spell to determine if permitting the destruction is the right thing to do.
<P></P>
A druid unable to perform the rites before the clearing of the land begins
will become very upset. At the DM's discretion, this lack of appeasement also may
lead to the appearance of creatures such as treants, who seek to avenge the
destruction.
<P></P>
<B>Rites of Passage.</B> A young person coming of age usually undergoes a rite of passage into
adulthood. A druid living among the local folk administers this usually secret rite,
which may involve anything from a spiritual revelation to a painful ordeal,
depending on the culture.
<P></P>
For example, the druid, after invoking a blessing, might lead the candidate
into the deep woods, then leave the adolescent to find the way home. Along the
way, the druid may appear in shapechanged forms to act as a guide. Candidates who
make it out of the woods (very likely, unless they ignore or mistreat their
animal guides) are considered adults from that day forward. If they guess that
the druid had been watching over them in animal form, they may find their destiny
lies in a druidic career.
<P></P>
<B>Marriages.</B> Druids perform marriage ceremonies for locals under their spiritual care,
usually simple affairs in a druid's grove or village green. There, the man and
woman share vows to love, respect, and protect one another, with the druid serving
as witness. Following the vows comes an exchange of tokens, prayers for the
couple's health and fertility, and finally a party and feast.
<P></P>
Druids themselves, rarely celibate, usually choose to marry and raise
children. Some circles prefer their druids to limit their choice to &quot;suitable&quot; mates:
druids or bards, and perhaps elves, dryads, or sylphs. Independent rural folk
like tinkers, rangers, Gypsies, or foresters also constitute good choices. Love
can be blind, but a druid generally prefers a mate of neutral alignment, from a
rural background, who follows the druidic faith.
<P></P>
<B>Funerals. </B>Most druids bury their dead (although some prefer cremation), returning the
body of a loved one to the earth near a sacred grove. Mourners celebrate the
deceased through poems and prayers, and a hired bard may offer additional memorials
in song. Finally, the presiding druid blesses the departed spirit and--since
most druids believe in reincarnation--prays for its safe rebirth. Friends and
family then hold a wake to remember the departed person through song, dance, and
merrymaking.
<P></P>
<B>Initiations.</B> Worthy aspirants seeking to enter the druidic order must be initiated by an
inner circle member. The initiation takes place at a moot or in a sacred grove
on a holy day. The candidate, after being purified with holy water, takes the
druidic oath: a promise to preserve the balance of the world, to follow the
druidic ethos, to respect the freedom of other druids in and beyond the circle, to
act as a guardian of Nature (or the deity that personifies Nature to the Order),
and to live true to the druidic order and keep its secrets safe.
