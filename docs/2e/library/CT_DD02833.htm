<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Monster
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Monsters come in all shapes and sizes. The basic monster critical hit charts
assume four limbs, a head, and a tail; however, it is often necessary to use two
different charts to assign a hit location.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Amorphous
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The creature has a fluid body with no obvious limbs; the creature often can
alter its shape freely and can form limbs or appendages as needed. Slimes, oozes,
jellies, and gelatinous cubes are examples of amorphous type creatures.
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits: </B>Amorphous creatures are immune to critical hits.
<P></P>
<B>Combat: </B>Amorphous creatures threaten everything adjacent to them. Fortunately, most of
them are nonintelligent and cannot tactically exploit this ability. Amorphous
creatures have no flank or rear spaces.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Plant/Fungi</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The creature has a fibrous body with no internal skeleton and few or no
internal organs. The creature often has vines or branches instead of arms and roots
or tendrils instead of legs. Myconids, treants, and shambling mounds are
examples of plant/fungi type monsters.
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits:</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B> </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Use the humanoid critical chart. Abdomen and torso hits affect the trunk or
stem. If the creature has no head, head hits affect the trunk instead. Arm hits
affect the creature's branches or grasping appendages. Leg hits affect roots (if
the roots are exposed) or the trunk. The creature ignores crush results, and
all bleeding is automatically reduced by one step.
<P></P>
<B>Combat:</B> Plant/fungi creatures can be very difficult to detect when lurking in normal
foliage. When resolving overbearing attempts, the creature gets the bonus for
having more than four legs (it's pretty difficult to push a treant down). A
plant creature with grasping vines (such as a choke creeper) can make wrestling
attacks without provoking an attack of opportunity; such attacks are resolved
against the creature's normal Armor Class, not AC 10. A creature caught in a
grasping tendril is considered grappled and locked and can use the normal wrestling
procedures to get free.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Dragon
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The creature has a scaly body, a head, two or four legs, and a pair of wings
sprouting from its back. Dragons, pseudo dragons, wyverns, and ki-rin are
examples of dragon type creatures.
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits: </B>If the dragon is the same size or smaller than the attacker, use the monster
charts. If the dragon has only two legs, foreleg hits strike the wings. If the
dragon has four legs, foreleg hits from frontal attacks strike the wings on a
roll or 5 or 6 on 1d6. Reverse the odds for rear attacks (wings are struck on a
roll 1?4). Foreleg hits from flank attacks have equal chances of hitting an arm
or a wing.
<P></P>
If the dragon is one or two sizes larger than the attacker, facing determines
the chart to use. Frontal attacks use the humanoid charts, treating foreleg
hits as wing hits; leg hits strike the forelegs. Flank attacks use the monster
chart, treating foreleg hits as wing hits. Rear attacks use the humanoid chart,
treating foreleg hits as wing hits and head hits as tail hits. If the dragon is
three or more size classes larger than the attacker, it is immune to special
effects from critical hits, though it still suffers double or triple damage.
<P></P>
<B>Combat: </B>Dragons? tactics emphasize mobility. They tend to soften up the opposition
with their breath weapons and special attacks before closing to conduct melee.
Very large dragons like to overrun spellcasters and other physically weak
characters before engaging more formidable characters in physical combat.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Radial
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The creature's body is essentially circular, with a central head and torso
surrounded by limbs. Octopi, xorns, grell, and beholders are examples of radial
type creatures.
<P></P>
Critical Hits: Use the monster charts, treating head hits as torso hits. Any
foreleg hit strikes one of the limbs the creature is currently employing in
combat. Any tail or hind leg hit strikes a limb not involved in combat. If the
creature is employing all its limbs in combat, any leg or tail hit is treated as a
foreleg hit. If the creature's limbs have no joints (an octopus's tentacle, for
example), the creature ignores movement penalties from knee and hip hits.
<P></P>
<B>Combat: </B>A radial creature with sensory organs on its flank or rear negate the usual
bonuses for flank or rear attacks. If the creature also has limbs in its flank or
rear sides it threatens those squares, as well. For example, a zorn threatens
every square adjacent to it with its three arms and three eyes. An intelligent
radial creature might try to grab its opponent's weapons with one or two of its
limbs while attacking normally with the rest. Such grab attempts do not
provoke attacks of opportunity as long as the creature is making more normal attacks
than grab attacks.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Insect/Arachnid
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The creature has a chitinous body divided into two or more segments and
multiple limbs. Giant insects, giant spiders, giant scorpions, and giant crayfish are
examples of insect/arachnid type creatures.
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits: </B>Use the monster charts. If the creature has no tail, treat tail hits as
abdomen hits. Foreleg hits affect the creature's claws or fighting limbs. Hind leg
hits affect one of the creature's other limbs. The effected limb is the one
closest to the attacker; if several limbs are equidistant, roll randomly to see
which limb is effected. The creature's movement is unaffected by damage to the legs
as long as it has at least two undamaged legs on each side of its body. For
example, a giant spider can suffer knee hits to two of its left legs and suffer
no movement penalties. If it suffers damage to a third leg on the left side,
however, its movement is affected. All bleeding results are automatically reduced
by one step.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Worm</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The creature is similar to a snake. It has a long, sinuous body and may or may
not have limbs. Giant slugs, giant centipedes, and purple worms are examples
of worm type creatures.
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits: </B>Use the monster charts. Ignore the effects of leg hits unless the creature has
hands or claws it can use in combat; in such cases, a forelimb hit (a roll of
1 or 2) strikes the fighting limb. All other leg hits are treated as tail hits.
<P></P>
<B>Combat: </B>Very large worm type creatures often can swallow victims whole. If the
creature scores a critical hit, the victim takes double damage and is swallowed whole
instead of suffering a special effect.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Centaur
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The creature has an animal (usually quadruped) body and a humanoid forepart
with a head, torso, abdomen and arms. Centaurs, wemics, and driders are examples
of centaur type creatures.
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits: </B>Use the humanoid charts for frontal attacks. Leg hits affect the creature-s
animal forelegs and arm hits affect the creature's humanoid arms. Use the monster
chart for flank and rear attacks. If the creature has no tail, treat tail hits
as abdomen hits.
<P></P>
<B>Combat: </B>Centaur type creatures armed with missiles function as unmounted archers. Some
centaurs types might use a weapon to parry, block, or disarm while attacking
with their forelimbs.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Merman
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The creature has a fish or snake body and humanoid or animal foreparts.
Mermen, sea lions, and yuan-ti are examples of merman type creatures.
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits: </B>Use the humanoid or animal chart for frontal attacks, re-rolling leg hits. Use
the monster chart for flank and rear attacks. Foreleg hits strike the
creature's arms or forelimbs. Rolls of 3?5 strike the tail. The animal relies on its
tail for movement and suffers movement penalties from tail criticals with
severities of 9 or more.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Lizard Man/Lycanthrope
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The creature has a generally humanoid body shape but also has a tail. Lizard
men and lycanthropes in hybrid form are examples of lizard man/lycanthrope type
creatures.
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits: </B>Use the humanoid chart for frontal attacks. Use the monster chart for flank
and rear attacks. Forelimb hits strike the creature's arms.
<P></P>
<B>Combat: </B>These creatures generally function as humanoids in combat. Many of them also
can bite while attacking with a weapon; bite attacks are made on the creature-s
base initiative phase and can be made simultaneously with a weapon attack.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Other
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The creature defies easy classification. This type includes all creatures that
lack large limbs and well-defined body areas, and creatures that are too small
to present well-defined target areas. Normal insects, crawling claws, and
urchins fall into this category.
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits: </B>Use the monster chart. Treat all critical hits as abdomen hits.
<P></P>
<B>Combat: </B>These creatures usually employ specialized attack forms based on their unique
physical characteristics. Creatures with ranged attacks usually use them in
favor of melee attacks.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Undead</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The creature is dead; it can be an animated or transformed corpse, such as a
skeleton, ghoul or vampire, or a physical manifestation of a dead creature-s
spirit, such as a ghost, wraith, or spectre.
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits: </B>Use the chart appropriate for the creature's body type; most undead are
humanoid. Undead are immune to most critical hits. They completely ignore grazed,
struck, and injured results. They suffer only the movement penalties for crushed,
shattered, and destroyed results (they ignore attack penalties and hit point
reductions). Undead ignore bleeding effects. Incorporeal undead ignore critical
hits altogether, but still suffer double damage.
<P></P>
<B>Combat: </B>Most undead eagerly enter melee combat. Mindless undead simply attack.
Intelligent undead hope to make full use of their touch-delivered special attacks.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Golem
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The creature is an artificial construct or magically animated object. The
various golems and most animated objects are examples of golem type creatures.
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits: </B>Use the chart appropriate for the creature's body type; most golems are
humanoid. Golems are hard to hurt; reduce all severity rolls by two (treat results of
0 or less as no effect). They completely ignore grazed, struck, and injured
results. They are immune to bleeding. They suffer only the movement penalties for
crushed, shattered, and destroyed results (they ignore attack penalties and
hit point reductions).
<P></P>
<B>Combat: </B>Most golems are mindless. If left on their own, they move directly into melee,
attacking whatever creatures they can reach. Golems under another creature-s
direction might employ more sophisticated tactics, depending on the directing
creature's ability to formulate plans and communicate them effectively.
