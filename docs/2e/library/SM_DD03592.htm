Critical Strikes </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Sometimes, a spell or a special attack strikes with such devastating effect
that even the toughest opponent can be crippled or killed by a single blow.
Critical strikes reflect this capability; even a lowly <I>magic missile </I>might strike the cyclops in his eye, while a <I>lightning bolt </I>that strikes a warrior dead-on can kill him in an instant.
<P></P>
Critical strikes add flavor and pseudo-realism to the AD&amp;D game by increasing
the likelihood that the use of a spell will decide a fight one way or the
other. An AD&amp;D combat can be reduced to a simple process of attrition, but the use
of magic should create the potential for a battle-ending injury. Even if the
evil giant has 90 hit points, and the wizard?s <I>fireball </I>won?t do more than 42 points of damage at its very best, a critical strike may
allow that spell to severely wound or incapacitate the giant. After all, it?s
not very heroic to throw six volleys of <I>magic missiles </I>into the same evil high priest; it denigrates the value of magic.
<P></P>
Critical strikes can also represent special attack forms common among
monsters. Creatures that spit acid, breathe fire, or exhale poison gas are just as
likely to kill a hero as a creature that rends him limb from limb with fang and
claw. A hell hound may only inflict 4 to 7 points of damage with its fiery breath,
but that doesn?t mean that a 60-hit point fighter should not be threatened by
the monster?s attack! Critical strikes help to keep characters honest since <I>any </I>attack could result in severe injury or death.
