These may be considered as necessary for discovering small traps which are
affixed to locks. Without them, the thief cannot use his find traps skill nor his
remove traps skill for dealing with such traps. Improvised lockpicks have a -30
penalty to both skill rolls. The kind of traps involved here are small
poisoned needles inside drawers or coffers; spring-triggered poison dart traps inside
containers; and so on.
