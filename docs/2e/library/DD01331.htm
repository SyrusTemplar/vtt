</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Create: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The spell creates something out of nothing. The caster can create a wall or
block of material.
<P></P>
At base difficulty (25), the caster creates a wall of energy (fire, lightning,
or cold) five feet square and hair thin. Anything passing through the wall
suffers 2d8 points of damage plus one point per caster level. Anything within 10
feet of the sheet suffers 1d8 points of damage, save vs. spells for half.
<P></P>
The caster can orient a wall of energy in any direction and shape it in any
fashion. Once created, the wall remains in place and retains its shape for the
duration of the spell. The wall can be cast upon a creature without difficulty,
but the target suffers the lesser amount of damage unless the sheet is combined
with a strike spell?in which case a save vs. spells for half damage applies. At
the caster?s option, one side of the wall can be harmless, inflicting no
damage even to things that pass through it.
<P></P>
If the caster increases the difficulty to get a wall larger than the minimum
size, use the area column from <A HREF="DD01333.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01333.htm">Table 29</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. The wall is five feet high and as long as the area?s base dimension. For
example, adding five points to the difficulty makes a wall five feet high and 50
feet long. The caster can increase the height by reducing the length. For
example, a 50-foot wall becomes 10 feet high and 25 feet long.
<P></P>
Doubling the base difficulty (50) creates a wall of soft material (such as
wood, clay, or ice) five feet square and six inches thick. The caster can double
the thickness by halving the area.
<P></P>
The caster can orient a physical wall in any direction and shape it freely.
Once created, the wall retains its shape for the duration of the spell. If not
properly supported, either by previously existing material or by virtue of a
self-supporting shape (see the <I>wall of stone</I> spell description in the <A HREF="PHB_DD02013.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD02013.htm">PHB</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>for guidelines), the wall falls over, inflicting 3d10 points of damage on any
creature caught underneath (save vs. death magic to avoid). If the wall is
created in the same space as a target, it appears with a hole large enough to allow
the target to remain unharmed.
<P></P>
At triple the base difficulty (75), the caster can create a wall of a hard
substance, such as granite or iron. The wall has the same general characteristics
as a wall of soft material, but if it falls, it crushes and kills creatures
caught underneath (save vs. death magic to avoid).
<P></P>
At quadruple the base difficulty (100), the caster creates a wall of pure
force that duplicates the effects of the 5th-level wizard spell <I>wall of force</I>.
<P></P>
At base difficulty (35), the caster can create a 50-pound block of simple
elemental matter, such as water or dirt, or a pile of smaller blocks whose total
weight does not exceed 50 pounds. At double difficulty (70) the caster can create
soft, compound materials, such as brick or wood. At triple difficulty (105),
the caster can create common, pure metals, such as iron or lead. The caster can
combine a creation spell with an imbue spell to create valuable metals as
detailed in the transform spell.
<P></P>
A creation spell that produces matter?not force or energy?can be made
permanent without the loss of a point of Constitution.

</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Strike: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The spell directs energy or force against a target.
<P></P>
At base difficulty (25), the caster inflicts 2d8 points of damage plus one
point per caster level by touch. The damage can be delivered through a burst of
energy (fire, electricity, or cold) or force. The target is allowed a saving
throw vs. spell for half damage. Energy bursts can damage objects, but force bursts
cannot. A touch-delivered strike requires an attack roll, but a ranged strike
does not. For every five points of additional difficulty, the caster can add
1d8, to a maximum of 30d8.
<P></P>
Adding a duration to a strike creates a static effect that can damage anything
that blunders into it while the spell lasts.
<P></P>
If a strike is combined with a wall of energy, the resulting spell inflicts
wall damage or strike damage, whichever is greater. The combination spell effect
can be imbued with an animate spell to create an effect that moves at the
caster?s command. The mobile spell has an Armor Class of 0 and as many hit points as
the caster. The spell effect can be harmed only by magical weapons and magical
attacks; an effect is immune to its own form of energy.
<P></P>
A strike combined with a force wall can trap a target for the duration of the
spell provided it is large enough to surround the creature. The target is not
otherwise harmed and may escape by destroying the wall or teleporting away. The
combined spell can be imbued with an animate spell and move at the caster?s
command, grasping, crushing, or smashing objects. The effect is similar to the
9th-level spell <I>Bigby?s crushing hand </I>spell except that it has an Armor Class of ?2 and twice the caster?s hit
points.
