Low Powers are those which are of some usefulness in situations which arise
occasionally in the campaign, or are of great usefulness in situations which
hardly ever arise. Here are some examples of Low Powers:
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Analysis, Detection, Identification</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
With this power, the priest can identify a category of persons, places, or
things. He must be within 10' of the object in order to identify it correctly; he
does not have to see it, and the object can be hidden. In some cases, it could
even be buried.
<P></P>
If the DM designs it as part of the ability, the priest can also <I>analyze</I> the object and get additional details about it. The type of information
brought about by this analysis varies from object to object, as we'll discuss below.
<P></P>
Here are some examples:
<P></P>
A priest of the god of <B>healing</B> could identify and analyze injury and illness. He could look at an injury and
see not just where it hurts, but also if it is infected or poisoned, how long
ago it was inflicted, etc. He could look at a sick person and determine which
disease afflicts him, what stage of advancement the disease is in, and what the
sick person's chances of recovery are.
<P></P>
A priest of the god of <B>good</B> could <I>detect evil</I> , as per the first-level Priest spell; analysis would let him know whether
the evil were lawful, neutral, or chaotic in orientation.
<P></P>
A priest of the god of <B>goldsmithing</B> could <I>detect gold</I> , including refined gold that has been hidden or unmined gold still under the
earth.
<P></P>
Some of these powers of identification and analysis are especially useful,
such as those which duplicate <I>detect good, detect evil</I> , and <I>detect magic</I> spells. These may only be used three times per day. Other powers may be used
any number of times per day. These powers are not automatic; the priest must
concentrate for a full round in order to use this power.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Immunities</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
As a Low Power, Immunity can act in one of two ways.
<P></P>
A granted Immunity can give the priest an automatically-successful saving
throw against one specific type of poison or magic spell. For example, a priest
could automatically save against cobra venom, or against the <I>fireball</I> spell.
<P></P>
Alternatively, such an Immunity could give the priest a +2 bonus to Saving
Throws against a narrow category of spells; a narrow category of special powers;
or a narrow category of poisons. These are the same categories the Medium Power
immunities are broken down into; the difference here is that the Low Power
immunity only grants a +2 bonus to saves vs. those attacks, instead of providing an
automatically successful saving throw.
<P></P>
Therefore, a Low Power immunity could give a priest automatic success against
the <I>charm</I> spell; a different one could give the priest automatic success against the
paralysis brought on by the ghoul's touch; a different one could provide a +2
bonus to all saving throws vs. all enchantment spells; another one would provide a
+2 bonus to all saving throws vs. any sort of paralysis ability or spell.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Language and Communication</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
As a Low Power, the priest receives one extra language appropriate to the
priesthood. If the campaign uses the nonweapon proficiency rules, this power
consists of an extra nonweapon proficiency slot which must be used to take one
specific extra language.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Soothing Word</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
With this power, the priest can remove the effects of the <I>fear </I>spell or can sway the attitude of a hostile crowd or mob.
<P></P>
The priest can use this power three times per day. A single use can either:
Dispel one application of the<I> fear</I> spell on one victim; eliminate one warrior's berserker rage; or momentarily
calm down a number of characters or monsters (equal to 2x the priest's
experience level in hit dice; therefore an 8th level priest could momentarily calm 16 HD
of angry mob, for instance).
<P></P>
This power is primarily useful for getting the attention of an angry group of
people and allowing the priest to address them. The combination of the <I>soothing word</I> , the respect that many cultures have for their priests, and the speaking
abilities of many priests can often defuse an angry mob.
<P></P>
As described above, this power is most appropriate to priests of the gods of
healing, love, music, peace, and wisdom.
<P></P>
If the DM limits this power still further, it becomes appropriate to other
classes of priest. For instance, if the <I>soothing word</I> only works on animals, it becomes appropriate for priests of the gods of
animal protection, the earth, fertility, and hunting. If it only works on dwarves,
it is appropriate for priests of the god of the dwarven race.
