<FONT SIZE="4"><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>The Kits</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>Academician</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Description:</B> The Academician is a learned
scholar whose love of knowledge is matched only by his preoccupation
with research. He is fascinated by magic in all its forms and enjoys
nothing more than poring over arcane texts and experimenting with
exotic magical devices.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The Academician spends so much time involved in
intellectual pursuits that he tends to neglect his physical skills.
He is not a particularly good fighter and avoids combat when he can,
preferring negotiation and parley to violence. Still, he recognizes
the necessity of combat in certain instances, and will fight
valiantly when required.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Academicians can be found in virtually any culture,
but they are most likely to come from large urban areas that provide
ready access to libraries, museums, laboratories, and other resources.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">A character must have a minimum Intelligence of 13 and
a minimum Wisdom of 11 to become an Academician.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">There are no special rules for abandoning this kit. An
Academician who becomes disillusioned with the academic life or loses
interest in intellectual pursuits can choose to neglect his studies
or research, but he is free to resume them at any time.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Preferred Schools:</B> The Academician is intrigued
by all the schools of magic, but is especially drawn to schools with
a wide range of spells, including alteration, illusion, and invocation/evocation.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Barred Schools:</B> There are no barred schools for
the Academician.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Role:</B> In his homeland, the Academician is a
respected member of society, valued for his skills as a teacher and
advisor as well as for his seemingly endless store of knowledge on a
variety of subjects. Most likely, he will fill similar roles in a campaign.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">In spite of his somewhat sedentary background, the
Academician welcomes the chance to join an adventuring party. For
him, it is an unparalleled opportunity to experience new cultures,
acquire new devices, and acquire first-hand information about people,
places, and creatures he may have only read about.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Secondary Skills:</B> Required: Scribe.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Required (the player may
choose from the following): Dagger, Dart, Knife, or Sling.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Bonus Proficiency:
Reading/Writing. Recommended: (General) Artistic Ability, Etiquette,
Heraldry, Languages (Modern); (Wizard) Ancient History, Astrology,
Herbalism, Languages (Ancient), Spellcraft; (Priest) Local History.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Special Benefits:</B> The Academician receives both
of the following benefits:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">1. Academicians maintain an extensive correspondence
with scholars throughout the world. Additionally, an Academician's
reputation as a man of wisdom often precedes him. When encountering
an NPC who is familiar with his reputation, who turns out to be one
of his correspondents, who fancies himself an intellectual, or who is
an author, researcher, teacher, journalist, or fellow scholar, the
Academician receives a +3 reaction bonus.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">2. The Academician receives a bonus to all
Intelligence Checks and Wisdom Checks. The DM has two options for
assigning this bonus. He may simply give the Academician a flat +1 to
his Intelligence and Wisdom Checks, or he can consult Table 5, which
takes the Academician's age and race into account; as the Academician
ages, his bonuses increase. Once a method for assigning these bonuses
is chosen, it cannot be changed later.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Special Hindrances:</B> Academicians lack the
training and instinct to make good hand-to-hand fighters. When
attacking with any type of melee weapon, the Academician always has a
-1 penalty to hit on his first blow. Subsequent blows-- when the
Academician has had an opportunity to size up his opponent and adjust
his attacks accordingly-- are made without this penalty. However, if
the Academician attacks a different opponent, his first blow against
his new victim is also made at -1.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Academicians tend to be know-it-alls, and
unhesitatingly offer their opinions even on matters they know little
about. Whenever the party needs to make a decision, the Academician
should offer his opinion; for effective role-playing, the player
should have his player speak his mind with unshakable confidence. If
other player characters disagree, the Academician might lecture them
on the error of their ways, welcome the opportunity for a spirited
argument, or roll his eyes at his companion's blatant display of ignorance.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Wealth Options:</B> The Academician receives the
normal (1d4 +1) x 10 gp as starting money.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Races:</B> No restrictions</FONT></P>
