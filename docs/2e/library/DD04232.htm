This spell gives the wild mage the ability to seize magical energy directed at
him and reshape it as he desires. While it is in effect, the spell gives no
visible sign of its existence. It offers no protection against area effect spells.
<P></P>
If a wild mage is the target of a spell or magical item, this spell
automatically allows him a saving throw. If the saving throw is failed, the opponent's
spell has normal effects. If the saving throw is successful, the <I>spell shape</I> absorbs the magical energy of the opponent's spell. The wild mage can then
choose to let the energy dissipate or he can instantly use it to cast a spell
back at the opposing mage. The return spell must be of an equal or lesser spell
level than the original one and must be currently memorized by the mage. The act
of returning the spell does not cost the wild mage any of his memorized spells.
Spell energy cannot be saved; if not used immediately, it dissipates.
<P></P>
For example, Hamos, a wild mage, is protected by a <I>spell shape</I> and is struck by a <I>finger of death</I> (a 7th-level spell). He succeeds at his saving throw and is now able to cast
a spell of 7th level or lower. Hamos currently has <I>feeblemind</I> memorized. Since it is only a 5th-level spell, he chooses to cast it back at
his enemy. He makes his level variation check (and doesn't get a wild surge)
and the <I>feeblemind</I> is sent hurtling back at his foe. Hamos still has his original <I>feeblemind</I> memorized. The remaining two spell levels are lost, since they were not used
in the same round.
<P></P>
If a wild mage is struck by two spells at once, he may choose which spell to
shape. He suffers all effects of the remaining spell.
<P></P>
The material component is a diamond worth no less than 2,000 gp. When the
spell is cast, the diamond is transformed into a lump of coal.
