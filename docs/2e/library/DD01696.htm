</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Magical weapons are easier to wield in combat than ordinary ones. Maybe the
weapon is lighter or better balanced than normal; maybe it just pulls the
character into the proper position of its own volition. Whatever the cause, each bonus
point conferred by a magical weapon reduces the speed factor of that weapon by
1. (A <I>sword +3</I> reduces the weapon speed factor by 3, for example.) When a weapon has two
bonuses, the lesser one is used. No weapon can have a speed factor of less than 0.
