In this case, there is a central thieves' guild still. However, individual
figures within the guild have taken power unto themselves in important ways. Local
thief leaders may insist on almost complete discretion to do what they want in
their areas, while agreeing not to intrude on other local leaders' territory.
Power struggles within the guild will be commonplace under these circumstances.
