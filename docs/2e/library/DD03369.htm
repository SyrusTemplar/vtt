Integrating <I>Spells &amp; Magic </I>into Your Campaign </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I>Player's Option: Spells &amp; Magic </I>is designed principally as an expansion, not a replacement. However, there are
a few special cases where the information presented here should be taken as an
update and replacement of existing rules. Specifically, the wizard spell
schools and priest spell spheres have been slightly rearranged to improve game
balance and make the wizard and priest specialist classes more competitive with
respect to the general versions of these characters, the mage and the cleric.
<P></P>
Most of the rest of this book can be integrated piecemeal into an existing
campaign without any trouble. For example, additional proficiencies and new spells
can be approved or disapproved by the DM on a case-by-case basis. These were
designed to be completely usable with or without the Player's Option rules.
