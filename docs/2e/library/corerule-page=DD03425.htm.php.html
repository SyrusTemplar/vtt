Known primarily for their love of nature and guardianship of the wilderness,
druids possess remarkable abilities in areas dealing with plants, animals,
weather, and the elements. Druids with a Wisdom and Charisma score of 16 or better
earn a 10% bonus to the experience they gain. Because of their views, druids
must be neutral in alignment.

Except for a slight change in the spheres of access, druids keep all of the
abilities and powers listed in the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01489.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01489.htm.php.html">PHB</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> .
