<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Plate Mail of Etherealness:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This is seemingly normal <I>plate mail +5,</I> but if a command word is spoken, the suit enables its wearer and all
nonliving items he wears and carries to become ethereal, as if <I>oil of etherealness</I> had been used. While in the ethereal state the wearer cannot attack material
creatures. A <I>phase door</I> spell will negate the ethereal state and prevent the armor from functioning
for one day.
<P></P>
There are 20 charges placed upon <I>plate mail of etherealness.</I> Once used, these cannot be replaced or recharged. Furthermore, every five
uses reduces the bonus of the armor by one: If five charges are used to become
ethereal, the armor is +4, if 10 are used it is +3, +2 if 15 are used, and only +1
if all 20 are exhausted.
