Jousting is a type of combat where two mounted warriors, armed with lances
ride at one another and try to spit one another with their weapons.
<P></P>
It's the sport of knights and kings, and is very appropriate to campaigns with
a medieval setting.

<P></P>
As a special rule, when two riders are jousting, don't bother with initiative
rolls. On the first round of a joust, the two jousters ride at one another and
roll attack rolls; on the second, both continue their ride, turn around, and
start back toward one another.
<P></P>
All attacks are resolved simultaneously. Initiative does not enter the picture.
<P></P>
If jousting is taking place during a larger battle, where other things are
going on and initiative must be rolled, try this: When it's time for the jouster
who won initiative to take his action, the jouster who lost initiative also gets
to make his attack roll, though this takes place during the middle of the
enemy's combat sequence. This helps simulate the fact that the lance-strikes take
place simultaneously.

<P></P>
<P></P>
When a character has multiple attacks in a single round, and is jousting, he
does not get multiple lance attacks. He can only use that lance once in a combat
round (and loses the next round turning his horse, if he's to come back and
face the same enemy).
<P></P>
However, that second attack in the same round can still be effective; the best
use for it is for the rider to Parry the incoming lance attack with his
shield. This can make a joust a lengthier affair—which isn't a bad thing; a classic
joust should go on for a few rounds at least.

length the usefulness of the lance in dismounting opponents.
<P></P>
The lance is designed to dismount opponents as well as to inflict damage.
Anytime a lance hits a mounted target and does 8 points or more of damage (after
doubling), the victim has a chance of being dismounted. He must roll his Riding
proficiency; if he fails, he falls for an additional 1–2 damage.
<P></P>
Since both lancers can hit at the same time, and both can conceivably miss
their Riding rolls, both can be dismounted simultaneously . . . which tends to be
embarrassing, and can be dangerous in large battles.

<P></P>
<P></P>
Lances often break. Any lance that hits and does more than 12 points of
damage, and any lance that has been successfully Parried by a shield, may break. The
player rolls 1d6; on a 1 or 2, the lance breaks and is useless (except as a
club).
