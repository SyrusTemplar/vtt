</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Acid</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> is particularly grim. Aside from the possibility of scarring (which is left
to the DM), acid damage cannot be healed by regeneration. It must be healed
normally. Thus, it is very useful against regenerating creatures such as trolls.
Acid is very rare.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Holy Water</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">affects most forms of undead and creatures from the lower planes. It has no
effect against a creature in gaseous form or undead without material form.
<P></P>
Unholy water (essentially holy water used by evil priests) affects paladins,
creatures whose purpose is to defend good (lammasu, shedu, etc.), and creatures
and beings from the upper planes.
<P></P>
Holy (or unholy) water affects creatures as does acid, causing damage that
cannot be regenerated but must be healed normally.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Oil</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> causes damage only when it is lit. This normally requires a two-step
process--first soaking the target in flammable oil and then setting it afire. Thus,
using flaming oil often requires two successful attacks.
<P></P>
A direct hit from flaming oil burns for two rounds, causing 2d6 points of
damage in the first round and 1d6 points in the second.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Poison</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> is generally not very effective as a missile weapon. Most poisons take effect
only if the missile scores a direct hit, and even then only if it drops into
the gaping maw of some huge creature. Contact poisons have normal poison
<P></P>
effects on a direct hit.
