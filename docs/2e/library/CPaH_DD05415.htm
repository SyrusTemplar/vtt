   Paladins may be dual-classed. They have access to any character kit the DM
allows in the campaign. To change from a paladin to another class, the paladin
must have a minimum score of 15 in Strength, Constitution, and Wisdom (he already
has an acceptably high Charisma score). He must have a score of 17 or better in
the prime requisites of the new class.
<P></P>
   Note that a paladin wishing to become dual-classed can't dual-class with any
of the warrior classes, nor with thieves (due to alignment restrictions) or
wizards (wizards can't wear armor). In most cases, the cleric is the only viable
option for a dual-classed paladin.

   A character from another class who wants to convert to a paladin must have a
minimum score of 15 in the prime requisites and a score of 17 or better in
Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, and Charisma. A character of any lawful good class
other than a warrior may convert to a paladin.
