Another way to modify standard monsters is to assign ability scores to them.
This method is more time consuming than applying a simple modifier to make the
monster bigger or stronger, but it allows for greater variety. Generating
ability scores for a monster also makes it possible for the creature to undertake
actions during an encounter that might require an ability check, and it makes
opposed checks between monsters and characters possible. (How likely is that
fighter to win a tug-o-war with a giant toad?)
<P></P>
The system presented here is intended for use with nonhumanoid creatures
(humanoids are best treated as characters, see <I>The Complete Book of Humanoids</I> for extensive examples), but it can be used with any creature in a pinch.
Start by noting the Size and Intelligence ratings from the creature’s description.
These two ratings determine the range of ability scores the creature can have
(see <A HREF="DD01241.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01241.htm">Tables 6</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> –<A HREF="DD01246.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01246.htm">11</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">).
<P></P>
To generate an ability score, roll 3d6 on the appropriate table and read the
result from the applicable column. For example, a rust monster is a man-sized
creature with animal Intelligence. To generate a Strength score for a rust
monster, roll 3d6 on <A HREF="DD01236.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01236.htm">Table 5</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> and read the result from the M column; a roll of 10 yields a Strength score
of 12. To generate the rust monster’s Intelligence score, roll 3d6 on <A HREF="DD01243.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01243.htm">Table 8</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> and read the result from the A column; a roll of 18 yields an Intelligence
score of 4—an Einstein among rust monsters. The creature gains all the bonuses
and penalties associated with its actual ability score as listed in the <A HREF="PHB_DD01424.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01424.htm">Player’s Handbook</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. The notes below contain additional information.
<P></P>
When you have finished generating the creature’s ability scores, it might be
necessary to recalculate its XP value according to the rules in the <A HREF="DMG_DD00374.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00374.htm">Dungeon Master Guide</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, Chapter 8. For example, a creature with high Constitution score probably has
greater than average hit points and should have a higher XP value than its
less robust cousins.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Strength: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Except as noted, all modifiers apply to creatures in the same way they do for
characters. Creatures gain the warrior combat bonuses for high scores.
<P></P>
<I>Damage Adjustment:</I> The bonus or penalty applies to the creature’s natural attacks. If the
creature rolls multiple dice to determine damage, the bonus or penalty applies to the
total, not to each die.
<P></P>
<I>Weight Allowance:</I> Add 35 pounds to a creature’s weight allowance if it is large, 70 pounds if
it is huge, and 105 pounds if it is gargantuan. If published rules list a
carrying capacity for a creature, use either the listed capacity or the modified
weight allowance from the creature’s Strength score, whichever is higher.
<P></P>
<I>Open Doors:</I> Size L and larger creatures can use this ability to batter down or smash
holes in simple wooden walls.
<P></P>
<I>Bend Bars/Lift Gates:</I> A creature that can bring its full bulk to bear on an object gains the
following bonuses by size category: S or M, 0; L, +5%; H, +10%; and G, +20%.
Exceptionally sturdy objects built to handle heavy loads or restrain large creatures
negate the bonus. For example, a griffon would get the bonus when straining
against a normal rope but not when pulling against a rope made to anchor a ship.
