If you decide to allow demihumans unlimited advancement, consider this option:
To counteract the demihumans' long life, slow down their advancement. Require
demihumans to earn two, three, or even four times as many experience points as
a human to advance a level.
<P></P>
This allows the short-lived humans to advance more quickly than their
long-lived comrades, who will eventually catch up after the humans' demise. If this
solution, though logical, is unacceptable to your players, a compromise may be
called for.
<P></P>
The best compromise is to allow demihumans normal (or double-cost) advancement
to their &quot;maximum&quot; levels. Then require them to earn triple or quadruple
experience points to advance beyond that point. They will advance very slowly, but
the players will still have a goal and the sense of accomplishment that comes
with rising a level.
