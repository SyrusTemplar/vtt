<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Juggling:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The character can juggle, a talent useful for entertainments, diversions, and
certain rare emergencies. When juggling normally (to entertain or distract), no
proficiency check is required. A check is made when trying spectacular tricks
(&quot;Watch me eat this apple in mid-air!&quot;). However, juggling also enables the
character to attempt desperate moves. On a successful attack roll vs. AC 0 (not a
proficiency check), the character can catch small items thrown to harm him (as
opposed to items thrown for him to catch). Thus, the character could catch a
dagger or a dart before it hits. If this attack roll fails, however, the
character automatically suffers damage (sticking your hand in the path of a dagger is
likely to hurt).
