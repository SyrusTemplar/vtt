When a wizard learns a new spell, he usually acquires it from a teacher, a
discovered spell book, another wizard, or his own research. But there are many
more ways to learn new spells--some of the more unusual possibilities are listed
below (in all cases, the wizard must successfully learn a new spell once it is
revealed to him)

Most dragons are masters of magic. A friendly dragon might teach a wizard a
new spell as a reward for helping him or as a bribe to leave him alone.
<P></P>
The DM should note that the magic of dragons is significantly different from
the magic normally wielded by wizards, so it is unlikely that a wizard could
learn to cast a spell in the same manner as a dragon; however, a dragon of
exceptional intelligence might know the formula for a spell useable by humans (or know
where to find it) and reveal the information to a wizard

<P></P>
<P></P>
Ancient obelisks, monoliths, and other structures are occasionally inscribed
with the formulas of spells. Locating such a monument can be an adventure in
itself. For instance, a wizard who died thousands of years ago may be entombed in
a pyramid in the heart of an unexplored jungle; prior to his death, the wizard
inscribed the formulas of his spells on the walls of his tomb so he could have
access to them in the afterlife

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The alternate planes of existence are filled with an unending variety of weird
phenomena, strange landmarks, and bizarre entities. A wizard might find a
magic formula spelled out in giant runes stretched across an entire plane of the
Abyss. Or he might stumble across a horde of ape-like creatures in the plane of
Elysium chanting the formula of a spell. The inhabitants of the elemental plane
of Fire might know the secrets of a variety of fire-related spells, while the
occupants of the elemental plane of Earth might be willing to share the formulas
for earth-related spells in exchange for a favor

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>4. Summoned Creatures
<P></P>
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> A creature summoned as a result of <I>invisible stalker</I>, <I>monster summoning</I>, or a similar spell might negotiate for his freedom by offering to teach the
caster a spell or show him where to find a spell formula. If the summoned
creature is exceptionally knowledgeable, it might be able to dictate a formula to
the wizard; it might even be able to cause a spell formula to magically appear in
his spell book (in which case, the wizard has his normal chance to learn it;
if he fails, the spell formula disappears).

<P></P>
<P></P>
Magic-using creatures from other planes of existence sometimes use gems,
crystals, or mirrors as substitutes for spell books to record the formulas of their
spells. Although wizards from the prime material plane are ordinarily unable to
use such items to record their own spells, a DM might allow that a wizard
could stumble across such a gem or mirror; if the wizard studied the item, a cloud
of mist might materialize inside it, containing the symbols of a spell formula
