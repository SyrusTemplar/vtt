Scrolls</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Like potions, scrolls are fairly easy to manufacture and are also accessible
to characters of moderate level. Scrolls come in two varieties: spell scrolls
and protection scrolls. Spell scrolls are exactly what the name implies—scrolls
that store spells that can be cast simply by being read. Protection scrolls are
special single-use magical items that provide defense against a number of
threats.
<P></P>
While any character may read a protection scroll without the benefit of a read
magic spell, wizard spells cannot be cast from a scroll or transcribed into a
spell book until a <I>read magic </I>spell or effect has been employed by the reader. This can be done at the time
of the scroll’s use, or the reader can prepare ahead of time by using <I>read magic </I>in advance; once magically read, a scroll remains intelligible for the
character who reads it. Note that only wizards, thieves, and bards may read wizard
spells from spell scrolls; thieves and bards can bypass the normal requirement to <I>read magic </I>by using their special class abilities.
<P></P>
Priest spells do not require a <I>read magic </I>spell in order to be used from a scroll. Priests, thieves, and bards may read
priest spells from spell scrolls.
<P></P>
Low-level wizards and priests may be able to read spells from scrolls that are
normally beyond their abilities; even a 1st-level wizard has a chance to
pronounce the incantation for a <I>fireball </I>or <I>lightning bolt </I>correctly.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Level Requirements: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Wizards may create scrolls when they reach 9th level. Priests may scribe
scrolls when they reach 7th level. Any spell the character knows (or has access to,
in the case of a priest) can be placed on a scroll, or the character may
attempt to create a protection scroll.
<P></P>
Geometers (specialists in the wizard school of geometry) have a special
ability to create spell scrolls beginning at 4th level and protection scrolls at 7th
level. When a geometer reaches 9th level, he may instead use the normal scroll
creation process if he so desires.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Facilities: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Wizards require access to any kind of laboratory (alchemical, forge, or
research) in order to blend the ink for the scroll, although this is a fairly simple
task given the right ingredients. Priests can blend the ink in any reasonable
work area, but then must have access to a consecrated altar in order to actually
scribe the scroll.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Research: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There is no research required for spell scrolls or for protection scrolls that
mirror spells available to the character. For example, if a wizard knows how
to cast <I>antimagic shell</I>, he can write a scroll of <I>protection from magic </I>without performing any kind of research. If the scroll has no spell equivalent
known to the character, he must research the scroll using the normal spell
research rules. To figure out a scrolls’s effective spell level, divide the
experience point value by 500 and then add 2 (Level = XP/500+2). For example, scrolls
worth 1,000 experience points are considered 4th-level spells;

Protection scrolls that have spell equivalents include the following scrolls:

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Processes and Materials: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Scrolls require three components: some form of paper, a specially-blended ink,
and a unique quill. Common paper, parchment, or papyrus may be used to create
the scroll; paper provides a +5% bonus to the success roll, while papyrus
inflicts a –5% penalty. All scrolls require a rare quill of some kind.
<P></P>
Ink for spells of 1st to 3rd level requires a rare ingredient; ink for spells
of 4th to 6th level requires an exotic ingredient; and ink for spells of 7th to
9th level requires a rare and an exotic ingredient. (Use the spell level
equivalents noted above for protection scrolls.)
<P></P>
Geometers have the special advantage of requiring nothing except common paper
or parchment and a rare quill (which can only be used once); the ink is not
important for the geometer’s scrolls.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cost and Time: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Inscribing a spell onto a scroll takes one day per spell level, while creating
a protection scroll takes one full week of uninterrupted work. The only cost
incurred is that of obtaining the required materials.
<P></P>
Geometers have the same time requirements, but must pay 100 gp per spell level
for their materials for spell scrolls, or 300 to 1,800 gp (3d6x100) for
protection scrolls.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Success or Failure: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The base chance to successfully create a scroll is 80%, +1% per character
level, –1% per spell level (or equivalent spell level, in the case of protection
scrolls). If the character fails the success check, the spell he is currently
inscribing fails, and he may not add any more spells to that scroll, but any
spells previously placed on the scroll remain intact and may still be used.
<P></P>
The DM should make the check in secret, since a natural 96 or higher on the
success check creates a <I>cursed </I>scroll. The creator of the scroll has no idea that his work is flawed until he
tries to use that particular spell.
<P></P>
Geometers use a learn spells check instead of the normal success check if they
produce the scroll without any magical ingredients or processes. If a geometer
creates a scroll using the usual methods described above, he gains a +5% bonus
to his success check due to his familiarity with scrolls.
<P></P>

<I>Milana, an 8th-level priestess, decides to create a </I>scroll of protection from poison<I>, since she and her fellow adventurers intend to go wyvern-hunting. Because
Milana is capable of casting the spell </I>neutralize poison<I>, she does not need to do any research. Because the spell equivalent is 4th
level, the scroll requires an exotic material for the ink. The DM decides that
the ink must include nightshade harvested during the dark of the moon, so Milana
spends a week or more locating the deadly mushrooms and waiting for the proper
time to collect them. The quill must be a feather steeped in the venom of an
adder, and Milana attends to that as well. Fortunately, her temple is near a
good-sized town, and she can easily procure paper.
<P></P>
After gathering the necessary materials, Milana blends the ink (no cost or
time) and begins scribing </I>scroll of protection from poison<I>. This requires one full week, at no particular cost—although the patriarch of
her temple suggests that an offering for the use of the altar would be
appreciated. Milana’s chance of success is 80%, +8% for her level, –4% for the
equivalent level of the scroll. The use of paper gives her a +5% bonus, for a total of
89%. Milana passes the check easily, and finishes her scroll.
