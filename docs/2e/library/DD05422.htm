?? Paladins often embellish their armor, clothing, weapons, and shields to
identify them on the battlefield, indicate rank, or symbolize allegiance to a king or
church. Monarchs sometime present embellishments to recognize outstanding
military service. Embellishments representing the family name may be handed down
from parent to child. As a rule, embellishments can't be purchased; they must be
awarded or earned. Some examples:
<P></P>
<B>?? Badge.</B> This is an emblem representing the paladin's homeland, family, or order (see
Chapter 9). A badge may be a physical object, such as pin or a medal, or it may
be a small design embroidered in a tunic or engraved on a shield. Typical
badge symbols include humans with animal heads, a flower or plant with a crown, or
a weapon with wings.
<P></P>
<B>?? Standard.</B> A standard is a flag with a Y-shaped end, attached to a pole or staff. The
standard bears the colors, heraldic symbols, or insignia of the paladin's
government or church. A standard becomes a <I>banner</I> when the end is cut off to form a square. A smaller version of the standard,
called a <I>pennon</I>, may be attached to the end of a lance.
<P></P>
?? <B>Crest. </B>A crest may be a bundle of short leather strips, one or more feathers, a
wooden carving, a tassel, or any other small object attached to a paladin's helmet.
The crest is usually the same color as the paladin's shield. Crests are often
worn in tournaments to help observers tell one paladin from another, though many
paladins wear their crests all the time. A crest may also be added to the
halter of a war horse. An abstraction of the crest may be displayed on a shield or
standard.
