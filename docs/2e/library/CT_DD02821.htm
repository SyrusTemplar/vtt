<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Mass Combat </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Occasionally, battles will arise that are just too large to play out with the <I>Player?s Option</I> combat system. For example, it can take a long time to resolve a battle when
40 goblins attack the PCs as they negotiate with a dwarven lord and his 15
bodyguards.

You can use the mass combat rules whenever you feel they are necessary.
Generally, if there are more creatures in the battle than will fit on your map, it?s
a good time to use the mass combat rules. It?s usually best to leave PCs and
important NPCs in place on the map and use the normal combat system to resolve
their actions. Use the mass combat rules to determine the outcome of the larger
battle raging around the PCs.
