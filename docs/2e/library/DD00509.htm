These optional rules provide more precision about just what is happening in an
aerial battle. However, these battles require the use of miniatures or
counters and generally take longer to resolve. All of the aerial combat rules above
remain in effect except where specifically contradicted below.

Movement is measured in inches (1 inch = 10 feet of movement) and the pieces
are moved on the tabletop or floor. The maneuverability classes determine how
far a figure can turn in a single round. A protractor is handy for figuring this.
Turns can be made at any point in the round, provided the total number of
degrees turned is not exceeded in the round and there is at least 1 inch of
movement between turns.

<P></P>
Players keep track of the altitude of their flyers by noting the current
altitude on a slip of paper. Like movement, this can be recorded as inches of
altitude. A creature can climb 1 inch for every inch of forward movement.
<P></P>
Creatures of class C and worse have a minimum air speed, and they must spend
at least half their movement rate going forward. Thus, they cannot fly straight
up and can only climb at a maximum of 1/2 their normal movement rate.
<P></P>
Diving creatures gain speed, earning an additional inch to their movement for
every inch they dive, up to their maximum movement rate. Thus, a creature able
to fly 12 could move 24 by diving for its entire movement, since each inch of
diving adds one inch of movement.
<P></P>
A diving creature must fly the full distance it gains diving, although it need
not fly its full normal movement. A creature with a movement of 12 could not
dive 9 and fly only 6 forward. It must move forward at least 9, the distance it
dove.

<P></P>
Since the exact positions of the flying units are marked by miniatures,
several abstractions for aerial combat are not used. Die roll modifiers for
maneuverability are ignored. These simulate the ability of more acrobatic creatures
gaining an advantage over clumsier flyers. When playing with miniatures or
counters, this task is left to the players.
<P></P>
Likewise, the number of rounds required to make a pass are not used, as this
becomes evident from the position of the pieces.
<P></P>
When a diving creature makes an attack, it is considered to be charging.
Charging creatures gain the normal combat bonus. Lances and spears inflict double
damage in a charge. Further, creatures with talons or claws cause double damage
when they hit during a dive.
