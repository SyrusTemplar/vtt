of mind-affecting spells and enchantments. The mentalist is such a character.
Although the mentalist is closely related to the enchanter, the mentalist’s
spells focus more exclusively on the mind. Of course, this is a complicated area of
study, and a great understanding of the human psyche is required for success;
the wizard must have an Intelligence of 15 and Wisdom of 16
(Intelligence/Knowledge and Wisdom/Intuition) to become a mentalist.
<P></P>
The school of mentalism includes spells such as <I>ESP, domination</I>, and <I>suggestion</I>. It is opposed by the schools of alteration and necromancy; a list of the
spells belonging to the school of mentalism appears in <A HREF="DD03717.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03717.htm">Appendix 3</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> .

Mentalists gain the normal benefits and hindrances of a specialist wizard.
When a mentalist reaches 8th level, his saving throw bonus against mentalism
spells and effects increases to +2. At 11th level, the mentalist gains the ability
to <I>detect charm </I>or<I> mental influence </I>three times per day by pointing at the individual to be examined and
concentrating one round. This power resembles the priest spell <I>detect charm</I>, but only one creature can be scanned per use. When the mentalist reaches
14th level, he can <I>dispel charm </I>or mental influence once per day with a 50% chance of success. This is
modified by ±5% per level/Hit Die difference between the mentalist and the caster of
the charm. The mentalist must be within 10 yards of the subject and must
concentrate for one round in order to use this power.
<P></P>
The mentalist is a wizard who deals in subtleties and influences. The
mentalist is not at his best in open battle against hordes of enemies, but he can be an
extraordinarily effective character in investigations or confrontations
against single enemies.
