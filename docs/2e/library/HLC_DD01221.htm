escape or do the same thing to you. An effective combat plan finds a way to use
whatever forms of attack are available in the most efficient manner.

It usually is best to concentrate whatever attacks are available against as
few enemies as possible. Wounding an opponent has little effect in the AD&amp;D game,
because creatures generally function just as well when reduced to a fraction
of their original hit points as they do when completely healthy. It is better to
reduce the opponent?s numbers quickly and in turn reduce the opponent?s
ability to counterattack. Note, however, that being under attack tends to interfere
with spell casting. Neutralizing spellcasters by disrupting their spells is a
great way to limit counterattacks, even if the spellcasters are only wounded.
Also, don?t overlook nonlethal attack forms, such as magical charms, wrestling,
entanglement, disarming, and the like. These modes of attack often limit
counterattacks more effectively than raw damage. The party?s lead fighter might be a
terror, but the character becomes considerably less terrifying when deprived of a
weapon.
