</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">In many AD&amp;D campaigns, ships and boats are the fastest way to travel long
distances. Many kingdoms rely extensively on sea trade and are plagued by pirates
or privateers. Naturally, adventurers tend to get involved in problems like
this. Fighting on a ship first assumes that the attacker can catch and board his
prey.

<B>Encounter Range: </B>Belowdecks, encounter range is limited by the range of vision. Abovedecks,
everything is in range for an encounter. Ships can spot other ships as far as
10â€“15 miles away, depending on their size and the prevailing visibility.
<P></P>
<B>Lines of Fire: </B>Impaired.
<P></P>
<B>Cover: </B>Masts, deckhouses, water-kegs, and gunwhales can all function as hard cover.
Abovedecks, any character is within 1d4 squares of hard cover.
<P></P>
<B>Footing: </B>Normal. Climbing around in rigging is a different matter, though.
<P></P>
<B>Obstacles: </B>Masts, sails, deck cargo, and open hatches can obstruct movement.
<P></P>
<B>Unusual: </B>The sails and masts of a ship are known as its rigging. Moving around in the
rigging is treated like climbing, but there are always ropes or ladders handy.
If a character in the rigging slips or is knocked down, he may fall to the deck
or the sea.
