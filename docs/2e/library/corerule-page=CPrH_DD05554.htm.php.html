<P></P>
This god is the protector of causes and endangered individuals. He's an
appropriate deity for bodyguards, other guardsmen, martyrs, and heroes who espouse
lost causes.
<P></P>
Priests of this god meddle in politics, stand up for noble causes, aggravate
kings and viziers, supply troops to the underdogs of certain fights and wars,
and often provide bodyguards for famous public figures (especially those who are
championing causes) who need them. (This is a great way to get priest-PCs into
interesting adventures.)
<P></P>
Whether or not this god is more likely to be male or female depends on the
culture; if there are few women warriors, then the god is probably male, while if
women are often warriors, the god is just as likely to be female as male.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Community,
Healing, Strength, and War.

<B>Duties of the Priest:</B> Guidance, Marriage. Missions: A priest of this god is almost always on some
sort of mission, a simple one -- to protect a specific person, place, or thing.
The priest might have chosen his current mission, or might have been assigned
to it by his priesthood. That mission might change between adventures, but he's
almost always on one. Note: Priests of this sort do not maintain temples for
small communities; they spend most of their time on mission. Only when they reach
eighth level do they build their own temples and send subordinate priests out
on missions.

<B>Followers and Strongholds:</B> The followers are received at 8th level, and consist of three third-level

Three priests (only one of whom may be third-level) and two fighters. The
priesthood will pay for half of the cost of stronghold construction at 8th level. The

must be constructed so that it can easily repel invasion.

not even throw their spears, javelins, daggers or knives.
