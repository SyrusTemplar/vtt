This spell discovers emanations of evil (or of good in the case of the reverse
spell) from any creature, object, or area. Character alignment is <I>not</I> revealed under most circumstances: Characters who are strongly aligned, do
not stray from their faith, and who are at least 9th level might radiate good or
evil if they are intent upon appropriate actions. Powerful monsters, such as
ki-rin, send forth emanations of evil or good, even if polymorphed. Aligned
undead radiate evil, for it is this power and negative force that enables them to
continue existing. An evilly cursed object or unholy water radiates evil, but a
hidden trap or an unintelligent viper does not. The degree of evil (faint,
moderate, strong, overwhelming) can be noted. Note that priests have a more powerful
version of this spell.

The spell has a path of detection 10 feet wide and 60 yards long in the
direction in which the wizard is facing. The wizard must concentrate--stop, have
quiet, and intently seek to detect the aura--for at least one round to receive a
reading.
