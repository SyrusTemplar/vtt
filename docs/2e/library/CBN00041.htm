</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Sooner or later, wizards who employ black necromancy with some regularity are
noticed by the dark and mysterious deities that patronize such evil sorceries.
In some locales, such as RAVENLOFT, the fabled <I>Realm of Terror</I>, any wizard who employs the Art-whether for good or ill purpose-runs the risk
of attracting the sinister attention of malign entities known only as the Dark
Powers. Like all patrons of forbidden and evil magic, these fiendish gods seek
to subvert mortal spellcasters, turning them into often unwitting instruments
of the gods? will. To further corrupt and entice mortals into their service,
the Dark Powers often grant strange and fabulous abilities to living wizards,
thereby encouraging their continued practice of black necromancy.
<P></P>
Awesome supernatural powers are rarely gained without some terrible, personal
cost to the individual involved. As we shall see in the following chapter, each
beneficial Dark Gift (and even the practice of the Black Arts by itself)
exacts a baneful and unavoidable price on the necromancer. Indeed, the price often
outweighs the merit of the Dark Gift itself. But to the wicked and the
ambitious, the price is of little consequence. Such characters are concerned only with
attaining power and dominion over others, regardless of the actual cost.
<P></P>
The RAVENLOFT rules system (see Chapter Four in the <I>Realm of Terror</I> booklet in the new <I>RAVENLOFT</I> boxed set) already includes detailed provisions for gaining salient abilities
which are expressly granted by the Dark Powers that rule the demi-plane. In
that campaign setting, each time a character employs a necromantic spell (whether
a wizard or priest), there is a flat 1% chance that this act will be noticed
by the demi-plane-s fiendish rulers. The RAVENLOFT rules system does not
distinguish between white or black necromancy-any spells which draw upon a being-s
life force may attract their attention, regardless of the caster-s intent.
However, there is enough latitude in the -powers check? that the DM can increase the
chance of attracting unwanted divine attention, from 1?10%, depending upon the
specific nature of an evil act. Outside of the RAVENLOFT campaign setting, the
DM may wish to retain the concept of the powers check, though it may apply only
when a character willingly practices the Black Arts or employs gray necromancy
for an evil purpose.
<P></P>
Keep in mind that the concept of a powers check only applies to player
characters dabbling in evil affairs beyond their puny mortal understanding. Such
restrictions need not apply to NPCs generated by the DM. Certainly the villainous
and wicked archnemesis of the campaign will have no compunction about willingly
allying him- or herself with the dark and terrible powers from the Lower Planes.
Even if the NPC does not explicitly enter into a specific contract with such
evil powers, however, the necromancer may unknowingly serve their will in the
mortal world, simply by employing the darker aspects of necromancy.
<P></P>
Salient abilities represent a third way in which the DM can bolster an evil
NPC-s repertoire of powers. To preserve game balance, these Dark Gifts should
only be bestowed on rare wizard NPCs who play a pivotal role in the campaign. In
general, the DM should rarely assign more than a few (1?3) special powers to a
single NPC (a good rule of thumb is one salient ability for every four
experience levels of the character). Each special power also incurs a baneful
punishment. Thus a wizard with three salient abilities has three special <A HREF="CBN00073.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="CBN00073.htm">punishments</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> (see Chapter Three for details). In most cases, only one or two special
powers should be sufficient to create a unique and memorable NPC villain for the
campaign. Keep in mind that these salient abilities are intended to provide an
increased challenge (or a nasty surprise) for an experienced party of adventurers.
They are definitely <I>not</I> intended for player characters.
<P></P>
Not just necromancers can benefit from the salient abilities outlined in this
chapter. Death priests (introduced in Chapter Five) are also candidates for
such powers and, because of their allied affiliation, they are unlikely to suffer
from as many punishments as a wizard. This is especially true when the fact
that the powers of a wizard often intrude upon those bestowed upon a priest by his
or her deity is considered.
<P></P>
Because of their strong alliance with the gods that grant such powers, evil
death priests, once they reach at least 9th level in experience, are much more
likely candidates for salient abilities than wizards. For simplicity, in the
power descriptions that follow, references to necromancers should be taken to mean
-necromancers and death priests,- except when stated specifically otherwise.
<P></P>
When creating an NPC with salient abilities, the DM may choose from the
following list or determine the (1?3) powers randomly by rolling 1d20 and consulting <A HREF="CBN00042.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="CBN00042.htm">Table 5</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. Unless stated otherwise, the following abilities can be invoked at will by
the necromancer. While some powers are similar to spells, none of the powers
require any verbal or somatic components. The DM is encouraged to tailor the
following powers to suit the flavor of the campaign.
