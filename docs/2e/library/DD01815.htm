This spell affects any single person it is cast upon. The term <I>person</I> includes any bipedal human, demihuman or humanoid of man-size or smaller,
such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves,
halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs,
pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be
charmed, but an ogre could not.
<P></P>
The person receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect, with any
adjustment due to Wisdom (see <A HREF="DD01434.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01434.htm">Table 5</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">). If the person receives damage from the caster's group in the same round the <I>charm</I> is cast, an additional bonus of +1 per hit point of damage received is added
to the victim's saving throw.
<P></P>
If the spell recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a
trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The spell does not enable the
caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word
or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable way. Thus, a charmed
person would not obey a suicide command, but he might believe the caster if
assured that the only chance to save the caster's life is for the person to hold
back an onrushing red dragon for “just a minute or two.” Note also that the spell
does not endow the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those he normally
possesses (i.e., he must speak the victim's language to communicate his
commands).
<P></P>
The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed person's Intelligence
and is tied to the saving throw. The spell may be broken if a successful saving
throw is rolled, and this saving throw is checked on a periodic basis,
according to the creature's Intelligence (see the following table). If the caster
harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if a <I>dispel magic</I> spell is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the <I>charm</I> spell is broken.
<P></P>
If two or more <I>charm</I> effects simultaneously affect a creature, the result is decided by the DM.
This could range from one effect being clearly dominant, to the subject being
torn by conflicting desires, to new saving throws that could negate both spells.
<P></P>
Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he
was charmed.
