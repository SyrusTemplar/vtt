<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Gem of Insight:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This jewel appears to be a well-cut stone of not less than 5,000 gp value. If
magic is detected for, the gem radiates a faint aura of the enchantment sort.
If any character possesses the item, he will begin to feel its power after
keeping the gem on his person for one week. At the end of two weeks, the individual
will discover that he is able to understand things more easily, have better
insight, memory, recall, etc. In fact, possession of the gem on a continuing basis
(three or more months) raises the Intelligence and Wisdom of the character by
one point each. If for any reason the gem is not kept beyond the three-month
period, the additional Intelligence remains, but the additional Wisdom is lost. A <I>gem of insight</I> functions once every 50 years. If a character acquires a second gem, the
second item has no effect.
