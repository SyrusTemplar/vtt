When this spell is cast, all natural, undressed earth or stone in the area of
effect is softened. Wet earth becomes thick mud; dry earth becomes loose sand
or dirt; and stone becomes soft clay, easily molded or chopped. The priest
affects a 10-foot square area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness
or resilience of the ground at that spot (DM option). Magical or enchanted
stone cannot be affected by this spell, nor can dressed or worked stone.
<P></P>
Creatures attempting to move through an area softened into mud are reduced to
a move of 10 feet per round. Any creatures caught within the mud when the spell
takes effect must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation or lose the ability to
move, attack, or cast spells for 1d2 rounds as they flounder about in the muck.
Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, and creatures are only reduced to
half their normal movement rate, with no chance of being caught for a round or
two. However, it is impossible to run, sprint, or charge over either surface.
<P></P>
Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow
characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect
before. For example, a party of PCs trying to break out of a cavern might use this
spell to soften a wall.
<P></P>
While <I>soften earth and stone </I>does not affect dressed or worked stone, vertical surfaces such as cliff faces
or cavern ceilings can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse
or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face or roof and
falls. A moderate amount of structural damage can be inflicted to man-made
structures by softening the ground beneath a wall or tower, causing it to settle.
However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not
destroyed. The material component is a bit of slip (wet clay) from the wheel of a master
potter.
