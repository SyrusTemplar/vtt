By means of this spell, the wizard conjures up an extradimensional dwelling,
entrance to which can be gained only at a single point of space on the plane
from which the spell was cast. From the entry point, those creatures observing the
area see only a faint shimmering in the air, in an area 4 feet wide and 8 feet
high. The caster of the spell controls entry to the mansion, and the portal is
shut and made invisible behind him when he enters. He may open it again from
his own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they
behold a magnificent foyer and numerous chambers beyond. The place is furnished and
contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to as many dozens
of people as the spellcaster has levels of experience. There is a staff of
near-transparent servants, liveried and obedient, to wait upon all who enter. The
atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
<P></P>
Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside
conditions do not affect the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane
beyond. Rest and relaxation within the place is normal, but the food is not. It
seems excellent and quite filling as long as one is within the place. Once
outside, however, its effects disappear immediately, and if those resting have not
eaten real food within a reasonable time span, ravenous hunger strikes. Failure
to eat normal food immediately results in the onset of fatigue or starvation
penalties as decided by the DM.
<P></P>
The material components of this spell are a miniature portal carved from
ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon. These are utterly
destroyed when the spell is cast.
<P></P>
(It is worth mentioning that this spell has been used in conjunction with a
normal portal, as well as with illusion magic. There is evidence that the design
and interior of the space created can be altered to suit the caster's wishes.)
