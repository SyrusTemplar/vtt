Of course, the guildhouse is the most common type of thieves' den, but nearly
all thieves will require some sort of secret lair from which to conduct their
illicit activities. Dens and guildhouses will vary by size, in relationship to
the number of thieves living or working there; and by obscurity, appropriate to
the level of secrecy the guild needs to maintain in the community.
<P></P>
Some societies expect thieves to flourish in their midst, and among these
cities the guild will often be a large, perhaps even prominent building. Of course,
it is not likely to have a sign posted, describing the building's nature, but
a few discreet inquiries will usually allow one to discover the guildhall. Its
location will certainly be known to the city watch or other law enforcers.
Indeed, sometimes a watch captain or lord-mayor might allow a thieves guild to
function in a known location simply to keep better tabs on it.
<P></P>
But more often the guildhall's location will be a secret, guarded jealously
and ruthlessly by the guild. Likewise, a den or hideout serving as a shelter for
a small group of thieves will have a discreet and carefully protected location.
<P></P>
Privacy can be found underground, of course. Subterranean thieves lairs offer
the advantage that their presence is easily concealed from the outside world.
However, many humans and demi-humans (excluding dwarves, of course) dislike the
chilly, damp nature of underground living quarters. Thieves who risk their
lives to gain objects of value are not likely to hide their wealth and themselves
away in a hole in the ground.
<P></P>
Additionally, the underground lair presents problems in construction. Large
amounts of dirt must be hauled away, much labor is required in order to create a
lair of any size. Both considerations add major difficulties to the secrecy of
lair construction. A wizard with a <I>dig</I> spell, on the other hand, can make the excavation a whole lot easier, but
doesn't solve the problem of dirt disposal.
<P></P>
The easiest type of lair to set up is found in some already existing
structure, or perhaps group of structures. A long row of town houses, for example, might
be interconnected into a single, convoluted guildhouse. Or the attic of some
merchant's shop can be taken by a small band to use as a hideout until they can
get something better. Of course, if the merchant doesn't know about the
thieves, chances of discovery increase dramatically. The best hideouts are buildings
inhabited only by thieves, or by thieves and those who are in league with them.
<P></P>
In some cities it will be necessary for the hideout to maintain some kind of
cover. Perhaps it is enough that the neighbors think it abandoned. Maintaining
this appearance requires diligence on the part of the thieves, however, for a
pattern of noise or light detected from the &quot;abandoned&quot; house will be sure to
arouse suspicions.
<P></P>
If a cover is necessary, often a cooperative merchant or craftsman will labor
in part of the house, maintaining the pretense of a place of business. Such a
worker might even be a thief, but unless he can put forth a reasonable
appearance of knowing his cover occupation, the craftsman and the hideout can both be in
danger.
<P></P>
Guildhouses and dens may also be maintained as private residences. Such
locales are not so likely to be visited by strangers as are cover locations in places
of business. However, the residents of the house will probably be known to the
neighbors, at least by sight. Large numbers of strangers may give rise to
suspicion.
<P></P>
The hideout should ideally have several entrances, at least one of which is a
block or two away from the actual den. A large guildhouse will have several
such access points, usually connected via underground passages or secret corridors
passing through surrounding buildings.
<P></P>
Thus, in a secret guild, the number of people entering and leaving the hall
will not be visible to neighbors or other observers. Indeed, if an access route
is sufficiently torturous, a visitor can be brought into the guild without being
shown the building's exact location. He might know nothing more than that the
guild is within several blocks of a certain alley where he stepped through a
secret trapdoor in the ground.
<P></P>
A major guildhall will also have several built-in traps to deter unwelcome
intruders. If enough thieves man the lair (more than a dozen or so), a full-time
watch will be maintained.
<P></P>
Only the most permanent of thieves' dens will have a built-in vault or storage
chamber for the loot. When such a chamber exists it is only used for the
temporary storage of objects that cannot quickly be fenced. Thieves know only to
well that such storage sites are all too easily penetrated. It is much more likely
that the thieves will maintain their hoard in some other, nearby but secret
location. Of course, thieves who are very brazen about their activities, or very
confident that they face no competition in a given locale, may well keep large
amounts of valuables in their guildhall. Such a hoard might even be a source of
pride to the guild, a sort of challenge to the unwary.
