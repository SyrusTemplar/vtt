This is a small block of wax usually kept in a rigid container to keep it in
one piece—the equivalent of a large snuff-box will do nicely. The thief uses the
wax to record an impression of a key he wants to have duplicated later.
Obviously, the thief can only do this if he has access to a key, at least for a short
time, and if he doesn't wish to take a chance on borrowing the key for a
while. From the wax impression, the thief can have a locksmith make a duplicate of
the original key, or attempt to make one himself using a keymaking set, if he
has one.

With very soft wax, which may need heat-softening on the spot, the thief may
even be able to make a wax impression of such items as heavy seals, which may be
capable of being duplicated later—but an expert will be needed for this kind
of duplication/forgery!
