<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Phobia?Magic:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The character with this fear is nervous about all things magical?spells,
creatures, and items. Although he may wear and use magical items that do not have
visible effects (including magical weapons and armor, rings of protection, and
the like), he will not ingest potions, wear a ring of invisibility, or learn or
cast spells.

If attacked by a magic-wielder using a spell with visible effects, the
character must make a Wisdom/Willpower check or flee as described in the introduction
to the <A HREF="DD03128.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03128.htm">phobia section</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. The appearance of a magical creature, such as a genie, lycanthrope, or
undead, will also force this check.
