does possess significant knowledge about spellcasting. Observing or overhearing a
spell being cast, or a getting a good look at the spell components, lets the
character make a proficiency check. Success means the enchantment is recognized.
Modify the check by +2 if the character can both see and hear, and add another
+2 if the spell components are spotted.
<P></P>
Wizards using this proficiency gain +2 to checks made if the spell being
studied is one from their own specialty or school. Characters with this proficiency
can also make checks to determine if an item is enchanted.
