</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Most characters can make one wrestling attack each round. Wrestling attacks
take place on the attacker’s base initiative phase.
<P></P>
A wrestler makes an attack roll vs. Armor Class 10, regardless of the
defender’s actual Armor Class. Bonuses for the defender’s Dexterity and magical
protections apply. Effects that provide a flat Armor Class, such as magical bracers or
shield spells, count as a +1 bonus regardless of how strong their enchantments
are. If the attacker misses, his action phase ends. If the attacker scores a
critical hit, the defender is automatically held. The attacker enters the
defender’s square and inflicts 1d2 points of damage. The attacker can immediately try
for a lock (see <A HREF="DD02682.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02682.htm">Previously Established Holds</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, below). If there is no critical hit, the attacker enters the defender’s
square and immediately checks for a hold.
