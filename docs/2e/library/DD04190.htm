This spell allows the wizard to surround himself with a portion of his own
life essence, which takes the form of a shimmering aura. The <I>spirit armor</I> offers protection equivalent to splint mail (AC 4) and grants the wizard a +3
bonus to saving throws vs. magical attacks. The <I>spirit armor's</I> effects are not cumulative with other types of armor or magical protection,
but Dexterity bonuses apply.
<P></P>
The <I>spirit armor</I> is effective against magical and nonmagical weapons and attacks. It does not
hinder movement or add weight or encumbrance. It does not interfere with
spellcasting.
<P></P>
When the spell ends, the aura dissipates and the caster temporarily loses a
bit of his life essence, suffering 2d3 points of damage unless he succeeds at a
saving throw vs. spell. No damage is sustained if the save is successful. The
hit points lost can be regained only through magical healing.
