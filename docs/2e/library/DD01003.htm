<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Mirror of Mental Prowess:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This magical mirror resembles an ordinary one 5 feet by 2 feet. The possessor
who knows the proper commands can cause it to perform as follows:
<P></P>
1. Read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, even though these
thoughts are in an unknown language.
<P></P>
2. Scry with it as if it were a <I>crystal ball</I> with <I>clairaudience,</I> even being able to view into other planes if the viewer is sufficiently
familiar with them.
<P></P>
3. Use it as a portal to visit other places (possibly other planes, as well,
at the DM's option) by first scrying them and then stepping through to the place
pictured?an invisible area remains on the &quot;other side,&quot; and those using the
portal can return if the correct spot can be found. (Note that creatures being
scried can step through if the place is found by them!)
<P></P>
4. Once per week it will answer one short question regarding a creature whose
image is shown upon its surface.
