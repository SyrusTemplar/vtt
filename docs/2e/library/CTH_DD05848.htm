Thieves and merchants may possibly come to some negotiated understanding, in
certain cities and towns. The thieves will agree not to burgle particular
establishments (warehouses and private homes)—that is, those which belong to the
merchants who pay a fee for this privilege. Merchants who don't pay will be fair
game for future robbery, and may be specifically targeted.
<P></P>
This kind of agreement will always be negotiated by the guild seniors, and
guild members will be told in no uncertain terms that certain places are strictly
off-limits in the future. Such agreements are most likely in places where the
thieves' guild is strong, the rule of law is fairly weak (or corrupt), and where
the guildmaster is a lawful-aligned individual.
<P></P>
A notable consequence of such agreements is that if a freelance thief burgles
a property which is owned by a merchant who pays the local thieves' guild, that
thief can expect the thieves' guild of the town to make determined efforts to
find him and administer summary justice. This may be harsher than the penalties
prescribed by the law! Also, the traditional meaning of the term &quot;protection
racket&quot;—&quot;pay up or we break your legs&quot;—is not exactly what is implied here,
although thieves denied payment by a merchant might resort to the threat of
violence to drive away the merchant's customers, staff, and the like. Only a guild
dominated by evil and top-heavy with thugs will be likely to use actual violence,
in most cases.
