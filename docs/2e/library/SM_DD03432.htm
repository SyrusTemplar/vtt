Optional Limitations</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
By choosing limitations, a priest character can gain extra character points to
select class abilities, thus balancing out any -overspending? in the previous
step. For example, if a priest selected abilities totalling 135 CPs, he would
be 15 CPs over the normal limit of 120, so he would have to select 15 CPs of
limitations to pay for his additional abilities.
<P></P>
If a priest character begins with a standard package (i.e., the player chooses
to begin with a cleric, crusader, druid, monk, or shaman), he can add new
abilities by taking limitations on a one-for-one basis. For example, a standard
cleric with the wizardly priest advantage must come up with 25 points of
limitations to balance the 25-point ability. The available limitations are as follows:

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Armor restriction (5+): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The priest is limited in his choice of armor. As a 5-point limitation, the
priest is restricted to chain mail or lighter armor; for 10 points, he is limited
to studded leather or lighter armor; and for 15 points, the priest may not wear
any armor at all.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Awkward casting method (5): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Spells cast by the priest are unusually obvious-the priest may be surrounded
by a glowing halo of divine light, he may have to invoke his deity-s power with
peals of thunder and tremors in the ground, or some sensation (fear, cold,
elation) may be noticed by anyone nearby. Any intelligent creature in earshot
automatically notices the priest-s spellcasting, even if they weren-t paying
attention to him before. Casting spells from ambush or without being observed is
nearly impossible with this limitation.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Behavior/taboo (2): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The priest-s religion has an unusual code of behavior or conduct that may
hinder him in certain situations. For example, a priest may be required to speak a
ten-minute prayer every time he crosses a river, which could be very
inconvenient if he was being pursued. Another priest might be required to use cure spells
on anyone in need, expending spells on strangers or NPCs instead of his
companions. A priest who violates his behavior guideline loses access to his spells
and must perform some appropriate penance for his failing.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ceremony/observance (5): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The priest-s faith demands the observance of a special event or ceremony every
day, such as a prayer at sunrise, a small sacrifice or libation performed in a
certain way, or a lengthy atonement for the day-s thoughts and actions. The
priest must drop whatever he is doing to perform the ceremony; there are no
excuses for missing it. A priest who skips the ceremony may lose his memorized
spells or suffer some other sign of his deity-s disfavor until he finds a way to
atone.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Difficult spell acquisition (5): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The priest-s deity is particularly demanding about granting spells, and the
priest can pray for spells only in very specific circumstances. For example, the
priest might only be able to gain spells in a temple of his deity, he might
have to wait for certain celestial alignments or phases of the moon, or he might
be required to fast and pray for a minimum of three days before gaining spells.
In general, this limitation should make it hard for the priest to gain spells
while traveling or adventuring.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fanaticism (5): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A priest with this limitation comes from an intolerant faith. Followers of
other powers must convert or forfeit their lives. The priest absolutely refuses to
accept any companion who does not worship the power he represents and suffers
a ?4 reaction adjustment with any NPCs not of his faith-the priest can-t hide
his contempt for nonbelievers.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hazardous spells (10): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Channeling the power of a deity can be dangerous, and a priest with this
limitation can sustain harmful side-effects from casting spells. The priest might
suffer 1 point of damage per spell level when he casts a spell, with a saving
throw vs. breath weapon for half damage. Another option would be a chance (5% per
spell level, ?2% per character level, minimum 1%) of losing all spells in
memory and being feebleminded for 1d3 days.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Limited magical item use (5+): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The priest is banned from using certain types of magical items. For each
category of magical item he cannot use, he gains a 5-point limitation. The
categories are: potions, oils, and scrolls; rings; rods, staves, and wands;
miscellaneous magic; and weapons and armor.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Limited spell selection (5): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The prayers required to petition the priest-s deity for spells are extremely
complex. In fact, they are as complex as a wizard-s spells, and as a result the
priest is required to build a -spell book? of priest spells. First, this limits
the priest to a maximum number of spells per level, as indicated by his
Intelligence score. Secondly, the priest must make a learn spells roll in order to
add a new spell to his selection; if the priest fails to learn a spell, he may
not try to learn it again until he gains another level.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Reduced hit points (10/20): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A priest with this limitation uses a smaller Hit Die than normal. For 10
points, the priest uses a d6 Hit Die; for 20 points, the priest uses a d4 Hit Die.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Reduced spell progression (15): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A priest with this restriction memorizes one less spell of each level than
normal; a 1st-level priest gains 0 1st-level spells instead of 1, and so on. If
the priest-s spell allocation for any given level is reduced to 0 by this
limitation (like the 1st-level priest above), he gains no bonus spells for an
exceptional Wisdom score for that character level.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Slower casting times (5): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The priest-s spells are unusually long-winded; all casting times are increased
by 3. A casting time of one round or longer is simply doubled.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Talisman/symbol (8): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The priest-s spell powers are focused through one specific talisman or holy
symbol. Without this symbol, he is incapable of casting spells. If his talisman
is destroyed or stolen with no hope of recovery, he may create a new one with
1d4 weeks of prayer, meditation, and fasting in his home temple.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon restriction (5/15): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Unless otherwise stated, a priest character has access to the cleric-s weapon
selection of any Type B weapon. A priest with this limitation is further
restricted to the staff, club, war hammer, horseman-s mace, and horseman-s flail. For
15 points, the priest is not allowed to gain proficiency in any weapon.
