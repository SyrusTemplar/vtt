Spells such as <I>monster summoning</I> and<I> conjure elemental</I> can be especially vulnerable to defensive spells such as <I>protection from evil</I>. These spells are very potent in a duel, forming constructs that conduct
character combat upon reaching the opposing spellcaster. The opponent cannot cast
any spells except counter spells while a summoning spell occupies his space. He
must fight using his power score. Some spells, however, have special abilities
that allow them to be used as counter spells against this type of magic.
<P></P>
The summoning spell uses its power score in the battle, and if it succeeds it
inflicts 1d6 points of damage per spell level and remains to fight again. If
the opponent wins, the summoning spell is destroyed. If a lock occurs, the
character suffers no damage, but the summoning spell remains and attacks again the
next roundâ€”a lock does not destroy a summoning spell as it does in normal
character vs. spell combat.
