Channelling
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Every time a priest casts a spell, he touches a small portion of the infinite.
The unimaginable power of a deity pours into his body and is directed into a
spell effect. But the mortal frame was not meant to contain such energies, and
the priest risks exhaustion or even death by calling on his god?s power too
frequently.
<P></P>
The same rules described for channelling wizards apply to a channelling
priest. The priest gains spell points as described above, allocates them to fixed or
free theurgies, and selects the spells he wants to have locked into memory as
fixed theurgies. Free theurgies may be used to provide the priest with access to
any spell in his repertoire, although they?re more expensive than fixed slots.
The priest may exceed his normal spell level limit or cast spells for greater
effect, although his deity may choose not to grant him these enhanced powers.
The priest modifies his spell point total based on his Constitution score; the
character?s hit point adjustment for Constitution is added to or subtracted from
his spell point total. If this lowers a 1st-level priest to less than 4 spell
points, he ignores the adjustments; all priests have at least 4 spell points.
<P></P>
While the priest may have spell points ?allocated? or ?tied up? in fixed and
free theurgies, this makes no difference for a channeller. His selection of
spells simply creates a slate of spell powers which the character can access and
defines the cost in spell points for making use of these powers. The character
may cast any spell that he has available through either a fixed or free slot
normally, except that the spell slot does not vanish from his memory once he?s cast
the spell. Instead, the character deducts the number of spell points required
to energize the spell from his spell point total.
<P></P>
Spell points in this system represent magical stamina. They are recovered as
the character?s fatigue fades and his strength returns.

Spell points are recovered as shown on <A HREF="DD03520.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03520.htm">Table 20</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> .
<P></P>
In addition to the depletion of spell points, channelling also causes
immediate fatigue effects. Refer to <A HREF="DD03521.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03521.htm">Table 21</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> and the fatigue rules that follow. Note that the effective level of a spell
may be higher than its true level, especially if the priest makes use of a spell
from a minor sphere of access or casts a spell at a greater than normal
effectiveness by paying extra spell points to do so. Consider quest spells to be two
spell levels higher than the caster can cast for purposes of caster fatigue and
exhaustion.
