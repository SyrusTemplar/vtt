There are two interesting approaches to having a gladiator-based campaign.
<P></P>
You could have a campaign centered around the gladiatorial arena. Each
character is a different type of gladiator: One novice, one square-jawed hero adept at
everything, several gladiators each specializing in one interesting weapons
combination. The campaign deals with the hero-gladiators in their efforts to
survive not only the arena but the plotting and trickery of gladiators belonging to
a rival patron.
<P></P>
In one adventure, the enemies might drug our heroes' food before the heroes
are due to fight some particularly fierce monster on the sands; if the heroes
fight, they are in extra danger because of the drug's effects, and if they do not
fight, they lose considerable audience popularity and political clout.
<P></P>
In another adventure, a popular slave-gladiator leads a rebellion; do our
heroes, if they're free gladiators, help the rebellion or help repress it?
<P></P>
In another adventure, the enemy patron manages to frame one or more of the
heroes for an insult they did not perform, and they are challenged to arena-battle
to the death by a group of noble heroes they do not wish to fight . . . and so
on.
<P></P>
However, though many adventures can be generated around the coliseum life,
such a campaign is inherently limited, and will either end fairly soon or branch
out into other adventures.
<P></P>
If you're familiar with Italian sword-and-sandal movies, you know of one way
such a campaign could branch out. In such films, you often have groups of
gladiators and ex-gladiators going out into the world and righting wrongs. When a
city is being bled dry by a tyrannical ruler, the gladiators show up and cast him
down. When the Emperor's daughter is kidnapped and ransomed, the Emperor
doesn't call on his crack guardsmen; he asks the gladiators to rescue the princess.
<P></P>
Such adventures often have a lot of broad comedy in them. Gladiators usually
have fierce unarmed-combat abilities so that they don't have to kill
common-grunt guardsmen in every tavern brawl.
