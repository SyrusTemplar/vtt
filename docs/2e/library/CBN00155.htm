</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Tomes of power, forbidden books, and ancient, long-dead sages can help bring
an atmosphere of necromantic tradition to the campaign, a historical perspective
that adds another dimension of realism for your players. Among the early
writers of the Cthulhu cycle, it was almost mandatory to create a book of
necromantic secrets.
<P></P>
H. P. Lovecraft had such success with his fictional <I>Necronomicon</I>, from which he “quoted” so accurately, that many of his readers believed that
the book existed, convinced by Lovecraft’s stories that it had been penned by
the Arab Alhazred before he was driven mad with his own revelations. Clark
Ashton Smith retorted by creating the <I>Book of Eibon</I>, and Robert Bloch invented <I>Mysteries of the Worm</I>, giving it a Latin title (De Vermis Mysteriis) to further bolster its
authenticity. All of these authors heightened the realism of their tales by discussing
their tomes in a historical context of known treatises on necromancy, such as
the <I>Book of Secrets</I> by Albertus Magnus, or the Egyptian <I>Book of the Dead.
<P></P>
</I> These same techniques work surprisingly well in an AD&amp;D® campaign. How often
does a party of adventurers stumble across the private study of an evil
necromancer and scan the shelves for an interesting title? In my experience, this has
happened many times, and the most successful DMs have had a few clever
descriptions prepared to intrigue their players. Obviously, we are not suggesting that
the DM invent a whole library of necromantic titles and their contents. It is
sufficient to make up a few books and refer to these frequently so that the
players quickly come to recognize them as symbols of necromantic lore.
<P></P>
Here, then, is a small sample of what a group of adventurers might find on the
bookshelves of a powerful necromancer. These books can be used as an item of
treasure for a successful raiding party, or the object of a quest by the
adventurers, who may seek to recover some of the ancient lore contained therein.
<P></P>
Note that many of these books contain knowledge about evil, extraplanar
creatures or black necromancy. Although many of the evil-aligned magical tomes in the
DMG carry powerful wardings to prevent their use by good characters, there is
no such magical protection for the books mentioned here, unless a trap has been
set by the book’s current owner as a deterrent to theft. Instead, feel free to
use the system of punishments outlined in Chapter Three whenever a good
character willingly uses an evil tome mentioned in this section. Of course, all of
these books (whether good or evil) will be widely sought after by necromancers,
and if one of the tomes happens to be in the party’s possession at the time,
they could be in store for a nasty encounter or perhaps even a new adventure.
<P></P>
<B>The Art of Necromancy.</B> This heavy tome was penned by Kazerabet, the former queen of an entire undead
principality and a renowned scholar of the ancient Necromancer Kings of the
Ruined Kingdoms. This book contains many useful necromantic spells (gray a nd
white necromancy mostly) and also descriptions on how to create and recharge
various necromantic magical items (as alluded to previously in this chapter). The
book includes an encyclopedic description of undead, along with a discussion of
their special powers and weaknesses. Finally, the book ends with a translation
dictionary for Kadari, the ancient language of the Necromancer Kings. Wizards
who read the <I>Art of Necromancy</I> can learn necrology and ancient languages (Kadari) as bonus nonweapon
proficiencies (see Chapter One) at a rate of one proficiency for every 1–4 months of
the character’s studying.
<P></P>
<B>The Book of Shadows.</B> It is said that Nebt Bhakau dictated this account of black necromancy to his
summoned shadow familiars while he lay in an oubliette before his execution.
After his death, copies of this book started to appear in nearby cities, and
although all available copies were promptly burned and the book was banned by the
local authorities, it is a widely known fact that some copies escaped the
interdiction. The book is a thorough treatise on the Black Arts, and includes all of
the baneful spells listed on Table 7 on page 46.
<P></P>
Of more interest, perhaps, to the Undead Master especially, the book also
contains many of the secret rites necessary to raise up crawling claws, enslave
evil genies, summon fiendish familiars from the Outer Planes, and subjugate
skeleton warriors. Wizards who read this book carefully gain a +1 bonus on their
netherworld knowledge nonweapon proficiency check.
<P></P>
<B>On Coming Forth By Day.</B> This clerical tome has been compiled over countless generations by the
priests of the Dead, and contains a description (but not the actual secrets) of all
clerical spells from the necromantic sphere. It also contains the procedure for
fashioning scarabs of protection by a priest of at least 9th level.
<P></P>
Any priest who reads this magical tome and ponders its contents for over a
month gains minor access to the necromantic sphere (if she or he had none before)
or major access to the necromantic sphere (if he or she had only minor access
before). A priest who already has major access to the sphere achieves an
improved understanding of necromantic spells, gaining a permanent +1 bonus on his or
her saving throws against these spells (whether cast by a wizard or priest).
<P></P>
<B>The Necrophidicon.</B> This thin, magical volume is a specialized <I>manual of golems</I> that can be used to create a necrophidius (a type of golem described in full
in the <I>Monstrous Manual</I>). Normally, the process requires a wizard of at least 14th level (or a priest
of at least 9th level), approximately 10 days of labor, and at least 8,000 gp
in materials.
<P></P>
If the wizard or priest is not sufficiently powerful, he or she may invoke the
necessary incantations from the book, although this destroys the <I>Necrophidicon </I>in the process (the manufacture of the golem still takes the same amount of
time and cost in materials). Many of these tomes were also used as notebooks by
skilled necromancers and death priests and may contain the secrets of creating
other kinds of necromantic golems.
<P></P>
<B>The Nycoptic Manuscripts.</B> These twin papyrus scrolls are inscribed with ancient tales and cryptic
prophesies by an anonymous author who was probably (at least partially) insane.
Despite their dubious accuracy, the manuscripts contain many useful descriptions of
necromantic spells (both priest and wizard) and magical items, particularly
those incantations and devices that affect a person’s life force. The details of
such spells and items are not present, but the manuscripts can be used to cut
the time and expense for researching these topics in half. <I>The Manuscripts</I> are thus an invaluable tool of necromantic research and, as such, are highly
prized by both necromancers and death priests. Some spellcasters—once their
sanity has faded from reading the <I>Manuscripts </I>too many times—are said to at last understand the author’s doomsday
prophesies. Finally, the <I>Manuscripts</I> supposedly contain the full rite of creating an <I>undead plague</I> (a quest spell outlined in <I>TOM</I>). This powerful incantation can only be comprehended and invoked by a priest
(or necromancer) who has already failed at least one madness check (see Chapter
Three). The spell disappears from the <I>Manuscripts </I>after it has been read, only to reappear when the work passes on to a new
owner.
<P></P>
<B>The Fabric of the Human Body.</B> This oversized book is a comprehensive monograph about the structure and
function of the human body. It is recognized as one of the most thorough and
accurate texts on human anatomy and contains dozens of drawings depicting dissected
cadavers. This work will be found on the shelf of almost any respected
Anatomist. Provided a wizard or priest already has a basic proficiency in healing, he or
she would be able to learn the Anatomy nonweapon proficiency after three
months of study (and at least one dissection of a human cadaver).
<P></P>
<B>The Eleven Baneful Gates.</B> This ancient scroll is thought to contain the secret of immortality,
symbolized by eleven tests or riddles. The work was bestowed by a prophet of the gods
on a wizard-king (perhaps one of the Necromancer Kings). According to legend,
this king sundered his realm after becoming immortal, leaving nothing in his wake
but sand and dust.
<P></P>
Copies of the original are known to exist, and these rare books cover in full
detail the various rites involved in becoming a lich. The process requires a
powerful necromantic potion and a wizard of at least 18th level (in order to
survive the transformation at least). This work is one of the books most coveted by
necromancers and would-be liches alike.
