<FONT SIZE="4"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Tracking</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to his keen senses and thorough
understanding of animal behavior, the ranger is an expert tracker. He
reads an impression in the mud or a bend in a twig like words on a
printed page. He can determine the identity of his quarry and how
fast it was traveling by the depth of a footprint. He can tell the
size of a slug from the trail of slime it left behind. He can track
an orc in the darkest forest, a rabbit though the thickest jungle, an
escaped convict across the most desolate mountain range.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;A ranger's tracking skills apply to
characters as well as creatures, and to underground and interior
settings as well as all types of outdoor environments. His tracking
skills are inherent; that is, he receives the Tracking nonweapon
proficiency automatically at the outset of his career, expending no
proficiency slots.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Pre-Conditions</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A ranger can't just track anything, any
time he likes. In order to track a particular quarry, the following
conditions must be met:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>1. The quarry must be capable of
leaving a physical trail.</B> Elements of a trail may include
footprints, bent twigs, waste matter, or any other physical signs
that a ranger can follow. Certain categories of creatures--including
swimming and flying creatures, small insects, and ghosts and other
non-corporeal creatures--seldom leave physical evidence of their
passage. In most cases, such creatures can't be tracked. However,
since tracking involves all the senses, not just sight, it's possible
that the aroma of burning metal might linger after the passage of a
particular spectre, or a ghost might reveal itself by its eerie
voice, heard faintly in the distance. Still, only the most skilled
rangers are capable of following trails devoid of physical evidence,
and the DM should allow such tracking in only the rarest of circumstances.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>2. The ranger must be able to find the trail.</B>
If the trail is outdoors, the ranger must actually see the creature
(he spots a fox darting into the brush), notice obvious signs of his
quarry (such as footprints or droppings), or hear reliable reports of
the quarry's whereabouts (&quot;Looking for that old silver dragon?
She likes to drink from the pond by the twin palm trees.&quot;). If
the trail is indoors, the ranger himself must have seen the quarry
within the last 30 minutes, and begin tracking from the location
where the quarry was last seen. As always, the DM is the final
arbiter as to whether the ranger has enough evidence to enable him to
track the quarry.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Tracking Check</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">If the above conditions are met, the ranger can
attempt to trail the quarry by making a Tracking check, using his
Tracking score. The base Tracking score is equivalent to the ranger's
Wisdom. Consult Tables 15-17 for other relevant modifiers; these
tables may be used in place of Table 39 in Chapter 5 of the <I>Player's
Handbook</I>. In non-natural surroundings, the Tracking chances are halved.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Should the ranger exceed the movement
rate in Table 18--for instance, if a monster abruptly ambushes him
and he's forced to run--he loses the trail.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The modifiers change.</B> If the trail
leads to a new terrain type, night falls, or any other change occurs
that requires a new Tracking modifier (as described in Tables 15-17),
the ranger loses the trail. The new conditions may dictate the use of
modifiers reflecting a trail that is easier to follow, not more
difficult, and DMs should consider applying a bonus in such
conditions. Nevertheless, the new roll must still be made.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>A second track crosses the first. </B>Crossed
trails mingle the physical signs of each, making tracking difficult.
The DM determines if such a situation exists. If so, the ranger's
efforts fail. (If the ranger wishes to continue tracking, as
described below, he must decide which of the crossed trails to follow.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The ranger becomes distracted.</B> An
attack from a monster may interrupt the ranger's progress. Further,
the ranger may intentionally choose to stop if he needs to rest, eat,
or hold a discussion with his companions. Any of these interruptions
qualifies as a distraction.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; When any of these conditions occur, the
ranger loses the trail. To continue tracking the quarry, he must
spend at least an hour exploring the immediate area for new signs of
the trail. After an hour of searching, he makes a new Tracking check,
based on a Tracking score calculated from the new conditions (if the
illumination has changed from daylight to twilight, he must now
modify his Tracking score by -3). If other trackers assist the
ranger, modify the tracking check by +1 per assistant; add the bonus
to the Tracking score of the most adept tracker. This bonus is
limited to +1 per 3 levels of the ranger (round up). If the check
succeeds, the ranger may continue following the trail as before. If
he fails the check, he has lost the trail for good.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Identification Check</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">By noticing details that other characters might
overlook--the depth of a footprint, the thickness of a snapped
branch, a hair caught in barbed bush--the ranger can deduce a
sizeable amount of information about his quarry. The more skilled the
ranger, the more information he deduces.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever a ranger makes a successful
Tracking check, he may then attempt an Identification check. The
Identification check uses the same score and modifiers as the
Tracking check; essentially, the Identification check is a second
Tracking check.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Identification check is
successful, the DM provides the ranger with some information about
the quarry based on the guidelines in Table 19. The ranger's
experience level determines the type of information he receives. The
information is cumulative; that is, a 6th-level ranger who makes a
successful Identification check receives all types of information
available to rangers of level 6 and below.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The DM provides only general information,
not exact details. At his discretion, the DM may give more precise or
less specific information than suggested in Table 19. The information
may be ambiguous (&quot;The tracks resemble those of a large bird,
though they could have been made by some sort of reptilian
creature.&quot;) but the DM shouldn't intentionally mislead the
ranger (for instance, by telling him the tracks were definitely made
by a bird when in fact they were made by a reptile). The
parenthetical comments in Table 19 indicate how a DM might respond to
a ranger studying tracks that were made by a pair of juvenile red
dragons, each with a human rider.</FONT></P>

movement of others, he's also adept at concealing his own trail. If a
ranger moves at half his normal movement rate, he may cover his
footprints, avoid snapping twigs, and execute similar actions
necessary to conceal his trail. When other characters, rangers
included, attempt to track a ranger who has concealed his trail, they
do so at a -5 penalty to their Tracking scores. (If a
terrain-specialized ranger concealed his trail while moving through
his primary terrain, others suffer a -7 penalty to their Tracking scores.)</FONT></P>
