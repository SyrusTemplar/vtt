This powerful spell enables the priest casting it to imbue inanimate objects
with mobility and a semblance of life. The animated object, or objects, then
attacks whomever or whatever the priest first designates. The animated object can
be of any nonmagical material whatsoever[md]wood, metal, stone, fabric,
leather, ceramic, glass, etc. Attempting to animate an object in someone's possession
grants that person a saving throw to prevent the spell's effect. The speed of
movement of the object depends on its means of propulsion and its weight. A
large wooden table would be rather heavy, but its legs would give it speed. A rug
could only slither along. A jar would roll. Thus a large stone pedestal would
rock forward at 10 feet per round, a stone statue would move at 40 feet per
round, a wooden statue 80 feet per round, an ivory stool of light weight would move
at 120 feet per round. Slithering movement is about 10 feet to 20 feet per
round; rolling is 30 feet to 60 feet per round. The damage caused by the attack of
an animated object depends on its form and composition. Light, supple objects
can only obscure vision, obstruct movement, bind, trip, smother, etc. Light,
hard objects can fall upon or otherwise strike for 1d2 points of damage or
possibly obstruct and trip, as do light, supple objects. Hard, medium-weight objects
can crush or strike for 2d4 points of damage, while larger and heavier objects
may inflict 3d4, 4d4, or even 5d4 points of damage.

The frequency of attack of animated objects depends on their method of
locomotion, appendages, and method of attack. This varies from as seldom as once every
five melee rounds to as frequently as once per round. The Armor Class of the
object per round. The Armor Class of the object animated is basically a function
of material and movement ability. Damage depends on the type of weapon is
effective against fabric, leather, wood, and like substances. Heavy smashing and
crushing weapons are useful against wood, stone, and metal objects. Your DM will
determine all of these factors, as well as how much damage the animated object
can sustain before being destroyed. The priest can animate one cubic foot of
material for each experience level he has attained. Thus, a 14th-level priest
could animate one or more objects whose solid volume did not exceed 14 cubic
feet[md]a large statue, two rugs, three chairs, or a dozen average crocks.
