The Spell Component List
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There are a couple of classes of item deliberately not included on <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03505.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03505.htm.php.html">Table 16</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> : items that already have a listed cost in the spell description (the special
dust mixture of <I>Leomund’s trap</I>, or the 100 gp pearl required for <I>identify</I>, for instance) and items that are chosen or customized at the time of the
spell. For example, the spell <I>banishment </I>requires the use of materials “harmful, hateful, or opposed to the nature of
the subject of the spell.” Since this could consist of a wide variety of
substances, <I>banishment’s </I>material components weren’t included on the list.
<P></P>
The spell components are divided into several categories, reflecting their
general nature and origins. These include: Miniatures and Models; Finished or
Refined Items; Minerals; Common or Household Items; Animal Specimens; Plant
Specimens; and Other, a catch-all for anything that doesn’t clearly fit in another
category.
<P></P>
Each item has a note concerning its method of acquisition. Items are listed as
FS (Field Search), TM (Town or market), SO (Special Order), or Auto (items
that can automatically be found by anyone willing to look for a few minutes.) A
few items are both field search and town or market, meaning that a wizard can try
to buy the material if he can’t find it for himself.
<P></P>
Scarcity is listed for items that wizards might search for or try to purchase,
and a cost for items that the wizard might want to purchase. Also, items that
are commonly available in the wizard’s own laboratory are noted. Finally, items
like the various dusts are priced with one spell use in mind. For example, if
a wizard wishes to have enough powdered amber to cast two spells, he needs to
come up with 80 gold pieces (40 x 2).
<P></P>
Note that the cost of an item can vary wildly with the circumstances. Buying
coffin wood in a kingdom where the interment of the dead is considered the sole
and sacred province of a fanatical religious sect could be far more difficult
than a stroll down to the undertaker’s place of business! Similarly, tolls,
finder’s fees, and all kinds of surcharges could come into play for strange or
exotic items.
<P></P>
In addition to the problems of cost, some special-order items may take quite
some time to locate. For example, finding a 100-year-old map to tear to pieces
could be quite difficult. Even the most dedicated book-buyer, herbalist, or
apothecary may have to wait several weeks for something to turn up. Some special
items may not be available for any price, and the wizard may have to locate these
items personally if he wishes to cast the spells in question.

who can handle the acquisition of components. For instance, the wizard might
hire a couple of local children to collect various insects or herbs. Unless the
assistants are well-trained, at least 75% of the material they bring back will
be unusable due to small imperfections or taints, but for simple materials an
assistant can save the wizard a lot of time. Apprentices are often assigned to
these duties, both to learn what makes for a good spell component, and to save
their masters the time of stalking through a field, looking for a cricket or
mouse that will let itself be captured.
