The gardener views the world as a garden: It needs loving care and someone to
cut down the weeds. The character remains very much aware of her
responsibilities as a druid. A deep love for the land--with all its animals and
people--drives her to take decisive action to nurture and protect it.
<P></P>
A gardener believes a druid should actively intervene to promote the goals of
the druidic order. She won't isolate herself in a grove in the wilderness. On
the other hand, she usually stays in a particular region or country, feeling a
close kinship to her own land, and knowing that she cannot take responsibility
for the entire world.
<P></P>
The gardener sees combat as a job that sometimes has to be done: Avoid the
unnecessary battles, but win the necessary ones. She uses her head when she
fights, trying whatever tricks and tactics might give her an edge. However, she does
not believe the ends justify the means and will not resort to strategies that
go against the druidic ethos or her own conscience.
<P></P>
The character will see other people's points of view. Nevertheless, she lives
devoted to the druidic ethos and actively carries the fight against anyone who
threatens the land she holds dear.
<P></P>
The gardener personality is common among druids. It suits the Adviser, Savage,
Wanderer, and Village Druid kits, but avoid using it with the Guardian kit--a
gardener doesn't limit her attention to just one area.
