slightly, have low, jutting foreheads, snouts, canine teeth, and short pointed
ears. They stand between five and a half and six feet tall, and often have
powerful, stocky builds. Orcs are aggressive hunters and raiders who constantly seek
to expand their territory at the expense of their neighbors.

Orcs respect skill in battle, and from time to time an orc champion approaches
human standards of bravery and honor in battle. A player character orc is one
of these heroes. Even the best orcs are quick to take offense and are somewhat
bloodthirsty.
