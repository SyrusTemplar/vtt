The <I>summon insects</I> spell attracts a cloud or swarm of normal insects to attack the foes of the
caster. Flying insects appear 70% of the time, while crawling insects appear 30%
of the time. The exact insects called are bees, biting flies, hornets, or
wasps, if flying insects are indicated; biting ants or pinching beetles, if
crawling insects are indicated. A cloud of the flying type, or a swarm of the crawling
sort, appears after the spell is cast. This gathers at a point chosen by the
caster, within the spell's range, and attacks any single creature the caster
points to.
<P></P>
The attacked creature sustains 2 points of damage if it does nothing but
attempt to flee or fend off the insects during the time it is attacked; it suffers 4
points of damage per round otherwise. If the insects are ignored, the victim
fights with a -2 penalty to his attack roll and a +2 penalty to his Armor Class.
If he attempts to cast a spell, an initiative roll should be made for the
insects to see if their damage occurs before the spell is cast. If it does, the
victim's concentration is ruined and the spell is lost.
<P></P>
The insects disperse and the spell ends if the victim enters thick smoke or
hot flames. Besides being driven off by smoke or hot flames, the swarm might
possibly be outrun, or evaded by plunging into a sufficient body of water. If
evaded, the summoned insects can be sent against another opponent, but there will be
at least a 1 round delay while they leave the former opponent and attack the
new victim. Crawling insects can travel only about 10 feet per round (maximum
speed over smooth ground) and flying insects travel 60 feet per round. The caster
must concentrate to maintain the swarm; it dissipates if he moves or is
disturbed.
<P></P>
It is possible, in underground situations, that the caster might summon 1d4
giant ants by means of the spell, but the possibility is only 30% unless giant
ants are nearby. This spell does not function under water.
<P></P>
The materials needed for this spell are the caster's holy symbol, a flower
petal, and a bit of mud or wet clay.
