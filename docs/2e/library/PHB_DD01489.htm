Historically, druids lived among the Germanic tribes of Western Europe and
Britain during the days of the Roman Empire. They acted as advisors to chieftains
and held great influence over the tribesmen. Central to their thinking was the
belief that the earth was the mother and source of all life. They revered many
natural things -- the sun, moon, and certain trees -- as deities. Druids in the
AD&amp;D game, however, are only loosely patterned after these historical figures.
They are not required to behave like or follow the beliefs of historical
druids.

The druid is an example of a priest designed for a specific mythos. His powers
and beliefs are different from those of the cleric. The druid is a priest of
nature and guardian of the wilderness, be it forest, plains, or jungle.
