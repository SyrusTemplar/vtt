<B>Character Description:</B> Many believe that the wizard is the most powerful of all mortals-- the
Intimidator is convinced of it. Radiating power and confidence, the Intimidator faces
all challenges head on. There's no opponent too tough and no obstacle too
difficult for him. His access to magic makes him superior to all others-- at least<I> he</I> believes this to be fact. His reaction to common people-- that is, people who
cannot cast spells-- ranges from sympathy to impatience, but as long as they
acknowledge his superiority, he can tolerate them.
<P></P>
Usually, this amount of confidence evolves over many years, so most
Intimidators are mid-level or high-level wizards. But an especially powerful or an
especially arrogant lower-level wizard might easily be an Intimidator.
<P></P>
An inflated ego alone is not enough-- this personality type is primarily
intended for wizards who are in fact more powerful than their contemporaries. To
qualify as an Intimidator, a wizard should have higher than normal scores in at
least two abilities other than Intelligence (for instance, a wizard with Strength
and Charisma scores of 12 or more would be a good candidate for an
Intimidator). However, even if a character lacks exceptional abilities, he might still be
an Intimidator if he has a reputation as a no-nonsense aggressor and has the
personality to match.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Best Suited For:</B> The Intimidator is suited to any alignment, though characters of neutral and
chaotic alignments might make better egomaniacs; neutral good, neutral evil,
chaotic good, and chaotic neutral are all appropriate choices.
<P></P>
Any kits that suggest aggressive, grim characters are good for the
Intimidator, with the Savage Wizard and the Militant Wizard being obvious choices. More
passive types, such as the Mystic and Academician, are less appropriate for the
Intimidator.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>In Combat Situations:</B> The Intimidator loves nothing more than a good fight. He is a shrewd,
dangerous opponent bent on extinguishing every one of his enemies.
<P></P>
Although he does not attack recklessly, the Intimidator prefers to face off
with the most formidable opponent on the battlefield. Where some wizards might use<I> fireball</I> to frighten a group of opponents by sailing it over their heads, the
Intimidator would scare them by firing it directly at their leader, incinerating him.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>In Role-Playing Situations:</B> The Intimidator is accustomed to getting his way. If reason fails, he will
threaten, frighten, or otherwise intimidate NPCs to get their cooperation, unless
a player character companion intervenes.
<P></P>
The Intimidator is a man of few words. He knows that a snarl or a stare can be
a much more effective way to coerce uncooperative NPCs than long speeches or
kind words. Needless to say, the Intimidator is not especially adept at delicate
negotiations.
<P></P>
In a campaign, all player characters will respect the Intimidator, but he's
likely to associate only with player characters he sees as peers, such as
high-level warriors and other wizards. The Intimidator will tend to be patronizing and
condescending to the rest of the party, treating them as well-meaning
children, incompetent bumblers, or outright irritants
