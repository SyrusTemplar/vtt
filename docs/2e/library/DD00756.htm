</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> All scroll spells are written to make use as quick and easy as possible for
the writer. The level of the spell and its characteristics (range, duration, area
of effect, etc.) are typically one level higher than that required to cast the
spell, but never below 6th level of experience.
<P></P>
Thus, a 6th-level wizard spell is written at 13th level of ability, a
7th-level spell at 15th level, etc. The DM can make scroll spells more powerful by
increasing the level at which they are written. This will, however, affect the
chance of spell failure.
