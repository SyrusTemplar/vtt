<FONT SIZE="3">In the game world of wizards, there are two
significant additions--wild magic and elementalists. Wild magic is a
strange, new type of magical power, just being explored and
discovered for the first time. Wild mages are rare and exotic. Long
before encountering such a wizard, characters may hear tell of a new
type of magic in reports from travelers to distant lands. Of course,
every adventurer knows that these reports tend to be
exaggerated--more fiction than fact.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The first appearance of a wild mage is best presented
by the DM as a mysterious NPC. The wild mage may join the party
briefly or may be the springboard for an adventure. He should not be
a henchman or hireling, but someone who is the characters' equal or
superior. This gives players the opportunity to experience the
wonders (and terrors) of wild magic before immersing themselves in
this new art. After the characters have learned something of this
strange magic, wild mage player characters may be introduced, perhaps
as apprentices of the same NPC. Gradually, these new mages will
become accepted members of the campaign world.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Elementalists can be introduced in a similar fashion,
although their arrival is likely to be less mysterious. The first
appearance of the specialization could be a small school or guild in
a nearby town, established by an elementalist from distant lands
(where such magic is common). The newly established wizard is likely
to be looking for an apprentice; new characters are eligible to join
the school. Of course, established mages may take an interest (both
positive and negative) in his activities.</FONT></P>
