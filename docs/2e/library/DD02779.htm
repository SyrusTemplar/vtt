<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This construction is also called a belfry. It consists of a framework mounted
on wheels and covered with thick planks and a layer of hides soaked in water
(to make the structure flame resistant). The whole tower is about 40 feet high.
Inside, a siege tower has three stories: The ground floor is about 15 feet
square. Creatures on this floor are protected as if they were in a gallery shed (<A HREF="DD02772.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02772.htm">see above</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). The second story is 30 feet from the ground. This story is equipped either
with three arrow slits where troops armed with bows or crossbows can fire out
with 90% cover, or a 10- to 15-foot drawbridge that can be lowered to provide
quick access to the top of a wall. While the drawbridge is up, troops on the
second story have 100% cover.
<P></P>
The third story is a partially enclosed deck about 10 feet square. Creatures
on the deck have the same benefits as creatures behind a mantlet.
<P></P>
Six Man-sized creatures working within the bottom story can push a siege tower
as though they were severely encumbered. Six more Man-sized creatures can push
from behind the tower and the team of 12 can move as though heavily
encumbered. Like a wheeled gallery shed, a siege tower cannot cross rough terrain or
moderate slopes.
