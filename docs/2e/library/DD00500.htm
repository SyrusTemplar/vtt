There are occasions when death is unavoidable, no matter how many hit points a
character has.
<P></P>
A character could be locked in a room with no exits, with a 50-ton ceiling
descending to crush him. He could be trapped in an escape-proof box filled with
acid. These examples are extreme (and extremely grisly), but they could happen in
a fantasy world.
<P></P>
As a general guideline, inescapable deaths should be avoided--characters
always should have some chance to escape a hopeless situation, preferably by using
common sense and intelligence. This maintains the interest of the players and
helps them retain their trust in the DM.
<P></P>
However, if a situation of inescapable death occurs, the character dies, and
there is no need to play such a situation out round-by-round. Allow the player
to attempt reasonable (and perhaps even truly heroic) methods of escape. If
these fail, simply inform the player of the demise of his character. The doomed
character is assumed to have lost all hit points.
