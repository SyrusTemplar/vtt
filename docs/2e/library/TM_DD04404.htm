The priest casting a <I>mindnet</I> spell establishes a telepathic link with as many as 10 other creatures who
may be separated from each other by as much as 10 miles. Thus, a chain of
creatures 100 miles long could be established.
<P></P>
The Power granting this spell has the final word on the individuals who may be
included in the spell. Most commonly, the spell will be cast to include
individuals familiar to the caster. However, depending on the purpose of the spell,
the Power may allow a stranger known to the caster only by name to be included
in the <I>mindnet</I>.
<P></P>
Unwilling creatures must make a saving throw at a -4 penalty to avoid being
included in the mindnet.
<P></P>
Casting the spell requires one round per two creatures in the <I>mindnet</I>. The spell's duration begins after all affected creatures have been linked.
Characters of any class may take part in this linkage, benefiting from several
effects.
<P></P>
First, each member of the <I>mindnet</I> benefits from Intelligence, Wisdom, and Dexterity bonuses. The bonuses are
equal to the bonuses held by the member of the <I>mindnet</I> with the highest ability score. For example, if five creatures in a <I>mindnet</I> have Wisdom scores of 15, 15, 16, 17, and 18, each creature would make saving
throws, ability checks, and the like as if he had a Wisdom score of 18. Bonus
spells are not gained due to enhanced Wisdom, however.
<P></P>
Second, spells may be pooled among the spellcasters within the <I>mindnet</I>. Any priest may use a spell memorized by another priest with two conditions:
the priest who has memorized the spell must allow its use; and a priest
&quot;borrowing&quot; a spell may use only spells of levels he could normally cast. Such
borrowing still causes the spell to be lost from the mind of the caster who memorized
it. A caster may not borrow spells outside his normal class restrictions.
Priests and wizards within a <I>mindnet</I> cannot mix their priestly and wizardly spells, nor can a specialist borrow a
spell from an opposition school.
<P></P>
Third, each member of the <I>mindnet</I> is in constant mental communication. Each member knows what is happening at
the locations of all other members.
<P></P>
Finally, twice per turn, the priest casting this spell can instantly teleport
any person linked by the <I>mindnet</I> to any other person who is also a part of the spell. This massive effort
results in a +4 penalty to any Constitution checks made by the priest.
<P></P>
The priest casting the spell cannot perform any other actions while the <I>mindnet</I> exists; if he does, the spell is canceled. The priest must make a
Constitution check at the end of each turn in order to sustain the spell. A failed check
cancels the <I>mindnet</I>. The spell can last a maximum of 12 turns.
