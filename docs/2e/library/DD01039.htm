<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Rope of Constriction:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This rope looks exactly like a <I>rope of climbing</I> or <I>entanglement.</I> As soon as it is commanded to perform some action, however, it lashes itself
about the neck of the character holding it, and from 1d4 others within 10 feet.
Everyone caught by the rope is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. Anyone
failing the saving throw is strangled and crushed (2d6 hit points of damage), and
the rope continues to constrict until a <I>dispel magic</I> is cast upon it.
<P></P>
Creatures entwined by the rope cannot cast spells or free themselves. An
unentangled character can cast a <I>dispel magic</I> or try to cut through the rope-it is AC -2 and takes 22 points of damage to
cut through; all hit points must be inflicted by the same creature (not the one
entangled).
