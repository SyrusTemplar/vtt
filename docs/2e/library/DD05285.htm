</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Low-level characters, with their small store of hit points, are comparatively
easy to hurt in this system. A character with 10 hit points has a Numbing
number of 3 and an Injuring number of 5. However, since these special damage results
are all temporary, and add a certain amount of flavor to combats, you should
have no difficulty using them with characters of any level.
<P></P>
However, don't forget that all these special shots must be Called Shots. They
don't come about because of random die-rolls.
