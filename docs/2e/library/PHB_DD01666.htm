</B> determines the order in which things happen in a combat round. Like so many
things in the world, initiative is determined by a combination of ability,
situation, and chance.

At the start of each round of a battle, an initiative roll is made by both
sides. This roll can be modified by the abilities of the combatants and by the
situation. The person or side with the lower modified die roll acts first.
