<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Bracers of Brachiation:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">These wrist bands appear to be of the ordinary sort, but they enable the
wearer to move by swinging from one tree limb, vine, etc., to another to get from
place to place. The power can be employed only in locales where these sorts of
hand-holds can be found. Movement is at a rate of 3, 6, or 9?the more jungle-like
the conditions, the greater the movement rate.
<P></P>
The wearer is also able to climb trees, vines, poles, ropes, etc., at a rate
of 6, and can swing on a rope, vine, or other dangling, flexible object as if he
were an ape.
<P></P>
The wearer can also jump as if wearing <I>boots of striding and springing,</I> but the jump must culminate in the grasping of a rope or vine, movement
through the upper portion of trees, the climbing of a tree or pole, or some other
activity associated with brachiation.
