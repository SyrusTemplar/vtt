</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>The Bard-s Spell Book: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Bards must keep spell books, just as wizards do, but a bardic spell book is
not the same thing as a wizard spell book. When a bard discovers a spell in a
wizard-s spell book or on a scroll and wishes to copy it into his own spell book,
he may not be able to immediately do so. In fact, at 1st level, the bard only
has a 40% chance to comprehend the wizard spell as it is written. This chance
increases by 5% per level to a maximum of 85% at 10th level. If the bard is able
to make sense of the wizard spell (or uses <I>read magic </I>to read it), he may then attempt to learn the spell and add it to his
repertoire by translating the spell into bardic spell notes.
<P></P>
Translating a spell from wizard notation to bardic notation requires one week
and 100 gp in materials. When the translation is complete, the bard attempts a
learn spells check to see if he can add the spell to his spell book. If the
check fails, he can always wait until he gains a level before examining his notes
again.
<P></P>
Bards add spells to their book only through luck and happenstance. With the
exception of spell translations, bards may not engage in spell research or scroll
research. Bards may only gain access to new spells by using another bard-s
spell book, chancing upon a wizard spell they happen to understand, or translating
a wizard spell they don-t. If the DM is generous, a bardic college or hall
might have bardic spell translations available for trade or purchase.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Bards and Scroll Use: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Normally, bards must wait until 10th level before using wizard scrolls; spells
on scrolls are recorded in a wizard-s notation, and as described earlier, a
bard often can-t make sense of a wizard-s notes. As an optional rule, the DM may
permit the bard character to attempt to read wizard scrolls before 10th level.
His chance of success is 25% at 4th level, plus 10% for each level above 4th,
to a maximum of 85% at 10th level. If the bard fails to read the spell
correctly, the effect may be less (or more!) than expected, or it may affect someone or
something besides its intended target. Obviously, this makes low-level spell
use a very hazardous thing for a bard, but if the character-s willing to take a
chance, he can try it.
