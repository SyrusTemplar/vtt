The School of Universal Magic</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
As described in the <A HREF="PHB_DD02310.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD02310.htm">Player-s Handbook</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> , the school of divination is actually composed of lesser divinations and
greater divinations. A few specialist mages are barred from greater divination as
an opposition school, but every specialist wizard is considered to have access
to lesser divination. In this book, the school of lesser divination is replaced
by the school of universal magic. This includes a few basic divination and
nondivination spells that all wizards should have access to, such as <I>dispel magic </I>and <I>enchant an item</I>. Any wizard may cast spells of this school, regardless of his or her
specialty.
<P></P>
The divination spells of both the schools of lesser and greater divination are
now considered to be part of one school of divination. Spells such as <I>ESP, clairaudience, </I>and <I>clairvoyance </I>are part of the school of divination and may not be available to wizards who
formerly had access to them as lesser divinations. Refer to <A HREF="DD03717.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03717.htm">Appendix 3</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> for the revised spell organization.
<P></P>
<B>Important Note: </B>Wizards do not automatically know universal spells. They must study and
attempt to learn the spells of this school, just like any other spells. However, when
a wizard character is first created, he automatically begins play with any
1st-level universal spells of his choice in his spell book, although these count
against the character-s limit of beginning spells.

The school of universal magic consists of the following spells:

Most of the low-level spells on this list enable the wizard to undertake his
basic studies in books of arcane lore and safeguard his laboratory and spell
book against intruders. <I>Teleport, teleport without error</I>, and <I>astral spell </I>are included since the ability to travel vast distances in the blink of an eye
is a common power among wizards in fantasy literature. Last but not least, <I>enchant an item </I>and <I>permanency </I>are universal magic because every wizard should have the ability to create
magical items when he or she reaches the appropriate level.
