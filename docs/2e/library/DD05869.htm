The overall wealth of a society will have an important influence on this
relationship. In a poor society, merchants will not be likely to be rich, and they
will not be able to afford any regular thievery. They will not be able to bear
such losses without going bankrupt. Here, merchants will fight tooth and nail to
minimize the depredations of thieves. In richer lands, a little &quot;stock loss&quot;
(among other things) can be tolerated rather better.

Alignment will somewhat modify this. In chaotic and/or evil societies which
are rich, merchants may be very greedy, and may take many measures against
thieves out of a love of money, not out of a need to survive. There may also be an
important element of pride in a society which stresses individualism (chaotic)
rather than one where merchants form groups, ally with each other, and try to
regulate business practices (lawful). Over-proud merchants may resent monies or
goods being stolen not primarily because of the loss of value—it may be
negligible—but because of the loss of face. This can be an important factor in merchants
putting pressure on authorities to suppress thieves, and in their hiring PCs
for sums which exceed the value of their stolen goods!
