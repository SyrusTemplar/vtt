This spell creates the illusion of any object, creature, or force, as long as
it is within the boundaries of the spell's area of effect. The illusion is
visual and affects all believing creatures (undead are immune) that view it. It
does not create sound, smell, or temperature. Effects that depend on these senses
usually fail. The illusion lasts until struck by an opponent--unless the
spellcaster causes the illusion to react appropriately--or until the wizard ceases
concentration upon the spell (due to desire, moving, or a successful attack that
causes damage). Saving throws for illusions are explained under “<A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01650.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01650.htm.php.html">Illusions</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">” in Chapter 7: Magic and under “<A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01807.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01807.htm.php.html">Adjudicating Illusions</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">” at the beginning of Appendix 2. Creatures that disbelieve the illusion see
it for what it is and add +4 to associates' saving throws if this knowledge can
be communicated effectively. Creatures believing the illusion are subject to
its effects (again, as explained in <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01650.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01650.htm.php.html">Chapter 7</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">).

The illusionary effect can be moved by the caster within the limits of the
area of effect. The DM has to rule on the effectiveness of this spell; detailed
guidelines are outlined in <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01650.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01650.htm.php.html">Chapter 7</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">: Magic and under “<A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01807.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01807.htm.php.html">Adjudicating Illusions</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">” at the beginning of Appendix 2.

The material component of the spell is a bit of fleece.
