The deserts prove as inhospitable to most normal plant and animal life as the
arctic regions. However, deserts remain vital to the worldwide order of druids.
<P></P>
Desert druids such as Otaq (pictured on p. 11) are either members of native
nomad tribes or hermits who have moved to the desert to escape civilization.
Valued for their abilities to heal sick animals (and people) and to find or create
pure water, they normally remain on good terms with desert nomads. Although
desert druids revere all the flora and fauna of a desert, from cacti and scorpions
to vultures and camels, they most fiercely protect the few fertile oases,
which house their sacred groves.
<P></P>
Desert druids also may reside in semidesert areas, hot scrub lands, and
chaparral. Unless a DM sets a campaign in actual desert land, this branch best suits
an NPC the party may encounter traveling through the wastes. Many desert druids
live as hermits, not fond of disturbances, and can be short tempered or
downright eccentric. However, no one can top their knowledge of their own desert
area. If a party seeks something in the trackless wastes or finds itself lost,
facing a sandstorm, or running out of food or water, a chance encounter with a
desert druid like Otaq may spell salvation.
