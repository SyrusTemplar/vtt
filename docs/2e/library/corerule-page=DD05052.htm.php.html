From youth, the unbridled curiosity of Natural Philosophers has lent them a
fascination about everything from the characteristics of plants and animals to
the workings of natural forces like lightning and weather, in addition to the
ancient history of the druidic order. Besides the usual ability score
requirements, a druid needs at least Intelligence 15 for this kit.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> Xenia, a typical Natural Philosopher, delights in the study of new plants and
animals. She thinks nothing of venturing into a haunted forest to observe a
rare circle of toadstools or visiting a dragon's den to observe firsthand the
miracle of a hatching. She rarely interferes with her subject of study, preferring
to observe and sketch rather than bring home specimens.
<P></P>
Natural Philosophers often undertake adventures out of sheer curiosity. This
becomes a good role for an NPC druid: Xenia (as either a doddering old sage or a
brash young student) hires a party to accompany her on a dangerous scientific
expedition to visit a living island spotted in a sahuagin-controlled ocean. A
party also might accompany her to study the ecology of the salamander on the
Elemental Plane of Fire or to check out a rumor that a previously extinct species
of giant owl now lives in the woods by a lich's castle.
<P></P>
<B>Branch Restrictions:</B> Arctic and jungle druids cannot take this kit, as their harsh home terrain
forces them to devote their time to mere survival, not scientific pursuits.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Recommended</I>-- staff.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> Hunter, navigator, scribe.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonus</I>-- ancient history. <I>Recommended</I>--(general) artistic ability, languages (modern), weather sense; (priest)
herbalism, languages (ancient), reading/writing; (warrior) animal lore.
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> The druid should spend her initial allotment of gold pieces entirely on
equipment, as she loses any unspent starting money in excess of 1 gp.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> The Natural Philosopher may use weapon proficiency slots for nonweapon
proficiencies. This allows Xenia to devote multiple slots to a single proficiency
(such as animal lore, herbalism, or weather sense), making her an expert in
zoology, botany, or meteorology.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> Remember to reflect in your role-playing the Natural Philosopher's insatiable
curiosity. For instance, Xenia would rather study a new monster than kill it
or run away. She finds puzzles and riddles irresistible and risks even her life
to find the answers.
<P></P>
<B>Wealth Options:</B> 3d6x10 gp.
