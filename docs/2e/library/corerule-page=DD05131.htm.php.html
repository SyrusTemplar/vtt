Here's an option you ought to think about if you're planning to run especially
heroic, combat-heavy adventures or campaigns.
<P></P>
You might wish to start all beginning player-characters out at 3rd experience
level instead of 1st. This makes them a bit tougher, a bit more heroic, and a
lot less fearful about dying with the first blow of their first fight.
<P></P>
However, if you prefer to have your beginning characters a bit more nervous
and defensive, then it's certainly more appropriate for you to start beginning
characters at 1st level.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
At the back of the book is a character sheet especially suited for use with <I>The Complete Fighter's Handbook.</I> Take a look at it, and then we'll discuss it in greater detail.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Front of the Sheet
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
In the top box of the character sheet's front, you put all the vital
statistics of the character: His name, physical and racial characteristics, his
character class, his Warrior Kit (if he uses one—see the<I> Warrior Kits</I> chapter), alignment, current experience level, his current experience earned,
and the amount of experience it'll take him to reach the next level.
<P></P>
In the second box, you put all the information relating to the character's six
ability scores (<A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01425.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01425.htm.php.html">Strength</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01427.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01427.htm.php.html">Dexterity</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01429.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01429.htm.php.html">Constitution</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01431.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01431.htm.php.html">Intelligence</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01433.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01433.htm.php.html">Wisdom</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, and <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01435.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01435.htm.php.html">Charisma</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">). All this information comes from the charts in the <I>Player's Handbook</I>, pages 14-18.
<P></P>
In the third, narrow, box, you write down any bonuses and abilities the
character receives based on his race; for instance, if he's an elf, you'd put
something like &quot;90% resistant to<I> sleep</I> and<I> charm;</I> +1 to attack rolls with bow, short sword, long sword; can surprise opponents;
infravision; 1 on d6 to detect secret doors (1–2 on d6 when looking, 1–3 for
portals).&quot;
<P></P>
In the fourth box, you write down many of the character's game-mechanic notes:
How many hit points he has, how his hit dice are calculated (with Fighters,
you'd write &quot;d10&quot;), what his AC is, what his THAC0 is, what his saving throws
are, notes on his followers and any special abilities or restrictions from his
character class choice (especially appropriate with paladins and rangers), and his
Spell Progression (if any; this, too, is especially appropriate for paladins
and rangers).
<P></P>
In the fifth box, you note down any modifications made to the character by the
Warrior Kit he chooses (again, see the Warrior Kits chapter for details).
<P></P>
In the sixth (bottom) box, you record any of the character's skill-type
abilities: His languages, his weapon proficiencies (and specializations!), and his
nonweapon proficiencies.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Back of the Sheet</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
The back of the sheet is used mostly for equipment lists.
<P></P>
The top box is used to record his weapons; here, you can put all the
information found on the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01624.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01624.htm.php.html">Weapons Table</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> (Player’s Handbook, page 68).
<P></P>
The second box is used for short descriptions of important equipment,
especially magical items.
<P></P>
The third box allows the player to indicate where all his character's
important possessions are normally kept. The DM should insist that the players use
these blanks; it helps prevents mistakes from being made in an adventure. (&quot;Of
course I have my <I>Staff of the Magi</I> along! I always have it taped to my<I> Staff of Power!</I> No, really!&quot;)
<P></P>
And in the bottom box you can make any other notes pertinent to the character.
<P></P>
