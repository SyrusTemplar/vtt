Combat may involve creatures or characters able to attack more than once in a
single round. This may be due to multiple attack forms (claws and bite), skill
with a weapon, or character level. No matter what the reason, all multiple
attacks are handled by one of two methods.
<P></P>
When multiple attacks result from different attack forms--for example claws
and a bite or bite and tail, or a ranger with his two-weapon combat ability--the
attacks occur at the same time. The creature resolves all of its attacks in
initiative order.
<P></P>
When the attacks are true multiples--using the same weapon more than once--as
in the case of a highly skilled fighter, the attacks are staggered. Everyone
involved in the combat completes one action before the second (or subsequent)
attack roll is made.
<P></P>
Take, for example, a fighter who can attack twice per round, and say he's
battling creatures that can only make one attack. The fighter wins initiative. He
makes his first attack according to the rolled initiative order. Then each
creature gets its attack. Finally, the fighter gets his second attack.
<P></P>
If fighters on both sides in a battle were able to attack twice in a round,
their first attacks would occur according to the initiative roll. Their second
attacks would come after all other attacks, and would then alternate according to
the initiative roll.
<P></P>
<P></P>
As an option, a warrior fighting creatures with less than one Hit Die (1-1 or
lower) can make a number of attacks equal to his level (i.e., a 7th-level
fighter can make seven attacks). These attacks are handled in order of initiative.
