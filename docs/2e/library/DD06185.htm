In combat, there are two important advantages a wizard has over the
non-magicusing members of his party:
<P></P>
<P></P>
1. The wizard is an extremely versatile opponent; high-level wizards are
likely to be the most versatile characters in an adventuring party.
<P></P>
<P></P>
2. While the abilities of most other characters tend to confine them to
specific roles, the wizard can adapt his skills to new situations by selecting the
appropriate spells from his spell books (assuming that the wizard has access to a
variety of spells). For instance, a high-level warrior has the same skills
today that he did yesterday.
<P></P>
But a high-level wizard begins each day anew, memorizing a selection of spells
from his spell books that may be radically different from those he memorized
the day before. With the right spells, a wizard can be a master of
reconnaissance one day and an engineer of destruction the next. But if a wizard has a large
selection of spells in his spell books, how does he know which ones will be
most helpful on any particular day? Some wizards, of course, will simply load up
with their most powerful spells and hope for the best. But a shrewd wizard will
look closely at his spells and analyze their primary functions to decide which
are the most appropriate to a particular situation.
