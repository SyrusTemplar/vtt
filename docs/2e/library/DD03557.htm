Describing a Spell</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The first step in creating a new spell is describing its intent and effects.
The interested player should take some time to write up a spell description
similar to the spells in the <A HREF="PHB_DD01655.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01655.htm">Player’s Handbook</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> . Generally, a new spell should be just that—new. Spells that do the same
thing as existing spells or a combination of existing spells aren’t really new,
and need a better “hook” for purposes of spell research. Here are some
guidelines, by category:
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Level: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Naturally, the character should be able to cast the spell he’s trying to
develop, so the spell in question must be at or under his normal maximum spell
level. For example, a 6th-level wizard can use spells of 3rd-level or less, so he
can research 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spells.
<P></P>
Compare the proposed spell to a similar spell to get an idea of what a fair
level assignment should be. Generally, spells should inflict about one die of
damage per level, give or take a die; compare the spell’s potential to <I>magic missile, fireball</I>, or <I>flame arrow</I>. Spells that do not allow saving throws, or spells that can affect an
opponent regardless of his level or Hit Dice, are often of higher level than similar
spells. Spells that are improvements of existing spells should be one to three
levels higher than the spell they’re modelled on, depending on the extent of the
improvement.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>School/Sphere: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Refer to <A HREF="DD03378.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03378.htm">Chapter 1</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> and <A HREF="DD03419.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03419.htm">Chapter 2</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> ; brief descriptions of each school of wizard magic and each sphere of priest
magic appear in those chapters. Both wizards and priests may only conduct
research in schools or spheres they have access to, so a cleric may not research
new animal or plant spells, and an invoker may not research illusion spells.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Range: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Damage-inflicting attack spells should have a good justification for ranges
greater than 150 yards (or more than 10 yards per caster level), while
nondamaging attack spells (<I>sleep, hold, polymorph, </I>and other such effects) rarely exceed more than 100 yards (or more than five
yards per caster level) in range. Other spells can vary wildly in range,
depending on their function; communication or transportation spells may allow a range
of hundreds of miles.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Duration: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">While damage from attack spells or the effects of many noncombat spells are
permanent, most spells that create a condition or change of status for their
subjects have a well-defined duration. Durations can be defined by time (the
preferred method) or until a certain predefined event occurs. For example, <I>invisibility </I>lasts until the caster makes an attack, while a <I>charm </I>can last for a few days or for several months, depending on the victim. Very
few low-level spells should bring about a permanent change or weakness in a
living target.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Area of Effect: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A spell that can affect several people at once, or several dozen people at
once, is inherently more powerful than a spell that affects a single individual.
Spells designed to affect several enemies can affect a random number of subjects
in a cube of about 20 to 30 feet (for example, <I>hold person </I>affects 1 to 4 targets in a 20-foot cube). Spells designed to affect more than
10 or 12 individuals shouldn’t be larger than a <I>fireball</I>, which affects a sphere of 20 feet in radius. Exceeding these limits requires
a more powerful (and therefore higher-level) spell than one that stays well
within them.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Components: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Most spells should have all three components—verbal, material, and
somatic—unless there’s a good reason for omitting one. Spells with only one component are
fairly rare. Note that spells without verbal components can be cast even if the
character is <I>silenced</I>, and are therefore more dangerous than they may appear to be at first look.
<P></P>
Material components that are hard to come by or very expensive can be used to
control a spell’s use in a campaign. Even though a 1st-level wizard can use <I>identify</I>, each time he does so, he must ruin a 100 gp pearl. If the DM enforces
material component rules, the wizard might think twice before casting the spell any
time he feels like it.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Casting Time: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The rule of thumb for wizard spells is a casting time of 1 per level, so a
4th-level spell (for instance) should have a casting time of 4. Priest spells
default to a casting time of 3 plus 1 per level, so a 4th-level priest spell should
be around a 7. If a spell is significantly under this mark, it should either
be weaker than spells of a similar level, or higher in level than normal.
Conversely, a prolonged casting time may help to compensate for other advantages.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Saving Throw: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">While the nature of the saving throw varies with the purpose of the spell,
enchantments that incapacitate the victim without the benefit of a saving throw
should be rare or limited to a type of victim affected. The <I>sleep </I>spell is a good example; it allows no saving throw, but can only affect
low-Hit Dice creatures. Damage-causing spells that affect more than a single target
without a saving throw are uncommon and tend to be high in level.
<P></P>
<A NAME="5ff7b0e1"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Description and Effects: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">When creating the actual description of the spell, remember to note who it
affects, how it works, what it does, and how it can be stopped or undone. If the
duration, range, or saving throw is described as ‘special,’ make sure you note
how it is special and what its limits actually are.
<P></P>
Most spells should perform one specific action, although spells may present
several applications from which one can be selected when the spell is cast (see <A HREF="PHB_DD02041.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD02041.htm">Otiluke’s freezing sphere</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>for an example of this). Spells that actually do two or three things at once,
such as <I>shadow door </I>or <I>guards and wards</I>, are quite rare and are almost always high-level enchantments.
<P></P>
Last but not least, creating a new spell is an opportunity to be creative—feel
free to add any color or special effects that are appropriate. A spell that
makes a character impervious to cold is useful, but not very colorful; however, a
spell that transforms a character’s blood to magical ice water, thereby
enabling him to resist cold damage, is a little more interesting. Also consider side
effects or dangerous combinations of powers when writing up the spell
description.
