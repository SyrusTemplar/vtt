Any closeable item (book, box, bottle, chest, coffer, coffin, door, drawer,
and so forth) can be warded by a <I>fire trap</I> spell. The spell is centered on a point selected by the spellcaster. The item
so trapped cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed upon it (if
such is attempted, the chance is 25% that the first spell fails, 25% that the
second spell fails, or 50% that both spells fail). A <I>knock</I> spell does not affect a fire trap in any way--as soon as the offending party
enters or touches the item, the trap discharges. Thieves and others have only
half their normal chance to detect a fire trap (by noticing the characteristic
markings required to cast the spell). They have only half their normal chance to
remove the trap (failure detonates the trap immediately). An unsuccessful
dispel does not detonate the spell. The caster can use the trapped object without
discharging it, as can any individual to whom the spell was specifically attuned
when cast (the exact method usually involves a keyword). When the trap is
discharged, there is an explosion of 5-foot radius from the spell's center; all
creatures within this area must roll saving throws vs. spell. Damage is 1d4 points
plus 1 point per level of the caster, or half this (round up) for creatures
successfully saving. (Under water, this ward inflicts half damage and creates a
large cloud of steam.) The item trapped is not harmed by this explosion.

To place this spell, the caster must trace the outline of the closure with a
bit of sulphur or saltpeter and touch the center of the effect. Attunement to
another individual requires a hair or similar object from that person.
