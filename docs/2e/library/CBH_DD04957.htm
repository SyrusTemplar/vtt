<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Specialty:</B> Juggler/Acrobat.
<P></P>
<B>Qualifications:</B> Jongleurs must have a Dexterity of 14 or more (other ability scores,
standard). Gnomes can advance to the 9th level as Jongleurs. Halflings can attain 12th
level.
<P></P>
<B>Introduction:</B> <I>Yes, I am a Jongleur. My stage name is Jonclaur the Jongleur, and that will do
for now. I travel across the Flanaess with a small carnival band. I believe
you have already met one of my companions, Dark. He's good with knives and
swords, but his personality matches his name a little too much for me.
<P></P>
When our troupe puts on a show, I tend to draw the largest and most consistent
audience. In particular, families and village thieves enjoy watching my act.
Families watch because my juggling, pole vaulting, acrobatics, and tightrope
walking amazes them (and occasionally fills them with concern when my act looks
particularly hazardous). The thieves come to study my actions. Many thieves can
pole vault, walk tightropes, and perform various feats of acrobatics, but none
have my skill. In a way, it's a form of research for them.
<P></P>
And it is true, though I hate to admit it, that my talents are occasionally
put to less-than-honorable uses. On one of the last few days of our show, a large
part of our troupe often stages some complex burglary. My skills are often
invaluable. I can vault across moats or into upper story windows that are
protected by walls coated with contact poison. If a mansion is guarded by dogs, I use a
crossbow to fire a line from a nearby building, then walk across it. Of
course, I rarely keep my share of this booty. Instead, I usually donate it to the
local orphanage or poorhouse.
<P></P>
Well, nice chatting with you, but I must get back. My second act is about to
begin.</I>
<P></P>
<B>Description: </B>Jongleurs are loosely based upon the French entertainers of the same name.
They are masters at manipulating small items with their hands. They can catch and
juggle almost anything. On top of this they are skilled acrobats, able to
traverse tightropes, turn flips, polevault, and perform any number of acrobatic
feats. Their agility provides them with great defensive resources.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> As entertainers, most Jongleurs are typically found accompanying carnivals or
circuses. A troupe of Jongleurs can put on a remarkable show all by
themselves. They often perform in taverns or clubs, using their arts to draw in the crowd
and captivate them long enough for the barkeeper (as well as the Jongleurs) to
drain the crowd's purses. Of course, a few free-lancers work the streets out
of greed or need.
<P></P>
Jongleurs are useful adventuring allies; their skills are invaluable when the
going gets tough. They are able to squeeze into places where nobody else can go
without the aid of magic. Finally, their skill at avoiding certain traps makes
them excellent scouts.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> Any.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Jongleurs can use all hurled weapons. A hurled weapon is any weapon that can
be thrown (this does not include bows, blowguns, or other missile weapons that
are fired or shot). Otherwise, Jongleurs are restricted to the following
weapons: polearms, quarterstaff, sling, staff sling, and whip. All of these weapons
can be used in their performances. For example, they can juggle daggers, pole
vault with polearms, and balance with spears or quarterstaves.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies: </B><I>Bonuses:</I> Juggling, Jumping, Tightrope Walking, Tumbling. <I>Suggested:</I> Direction Sense, Endurance, Poetry, Rope Use, Running.
<P></P>
<B>Armor/Equipment:</B> If a Jongleur wears any type of armor other than leather, studded leather,
padded, or elven chain mail, he cannot use any of the following special benefits.
All other forms of armor are simply too restrictive or bulky for the Jongleur
to properly perform.
<P></P>
Jongleurs tend to dress in rather flashy colors. However, they don't take this
to the extremes that Jesters do. They avoid large capes, robes, and other
garments that can catch or tangle during movement. Of course, this does not mean
that a Jongleur is going to wear a flaming red suit that sparkles in the dimmest
of lights when exploring ancient ruins. They prefer flash and fanfare, but they
aren't stupid.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B>
<P></P>
<I>Extended Proficiencies:</I> Because Jongleurs are extremely skilled at all forms of juggling and
acrobatics, they gain certain special benefits to their bonus proficiencies.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Juggling:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The Jongleur adds his level to the attack roll when trying to catch small
items.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Missile or hurled weapons too large to catch can be deflected by using the
juggling proficiency.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Jumping:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The Jongleur doubles his level for all jumping calculations.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The character can use poles up to 20 feet longer than himself.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Vaults can be made with a 15-foot run. The pole need not be dropped if a
second proficiency check is successful.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Tightrope Walking:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> All penalties are halved, dropping fractions (<I>i.e</I>., -5 for one-inch surfaces, -2 for two- to six-inch surfaces, and -2 attack
roll penalty).
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Use of a balancing rod provides a +4 bonus.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Tumbling:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The +4 Armor Class bonus applies during any round in which initiative is won,
even if the Jongleur opts to attack later that round.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> No proficiency check is required to reduce falling damage. However, a
successful proficiency check doubles the falling distances (<I>i.e</I>., no damage up to 20 feet and only half damage up to 120 feet).
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Dodge:</I> Jongleurs are amazingly agile and have very quick reflexes. This enables them
to jump free of many potentially harmful situations if a successful saving
throw vs. paralyzation is rolled. The only bonus allowed to the save is the
defensive bonus for high Dexterity.
<P></P>
If the attempted dodge fails, the Jongleur suffers the full effects of the
danger. No other saving throw can be rolled to avoid the threat, as the dodge
takes the place of all other saving throws. The benefit of dodging is that all harm
is completely avoided, whereas many successful saving throws result in half
damage. Of course, the Jongleur player can opt to skip the dodge attempt in favor
of any normally allowed saving throws.
<P></P>
Dodging does not affect missile weapons or hurled weapons, personal spells
(those that affect only one person) directed specifically at the Jongleur, or
spells that have no physical effect to dodge (such as <I>hold person</I> ).
<P></P>
Situations that can be avoided include falls (into pits, through illusionary
floors, down sliding stairways traps, etc.), being struck from above (by ceiling
blocks, rocks, piercers, collapses, <I>etc</I>.), area-effect spells that can be dodged (<I>lightning bolt, web, fireball, etc</I>.), and any other situation that the Dungeon Master feels could be avoided by
a sudden agile leap (possibly breath weapons). Of course, if a jump to safety
is impossible, the Jongleur cannot attempt a dodge. Note that Jongleurs are also
able to climb walls and might avoid certain situations by clinging to a wall.
<P></P>
<I>Entertain Crowd:</I> By juggling, performing flips, or displaying his acrobatic talents, a
Jongleur can influence the reactions of an audience. This ability is similar to the
True Bard's influence reactions ability.
<P></P>
As with that ability, the crowd cannot be attacking or about to attack. The
Jongleur must perform for 1d10 rounds, after which all non-player characters
viewing the performance must roll saving throws vs. paralyzation (split large
audiences into groups of 10 and roll one saving throw for each group). The saving
throw is rolled with a -1 penalty per three levels of the bard (round down).
Those failing have their reactions adjusted one level in a more friendly direction,
as per <A HREF="DMG_DD00564.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00564.htm">Table 59</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> in the <I>DMG</I> .
<P></P>
Unlike True Bards, Jongleurs cannot attempt to worsen the reactions of a crowd
(it is very difficult to juggle or walk a tightrope in an offensive manner).
However, if the crowd saves with a natural 1, the onlookers disapprove of the
Jongleur and their reactions actually worsen by one level.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> Jongleurs do not gain the 10th-level ability to use any written magical item.
