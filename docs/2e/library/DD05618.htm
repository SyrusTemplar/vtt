This character tries to fit each of his adventures and encounters into the
grand scheme of the meaning of life. He's not a very exciting personality, being
more thoughtful and reserved than the dynamic Motivator or energetic Earnest
Novice. He often adopts a &quot;Let's wait and see what happens&quot; or &quot;Maybe it was meant
to be&quot; attitude. He seldom initiates combat or aggression, but this doesn't
make him a pacifist; once he gets into combat, he can be as formidable an
opponent as any priest of his class.
<P></P>
The Philosopher is best suited to lawful and neutral alignments (lawful good,
lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral good, true neutral, neutral evil).
<P></P>
In combat situations, the Philosopher will often hang back for a round or so
to gauge the situation and analyze things. In doing so, he may see something the
other characters have missed (more enemies creeping out of a secret panel, an
exit tunnel that would allow them to escape, or the stealthy motions of an
enemy thief creeping around behind one of the heroes). But he won't hesitate long,
particularly when it could mean life or death to his friends.
<P></P>
In role-playing situations, he tends to be very analytical, choosing his words
carefully, thinking all the while.
