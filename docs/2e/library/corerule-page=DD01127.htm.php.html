<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sword of Wounding:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This is a sword of only +1 bonus, but any hit made with it cannot be healed by <I>regeneration.</I> In subsequent rounds, the opponent so wounded loses one additional hit point
for each wound inflicted by the sword.
<P></P>
Thus, an opponent hit for four points of damage on the first melee round will
automatically lose one additional hit point on the second and each successive
round of combat. Loss of the extra point stops only when the creature so wounded
bandages its wound or after 10 melee rounds (one turn).
<P></P>
Damage from a <I>sword of wounding</I> can be healed only by normal means (rest and time), never by potion, spell,
or other magical means short of a <I>wish.</I> Note that successive wounds will damage in the same manner as the first.
