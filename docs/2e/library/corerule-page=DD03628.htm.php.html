<FONT SIZE="3">Once employed by the mysterious ancient wizard known
as the Arcanamach, the mage Sirellyn rediscovered this forgotten
dweomer many centuries after its last use. The spell causes a number
of shining metal bands to materialize out of the air, encircling and
capturing a target of the caster&#146;s choice. The victim is allowed
a saving throw vs. spell to elude capture, with a &#150;1 penalty per
three caster levels (for example, &#150;1 for a 4th to 6th level
caster, &#150;2 for a 7th to 9th level caster, &#150;3 for a 10th to
12th level caster, and so on), since higher-level casters tend to
conjure more bands in a denser pattern. Any creature of less than
size G (gargantuan) can be snared, but gargantuan monsters are simply
too big to be restrained by the bands.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">If the victim fails his saving throw vs. spell, he is
caught and held immobile by the bands. He may not move his arms and
legs, but he is still capable of speech and can employ psionic powers
or use worn magical items, such as rings. Subjects with a Strength
rating may attempt to burst the bands and free themselves with a bend
bars/lift gates roll. If the subject does not have a strength rating,
it may make a saving throw vs. petrification with a &#150;4 penalty.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The spell requires three miniature bands of silver
that are interlocked so that all three are connected.</FONT></P>
