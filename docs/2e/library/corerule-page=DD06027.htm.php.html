A character with locksmith proficiency can try to build a superior lock, but
only if the proper materials are available. In most cases this means an iron or
steel lock, though special considerations can be adjudicated by the DM. The
locksmith must make a proficiency check for the lock. A roll of 1 or less
indicates a lock of superior craftsmanship. Subtract 1 from the die roll for every
proficiency slot <I>beyond the first</I> spent on the locksmith skill. For example, a craftsman with three slots of
locksmith skill creates a superior lock on a roll of 1, 2, or 3.
<P></P>
The modification for such a specific lock is determined by rolling 1d10,
resulting in a 1-10% modifier. Each improved lock will be at least as good as the
one before it, however, so re-roll results that are lower than the modifier for a
previous lock made by that same smith. When the locksmith makes locks with a
10% modifier, he is allowed to roll 2d10. When he reaches 20%, he receives 3d10,
but is no longer guaranteed to beat his previous high roll. He does get to
roll 3d10 until he gets a result of 20 or greater, however.
<P></P>
For example, a locksmith builds a superior lock and rolls a 7% modifier. On
his next superior lock, he rolls and discards a 6, 3, and 5, before rolling a 10.
He keeps the 10, since that is the first roll to equal or beat his previous
high of 7. On his next superior lock, he rolls 2d10, using the first adjusted
roll of 10 or higher. If he eventually gets a 20, he rolls 3d10 until he gets a
result of 20 or greater. All his subsequent superior locks, then, will gain at
least 20% modifiers, with the occasional one perhaps as high as 30%.
