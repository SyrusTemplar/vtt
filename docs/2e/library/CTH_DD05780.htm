A character with this proficiency is capable of imitating noises made by
various animals. A successful proficiency check means that only magic can
distinguish the noise from that of the actual animal being imitated. A failed die roll
means that the sound varies from the correct noise in some slight way.
<P></P>
If the die roll fails, this does not mean that all creatures hearing the noise
know that the sound is fake. While creatures and humanoids that are very
familiar with the noise know this automatically, other creatures or characters in
earshot may require Wisdom checks to determine if they detect the fake.
<P></P>
Bandits and Smugglers often use this ability for communication on the job,
almost as a variant dialect of thieves' cant.
