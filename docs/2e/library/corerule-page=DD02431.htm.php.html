Moving allows a character to cover a lot of ground without dropping his
defenses. Moving is normally a full-move action, but if a character only moves half
his maximum move or less, he can consider it a half-move action instead.
<P></P>
Movement normally begins on a characterâ€™s base initiative, without modifiers
for weapon speed. Each half-move a character makes requires one phase, so a fast
character does half his move in the fast phase and finishes his move in the
average phase.
