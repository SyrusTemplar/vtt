</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Rather than slug it out toe to toe with an opponent, a character can move up
to one-half his normal movement rate and engage in missile fire at half his
normal rate of fire. Thus, a man capable of moving 120 feet and armed with a long
bow (two shots per round, under normal circumstances) could move 60 feet and
still fire one shot. The same man, armed with a heavy crossbow (one shot every
other round) would be able to shoot only once every four rounds while on the move.
