<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>An Example of Play
<P></P>
</B>To further clarify what really goes on during an AD&amp;D game, read the following
example. This is typical of the sort of action that occurs during a playing
session.
<P></P>
Shortly before this example begins, three player characters fought a skirmish
with a wererat (a creature similar to a werewolf but which becomes an enormous
rat instead of a wolf). The wererat was wounded and fled down a tunnel. The
characters are in pursuit. The group includes two fighters and a cleric. Fighter 1
is the group's leader.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B> </B>You've been following this tunnel for about 120 yards. The water on the floor
is ankle deep and very cold. Now and then you feel something brush against your
foot. The smell of decay is getting stronger. The tunnel is gradually filling
with a cold mist.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fighter 1:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B> </B>I don't like this at all. Can we see anything up ahead that looks like a
doorway, or a branch in the tunnel?
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B> </B>Within the range of your torchlight, the tunnel is more or less straight. You
don't see any branches or doorways.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cleric: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The wererat we hit had to come this way. There's nowhere else to go.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fighter 1: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Unless we missed a hidden door along the way. I hate this place; it gives me
the creeps.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fighter 2: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">We have to track down that wererat. I say we keep going.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fighter 1: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">OK. We keep moving down the tunnel. But keep your eyes open for anything that
might be a door.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Another 30 or 35 yards down the tunnel, you find a stone block on the floor.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fighter 1: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A block? I take a closer look.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">It's a cut block, about 12 by 16 inches, and 18 inches or so high. It looks
like a different kind of rock than the rest of the tunnel.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fighter 2: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Where is it? Is it in the center of the tunnel or off to the side?
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">It's right up against the side.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fighter 1: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Can I move it?
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">(checking the character's Strength score): Yeah, you can push it around
without too much trouble.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fighter 1: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Hmmm. This is obviously a marker of some sort. I want to check this area for
secret doors. Spread out and examine the walls.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> (rolls several dice behind his rule book, where players can't see the
results): Nobody finds anything unusual along the walls.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fighter 1: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">It has to be here somewhere. What about the ceiling?
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">You can't reach the ceiling. It's about a foot beyond your reach.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cleric: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Of course! That block isn't a marker, it's a step. I climb up on the block and
start prodding the ceiling.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> (rolling a few more dice): You poke around for 20 seconds or so, then
suddenly part of the tunnel roof shifts. You've found a panel that lifts away.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fighter 1: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Open it very carefully.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cleric: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">I pop it up a few inches and push it aside slowly. Can I see anything?
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Your head is still below the level of the opening, but you see some dim light
from one side.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fighter 1: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">We boost him up so he can get a better look.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">OK, your friends boost you up into the room...
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fighter 1: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">No, no! We boost him just high enough to get his head through the opening.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">OK, you boost him up a foot. The two of you are each holding one of his legs.
Cleric, you see another tunnel, pretty much like the one you were in, but it
only goes off in one direction. Thee's a doorway about 10 yards away with a soft
light inside. A line of muddy pawprints leads from the hole you're in to the
doorway.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cleric: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Fine. I want the fighters to go first.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As they're lowering you back to the block, everyone hears some grunts,
splashing, and clanking weapons coming from further down the lower tunnel. They seem
to be closing fast.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cleric: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Up! Up! Push me back up through the hole! I grab the ledge and haul myself up.
I'll help pull the next guy up.
<P></P>
(All three characters scramble up through the hole.)
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">What about the panel?
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fighter 1: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">We push it back into place.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">It slides back into its slot with a nice, loud “clunk.” The grunting from
below gets a lot louder.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fighter 1: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Great, they heard it. Cleric, get over here and stand on this panel. We're
going to check out that doorway.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Cleric, you hear some shouting and shuffling around below you, then there's a
thump and the panel you're standing on lurches.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cleric: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">They're trying to batter it open!
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B> </B>(to the fighters): When you peer around the doorway, you see a small, dirty
room with a small cot, a table, and a couple of stools. On the cot is a wererat
curled up into a ball. Its back is toward you. There's another door in the far
wall and a small gong in the corner.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fighter 1: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Is the wererat moving?
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Not a bit. Cleric, the panel just thumped again. You can see a little crack in
it now.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cleric: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Do something quick, you guys. When this panel starts coming apart, I'm getting
off it.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fighter 1: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">OK already! I step into the room and prod the wererat with my shield. What
happens?
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Nothing. You see blood on the cot.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fighter 1: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Is this the same wererat we fought before?
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Who knows? All wererats look the same to you. Cleric, the panel thumps again.
That crack is looking really big.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cleric: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">That's it. I get off the panel, I'm moving into the room with everybody else.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There's a tremendous smash and you hear chunks of rock banging around out in
the corridor, followed by lots of snarling and squeaking. You see flashes of
torchlight and wererat shadows through the doorway.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fighter 1: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">All right, the other fighter and I move up to block the doorway. That's the
narrowest area, they can only come through it one or two at a time. Cleric, you
stay in the room and be ready with your spells.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fighter 2: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">At last, a decent, stand-up fight!
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As the first wererat appears in the doorway with a spear in his paws, you hear
a slam behind you.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cleric: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">I spin around. What is it?
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The door in the back of the room is broken off its hinges. Standing in the
doorway, holding a mace in each paw, is the biggest, ugliest wererat you've ever
seen. A couple more pairs of red eyes are shining through the darkness behind
him. He's licking his chops in a way that you find very unsettling.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cleric: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Aaaaarrrgh! I scream the name of my deity at the top of my lungs and then flip
over the cot with the dead wererat on it so the body lands in front of him.
I've got to have some help here, guys.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fighter 1 </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">(to fighter 2): Help him, I'll handle this end of the room. (To DM:) I'm
attacking the wererat in the first doorway.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>DM: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">While fighter 2 is switching positions, the big wererat looks at the body on
the floor and his jaw drops. He looks back up and says, “That's Ignatz. He was
my brother. You killed my brother.” Then he raises both maces and leaps at you.
<P></P>
<P></P>
At this point a ferocious melee breaks out. The DM uses the combat rules to
play out the battle. If the characters survive, they can continue on whatever
course they choose.
