A mounted enemy can be knocked off his steed by a number of methods. Whenever
a character is in danger of falling off his horse, he must roll a successful
riding proficiency check (or a saving throw vs. paralyzation if he doesn?t have
the riding proficiency) to remain in the saddle. If he fails, he?s considered to
be knocked down and is lying prone on the ground.
