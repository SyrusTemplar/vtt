Upon completion of this spell, the wizard raps his staff on the ground and
produces a thundering cone of force 5' wide at the apex, 20' wide at the base, and
40' long. All creatures wholly or partially within this cone must roll a
successful saving throw or be stunned for 1d3 rounds. Stunned creatures are unable
to think coherently or act during this time and are deafened for 1d3+1 rounds.
Additionally, those who fail the save are hurled 4d4+4 feet by the wave of
force, suffering 1 point of damage per two feet thrown. Intervening surfaces (walls,
doors, etc.) may restrict this distance, but damage remains the same (4d4+4).
<P></P>
If the save is successful, the victim is not stunned, but is deafened for
1d3+1 rounds and is hurled only half the distance.
<P></P>
Giant-sized or larger creatures who succeed at their saving throws are
deafened but are not thrown, suffer no loss of hit points, and are not stunned. If the
saving throw is failed, such creatures are hurled 2d4+2 feet, suffer one point
of damage per two feet thrown, and are deafened and stunned.
<P></P>
The cone of force is considered to have a Strength of 19 for purposes of
opening locked, barred, or magically held doors. This spell can move objects
weighing up to 640 pounds a maximum distance of 4d4+4 feet. Fragile items must make a
saving throw vs. crushing blow or be destroyed.
<P></P>
The material components are a vial of rain gathered during a thunderstorm and
the wizard's staff, which must be made of oak. The staff is not destroyed
during casting.
