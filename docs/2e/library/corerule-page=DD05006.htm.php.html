The following are a few sample songs to whet your appetite. If you would like
to write your own songs for your bard to sing, it is suggested that you get a
book of old, traditional folk songs, and replace existing words with those of
your own choosing.

<B>Bonnie George Campbell (Scottish ballad)</B>
<P></P>
<P></P>
1. Hie upon Hielands, and laigh upon Tay,
<P></P>
Bonnie George Campbell rode out on a day.
<P></P>
He saddled, he bridled, and gallant rode he,
<P></P>
And hame cam his guid horse, but never cam he.
<P></P>
<P></P>
2. Out cam his mother, dear, greeting fu sair,
<P></P>
And out cam his bonnie bryde, riving her hair.
<P></P>
The meadow lies green, the corn is unshorn,
<P></P>
But bonnie George Campbell will never return.
<P></P>
<P></P>
3. Saddled and bridled and booted rode he,
<P></P>
A plume in his helmet, a sword at his knee.
<P></P>
But toom cam his saddle, all bloody to see,
<P></P>
Oh, hame cam his guid horse, but never cam he!
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>My Gentle Harp (Irish love song)</B>
<P></P>
<P></P>
1. My gentle harp, once more I waken
<P></P>
the sweetness of thy slumb'ring strain,
<P></P>
In tears our last farewell was taken,
<P></P>
And now in tears we meet again.
<P></P>
Yet even then while peace was singing
<P></P>
Her halcyon song o'er land and sea,
<P></P>
Though joy and hope to others bringing,
<P></P>
She only brought new tears to thee.
<P></P>
<P></P>
2. Then who can ask for notes of pleasure,
<P></P>
My drooping harp, from chords like thine?
<P></P>
Alas, the lark's gay morning measure
<P></P>
As ill would suit the swan's decline.
<P></P>
Or how shall I, who love, who bless thee,
<P></P>
Invoke thy breath for freedom's strains,
<P></P>
When e'en the wreaths in which I dress thee,
<P></P>
Are sadly mixed, half flowers, half chains?
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Skye Boat Song (Scottish ballad)</B>
<P></P>
<P></P>
1. Loud the winds howl, loud the waves roar
<P></P>
Thunder clouds rend the air;
<P></P>
Baffled our foe's stand on the shore,
<P></P>
Follow they will not dare.
<P></P>
<P></P>
2. Though the waves leap, soft shall ye sleep,
<P></P>
Ocean's a royal bed;
<P></P>
Rock'd in the deep, Flora will keep
<P></P>
watch by your weary head.
<P></P>
<P></P>
3.Many's the lad fought on that day,
<P></P>
Well the claymore could wield
<P></P>
When the night came, silently lay
<P></P>
Dead on Culloden's field.
<P></P>
<P></P>
4. Burn'd our homes, exile and death
<P></P>
Scatter the loyal men;
<P></P>
Yet, e'er the sword cool in the sheath,
<P></P>
Charlie will come again.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Chorus:</I>
<P></P>
Speed, bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing,
<P></P>
&quot;Onward!&quot; the sailors cry.
<P></P>
&quot;Carry the lad that's born to be king
<P></P>
Over the sea to Skye!&quot;
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>The Minstrel Boy (Irish song of valor)
<P></P>
</B>
<P></P>
1. The minstrel boy to the war is gone,
<P></P>
In the ranks of death you'll find him;
<P></P>
His father's sword he has girded on,
<P></P>
And his wild harp slung behind him.
<P></P>
&quot;Land of song!&quot; said the warrior bard,
<P></P>
&quot;Though all the world betrays thee,
<P></P>
One sword, at least, thy rights shall guard,
<P></P>
One faithful harp shall praise thee.&quot;
<P></P>
<P></P>
2. The minstrel fell, but the foeman's chain
<P></P>
Could not bring that proud soul under;
<P></P>
The harp he lov'd ne'er spoke again,
<P></P>
For he tore its chords a sunder;
<P></P>
And said, &quot;No chain shall sully thee,
<P></P>
Thou soul of love and bravery
<P></P>
Thy songs were made for the pure and free,
<P></P>
They shall never sound in slavery.&quot;
<P></P>
