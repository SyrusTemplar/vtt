made from rare and fantastic metals. Different metals have different properties
which must be taken into account when such armors are used. <A HREF="DD00327.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00327.htm">Table 27</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> lists several different types of metals and the effects they have on Armor
