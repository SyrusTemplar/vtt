There are six different defenses that a dueling character can choose from when
building his attack pattern for the round. The defenses are:
<P></P>
<P></P>
1 <B>None: </B>The character chooses to use a standard defense, not utilizing any unusual
<P></P>
maneuvers.
<P></P>
2 <B>Weapon Block: </B>The character allocates an attack for the block maneuver, using a
<P></P>
weapon to catch one of his opponent's attacks.
<P></P>
3 <B>Defensive Trap: </B>The character allocates an attack to perform the trap maneuver.
<P></P>
The trap itself can be performed with a primary or secondary weapon or even a
<P></P>
shield.
<P></P>
4 <B>Defensive Disarm: </B>The character allocates an attack to perform a defensive
<P></P>
disarm.
<P></P>
5 <B>Shield Block: </B>The character allocates an attack for the block maneuver, using a
<P></P>
shield to catch one of his opponent's attacks.
<P></P>
6 <B>Parry: </B>The character chooses the combat action parry, making no attacks this
<P></P>
round. Parrying provides the character with a bonus to his AC equal to 1/2 his
<P></P>
level, or 1/2 his level plus one if he is a warrior.
