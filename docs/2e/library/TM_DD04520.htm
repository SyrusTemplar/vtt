<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Tome of Mystical Equations:</B> This book is indistinguishable from other magical tomes. It contains charts
and equations relating to several of the spells belonging to the sphere of
Numbers. It can be used as the material component for the spells<I> personal reading, telethaumaturgy,</I> and <I>addition</I>. If it is used in this manner, the casting time for the spell is halved, and
any saving throw that the subject of the spell might be entitled to suffers a
-2 penalty.
