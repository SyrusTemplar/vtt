Only a Fighting-Monk can specialize in more than one unarmed combat style. A
Fighting-Monk can only specialize in one of the three unarmed combat styles when
he is first created. After first level, however, he may specialize in the
other two.
<P></P>
As described in the writeup of the Fighting-Monk kit, the character can save
some of his Weapon Proficiencies.
<P></P>
For example, at first level, he could specialize in Martial Arts, then spend
another slot at second level to specialize in Wrestling, then another at third
level to specialize in Punching.
<P></P>
However, if he first specializes in Punching or Wrestling, he cannot
specialize in Martial Arts at the next experience level. He can only spend one slot per
experience level, meaning that he'll first gain proficiency with Martial Arts
at one level, then specialize at the next level.
<P></P>
Usually, the character, if he wants to specialize in more than one style, will
take either Martial Arts or Punching, not both, and then take Wrestling.
Martial Arts and Punching overlap one another somewhat, but Wrestling is useful when
the character is being held.
