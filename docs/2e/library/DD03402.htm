</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Dimensionalist:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This uncommon specialist is a student of magic that relies on the
manipulation of space, time, and dimension. The dimensionalist is familiar with all kinds
of extradimensional pockets, planes, and sources of power. While other wizards
can make use of these dimensions, the dimensionalist has a much clearer
understanding of what he is doing and why when he casts spells of this school.
Non-Euclidean geometry and planar relationships are difficult material, even for a
wizard; a character must have an Intelligence (Intelligence/Reason in the <A HREF="SP_DD02873.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="SP_DD02873.htm">Skills &amp; Powers</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>rules) of 16 or better to grasp the more esoteric concepts required to master
this kind of magic.

The school of dimensional magic is listed in <A HREF="DD03717.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03717.htm">Appendix 3</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> of this book. It includes spells such as <I>rope trick, dimension door, distance distortion, </I>and <I>maze</I>. Dimensional magic is opposed by the schools of enchantment/charm and
necromancy, since these philosophies have nothing to do with extraplanar studies or
spells.

dimension, he is detectable only by spells that can discern dimensional openings and is
immune to any attack, but he also has no way of knowing what?s happening in
the place he left until he chooses to step back into the real world. The
dimensionalist may remain for up to one hour before he is forced to exit and can take
any actions he desires (sleeping, reading, drinking a potion, or so on) while
inside. Note that the pocket dimension?s point of exit is always the exact same
place the dimensionalist entered the dimension. Also, no spells that would allow
the dimensionalist to leave the pocket without first reentering the real world
can function in the extradimensional place, including <I>teleport, dimension door, shadow walk, </I>and similar enchantments. At 11th level, the dimensionalist may bring one
other human-sized creature or an object weighing less than 500 pounds with him; at
14th level, he may bring up to five companions or an object weighing 1,500
pounds.

The dimensionalist is a very unusual wizard, with access to some of the
strangest spells in the game. A high-level dimensionalist can be a confounding
opponent, calling on rarely seen powers to trap or misdirect his enemies.
Dimensionalists have few attack spells, but excel in avoiding trouble or circumventing
obstacles.
