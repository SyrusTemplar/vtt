This spell only affects skeletons and zombies, which temporarily gain the
speed and agility of a living human in a peak, healthy state (a movement rate of
12). The undead also gain the same dexterity, initiative, and saving throws as
the caster (providing, of course, that these attributes are better than those of
the undead). Because of their alacrity, the armor class of the undead is
automatically improved by 1 (and possibly further modified by the defense adjustment
of the caster, if any). The material components are three drops of water, sinew
of any mammal, and a drop of quicksilver.
