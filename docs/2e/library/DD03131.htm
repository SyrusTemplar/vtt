<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Phobia-Enclosed Spaces:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This has effects similar to the darkness phobia, though of course the
presence of light is immaterial-this phobia can strike in a lighted room or in a
narrow, winding tunnel. In general, when the ceiling is no more than two feet
overhead, and the walls are within two feet of the character's outstretched hands,
he-ll have trouble. As with the fear of darkness, the character must check
Wisdom/Willpower before entering an enclosed area.
