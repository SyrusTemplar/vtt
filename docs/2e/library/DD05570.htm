<P></P>
This deity is related to the gods of agriculture and fertility. He's most
similar to the gods of the Earth, but is less concerned with earthly powers (like
volcanoes) and more with weather and its effects on all living things.
<P></P>
The priesthood teaches the population to worship the deity of nature, and to
fear him. It stresses the fact that man is a small, insignificant thing next to
the grandeur of nature and must recognize that the sentient species are just
elements, ingredients, of nature. This philosophy doesn't sit well with most of
the sentient species, except the elves, who are in accord with it.
<P></P>
Nature-gods may be male or female.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with Druids and the priests of
Agriculture, Animals, Death, Earth, Fertility, Life-Death-Rebirth Cycle, Lightning,
Race (Elf), Seasons, Sky/Weather, Thunder, and Vegetation.
