In every area and every region throughout the world, traveling musicians
wandered throughout the land. They moved from town to town, making a living by
plying their trade as artists of sound and motion. In the AD&amp;D? game, adventurers
who do this are called <I>bards</I>.
<P></P>
Historically, bards were the poet-musicians of the Celtic peoples living in
the British Isles (the Irish, Welsh, and Scots). Bards composed music, sang
songs, and entertained their masters. Usually they worked for noblemen and spent
their time honoring these noblemen and their families in song and music. Bards
often accompanied their songs on the <I>crwth</I>, a type of lyre. Since their music wasn't written down, most of it has
vanished.
<P></P>
During the early Middle Ages, bards had considerable political power and
influence in the royal houses. However, in 1284 A.D., Edward I conquered Wales; the
resulting turmoil reduced the importance of bards. Noblemen had more pressing
concerns, and bards were left to fend for themselves. A few lingered on, into
the 17th and 18th centuries in Ireland and Scotland as folk singers and
musicians, but they eventually vanished along with their music.
<P></P>
During the 19th century, a determined effort was made to revive the bardic
tradition. Folk music gatherings took place in and near Wales. These neo-bardic
activities caught on among the public, and today the annual Eisteddfod folk
festival is a popular and growing event in this region of the world.
<P></P>
Thus, bards have shown a cunning knack to survive through the ages. In one
form or another, bards have been around for nearly 1,000 years. Besides the
Eisteddfod festival, the bard has been immortalized in the genre of fantasy. Now you
have a chance to continue the bardic tradition. This book covers not only the
traditional bard, but expands the class with new and unique character kits. All
of these kits involve some form of live entertainment, as all bards are
entertainers at heart. Nearly half of these kits entertain through music in one form
or another: poetry, song, instruments, etc. But some present such diverse new
kits as the Blade, who entertains through creative weapon displays, knife
throwing, and sword swallowing. Read on and enjoy.
