By means of a <I>dimension door</I> spell, the wizard instantly transfers himself up to 30 yards distance per
level of experience. This special form of teleportation allows for no error, and
the wizard always arrives at exactly the spot desired--whether by simply
visualizing the area (within spell transfer distance, of course) or by stating
direction such as, ?300 yards straight downward,? or, ?upward to the northwest, 45
degree angle, 420 yards.? If the wizard arrives in a place that is already
occupied by a solid body, he remains trapped in the Astral Plane. If distances are
stated and the spellcaster arrives with no support below his feet (i.e., in
mid-air), falling and damage result unless further magical means are employed. All
that the wizard wears or carries, subject to a maximum weight equal to 500 pounds
of nonliving matter, or half that amount of living matter, is transferred with
the spellcaster. Recovery from use of a <I>dimension door</I> spell requires one round.
