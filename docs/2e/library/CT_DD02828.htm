</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Creatures tend to fight as cleverly as they can, and a creature?s intelligence
is what determines how clever it can be:

The creature just reacts to what its senses tell it. It is not capable of
assessing the dangers it faces or the rewards it stands to gain. In a fight, a
nonintelligent creature turns its attention to the most immediate threat. When
badly hurt, a nonintelligent creature usually flees, but some creatures just don?t
know when they?re hurt and fight on, ignorant of any danger. Nonintelligent
creatures? combat actions usually are limited to attack or charge. If they flee,
they run or sprint rather than withdraw. They do not employ any of the special
battle tactics or attack options presented in <A HREF="DD02424.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02424.htm">Chapter One</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.

The creature has a limited ability to asses risks and rewards. Generally, it
responds only to very basic motivations and does not attack unless it is trained
to, it is hungry, or it is defending something it values (such as food,
offspring, a mate, or hunting territory). In a fight, an animal intelligence creature
relies on its instincts. It attacks the most accessible opponent, the opponent
that is most likely to be edible, or the opponent that scared it into
attacking. The creature has some grasp of tactics, enough to know that flank attacks
are better than frontal attacks and that rear attacks are better than flank
attacks. The creature also instinctively understands the value of not being detected
prior to its attacks.

Animal intelligence creatures usually flee if badly injured, but can fight to
the death if trapped or cornered. An animal intelligence creature?s combat
actions can include attack, charge, guard (such as a cat waiting at a mouse hole),
run, and sprint. Like nonintelligent creatures, they do not use battle tactics
or attack options.

<P></P>
The creature has some ability to assess risks and rewards and is smart enough
to delay an attack until a good opportunity presents itself. It is capable of
learning something about its opponents? abilities. A lion or tiger, for example,
knows enough to stay downwind of creatures that depend on scent and to stay
behind creatures that depend on sight. With experience, the creature probably can
learn to recognize missile and melee weapons and to direct attacks at lightly
armed characters. If the creature has encountered missile weapons, it learns to
recognize the value of cover. Otherwise it is limited to attacking, charging,
guarding, running, and sprinting.

<P></P>
The creature relies more on experience and reasoning than instincts. It is
generally aware of risks and rewards. It can make simple plans and can employ any
attack option that it is equipped to use. For example, a low intelligence
creature can employ missile weapons, but only if they are available. Most battle
options are still beyond the creature?s grasp, but it can make unarmed attacks,
ride a mount, and maybe join a spear hedge or shield wall (see <A HREF="DD02473.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02473.htm">Chapter One</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">).

The creature might occasionally act from impulse, but generally relies on
reasoning and observation to make decisions, and it can think beyond the obvious.
The creature has a good appreciation of risks and rewards, but this is limited
by its experience. It is capable of planning and organizing its actions and
coordinating them with others. The creature can use any of the attack options,
battle tactics, and combat options presented in <A HREF="DD02424.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02424.htm">Chapter One</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.

The creature generally is not impulsive. In battle, it thinks ahead and
considers how its current actions might affect its options in the future. The
creature is very flexible, and can alter its tactics to fit an unforeseen situation.
The creature can use any of the attack options, battle tactics, and combat

<P></P>
The creature is very insightful and almost never impulsive. It plans for the
future and always carefully measures risks against rewards. Any scheme or
subterfuge it employs is apt to be hard to detect and very deadly.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The creature can make correct deductions from incomplete information. It is
invariably knows the most appropriate action to take in any situation. (Though it
might not always take it; godlike beings are hard to understand.) To reflect
the creature?s superior intellect, the DM might decide to make the PCs declare
their actions before deciding what the creature does in a given combat round.
