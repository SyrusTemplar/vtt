create a variety of sounds. To a listener the source of the sound will seem to be
anywhere within 60 feet of the piper. The possible sounds that can be created
are: wind blowing, laughter, whistling, bird calls, moaning, footsteps, crying,
mumbled voices, screams, running water, or creaking. (Note: The DM can rule
that other similar sounds are possible.)
