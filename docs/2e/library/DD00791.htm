<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ring of Fire Resistance:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The wearer of this ring is totally immune to the effects of normal
firesâ€”torches, flaming oil, bonfires, etc. Very large and hot fires, molten lava,
hell-hound breath, or a <I>wall of fire</I> spell will cause 10 hit points of damage per round if the wearer is directly
within the conflagration.
<P></P>
Exceptionally hot fires such as red-dragon breath, pyrohydra breath,
fireballs, flame strike, fire storm, etc., are saved against with a +4 bonus to the die
roll, and all damage dice are calculated at -2 per die, but each die is never
less than 1 in any event. As a rule of thumb, consider very hot fires as those
that have a maximum initial exposure of up to 24 hit points, those of
exceptional heat (25 or more hit points).
