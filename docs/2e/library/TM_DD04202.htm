This spell is effective only on the night of a full moon and one night
immediately preceding and following it.
<P></P>
For the spell to be effective, the caster and the lycanthrope must be on the
same plane of existence; there is no other range limitation. When the spell is
cast, the nearest lycanthrope (as determined by the DM) of the chosen species
must attempt a saving throw. If successful, the creature is unaffected. If it
fails, the lycanthrope instantly appears near the caster.
<P></P>
Upon arrival, the creature can freely attack the wizard unless the caster has
created a warding circle. If a circle is present, the lycanthrope appears in
the circle; otherwise, it appears 1d10 feet away from the caster in a random
direction (the DM should use the scatter diagram for grenade-like missiles found in
the <I>DUNGEON MASTER</I>? Guide to determine direction).
<P></P>
A warding circle is a temporary prison drawn with specially prepared pigments
laced with silver filings. These pigments cost 100 gp for each foot of diameter
of the circle (thus, a circle 10 feet across costs 1,000 gp). A warding circle
must be at least 5 feet in diameter; if smaller, the lycanthrope is
automatically freed. Preparing the circle takes one turn per foot of diameter.
<P></P>
Even with such protection, the lycanthrope can break out of the circle and
wreak vengeance upon the summoner. The creature's base chance of success is 20%,
modified by the difference between its Hit Dice and the wizard's experience
level. If the spellcaster is of a higher level, the difference is subtracted from
the creature's chance of escaping the circle. If the lycanthrope is of higher
Hit Dice than the wizard's level, the difference is added to its chance. Each
creature is allowed only one attempt to escape.
<P></P>
Any break in the circle spoils the power of the spell and enables the
lycanthrope to break free. Even a straw dropped across the line of a magic circle
destroys its power. Fortunately, the creature cannot take any action against any
portion of the ward, for the magic of the barrier absolutely prevents this.
<P></P>
Once safely ensnared, the lycanthrope can be held for as long as the summoner
dares. The creature cannot leave the circle, nor can any of its attacks or
powers penetrate the magical barrier. When the full moon sets, the lycanthrope
reverts to its human form. At this time, it is free of the spell and may leave the
circle.
<P></P>
The material components are a drop of blood from any animal, a human hair, and
a moonstone worth at least 150 gp. If the caster elects to create the warding
circle, the components described above are also required.
