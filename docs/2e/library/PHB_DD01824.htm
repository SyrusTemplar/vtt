When this spell is cast, the creature(s) or object(s) affected immediately
assumes the mass of a piece of down. The rate of falling is instantly changed to a
mere 2 feet per second (120 feet per round), and no damage is incurred upon
landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration ceases, a
normal rate of fall occurs. The spell can be cast upon the wizard or some other
creature or object up to the maximum range and lasts for one round for each
level of the wizard. The <I>feather fall</I> affects one or more objects or creatures in a 10-foot cube, as long as the
maximum weight of the creatures or objects does not exceed a combined total of
200 pounds plus 200 pounds per level of the spellcaster.
<P></P>
For example, a 2nd-level wizard has a range of 20 yards, a duration of two
rounds, and a weight limit of 600 pounds when casting this spell. The spell works
only upon free-falling, flying, or propelled objects (such as missiles). It
does not affect a sword blow or a charging creature. Note that the spell can be
effectively combined with <I>gust of wind</I> and similar spells.
