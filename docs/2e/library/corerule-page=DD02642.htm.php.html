</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">By spending a second slot on mastery, a character can become a <I>high master</I>. By this time, the character has spent four slots on a single weapon and is
at least 6th level. High masters increase the speed factor of their chosen
weapon by one category; for example, a slow weapon in the hands of a high master is
automatically considered to be of average speed. High masters also score
critical hits on rolls of 16 or higher rather than 18 (if the optional critical hit
system is used) that hit their opponent by a margin of 5 or more.
<P></P>
High masters who specialize in bows, crossbows, slings, or firearms gain a new
range category: extreme range. For all weapons, extreme range is 1/3 farther
than long range. For example, if a weapon has a normal maximum range of 18
squares, in the hands of a master it can shoot 24 (1/3x18=6, 18+6=24) squares.
Extreme range shots have a â€“10 penalty to hit before adjustments are made for the
effects of mastery.
