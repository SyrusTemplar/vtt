When this spell is cast, the subject area instantly undergoes a change from
liquid to powdery dust. Note that if the water is already muddy, the area of
effect is doubled, while if wet mud is being transmuted, the area of effect is
quadrupled. If water remains in contact with the transmuted dust, the former
quickly soaks the latter, turning the dust into silty mud (if a sufficient quantity
of water exists to do so), otherwise soaking or dampening the dust accordingly.
<P></P>
Only liquid actually in the area of effect at the moment of spellcasting is
affected. Liquids that are only partially water are affected only insofar as the
actual water content is concerned; however, potions containing water are
rendered useless. Living creatures are unaffected, except for those native to the
Elemental Plane of Water. Such creatures receive saving throws vs. spell. Failure
inflicts 1d6 points of damage per caster level upon the subject, while success
means the creature receives half damage. Only one such creature can be affected
by any single casting of this spell, regardless of the creature's size or the
size of the spell's area of effect.
<P></P>
The reverse of the spell is simply a very high-powered <I>create water</I> spell that requires a pinch of normal dust as an additional material
component.
<P></P>
For either usage of the spell, other components required are diamond dust of
at least 500 gp value and a bit of seashell.
