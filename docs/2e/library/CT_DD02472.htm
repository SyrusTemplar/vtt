Innovations of equipment and maneuver often gave armies domination of their world.
Alexander’s phalanxes of spearmen were nearly unstoppable. Pikes and bows brought
about the end of the knight’s battlefield supremacy long before firearms were
effective weapons.

Some of these same tactics can be used to good effect by player characters and
their opponents. Even the most foolhardy barbarian should think twice before
charging a band of orcs who have formed a spear-hedge to receive his attack.
