<I>Do you think that a city, an army, or bandits, or thieves, or any other group
that attempted any action in common, could accomplish anything if they wronged
one another?
<P></P>
<P></P>

One of the things that distinguishes a &quot;professional&quot; thief from the more
common, vulgar variety is his understanding, like Plato's, of the delicate balance
of justice that even thieves must maintain among themselves to be successful.
<P></P>
Many thieves wish to be regarded as professionals. It is a privileged status,
indicating success and the respect of the underworld. It can be an asset for
business, bringing more and more lucrative jobs. Even in places not claimed as
territory by guilds, there are circles of professional thieves, form the elite
of the underworld.
<P></P>
The most basic qualification of a professional is that he is recognized as
such by other professionals. This recognition is not easy to gain. A thief must
build a reputation for excellence, reliability, and honor among his business
partners.
<P></P>
A would-be professional also needs to hang out in the &quot;right spots&quot;, taverns
and such establishments, particular places where the professional clique
gathers. There they relax, share information, and make contacts and arrangements for
professional cooperation with other thieves.
<P></P>
Attitude is the first element to be adopted by the aspiring professional. The
professional attitude says thieving is a business, and should be conducted as
neither more nor less than one. The professional is not contemptuous of his
victims; they simply failed to protect their property adequately, and suffered
the economic consequences.
<P></P>
Professionals develop an unwritten code of conduct, guidelines for behavior.
Its exact contents vary from place to place; the only universal rule seems to
be the prohibition of &quot;squealing.&quot; A typical &quot;code&quot; is as follows, with its
elements listed in order of importance:
<P></P>
<P></P>
1. A professional thief does not &quot;squeal&quot;: If captures by authorities in the
course or as a consequence of a job, he must not reveal the identities of his
partners, fences, informants, or other professional contacts.
<P></P>
<P></P>
2. A professional thief will honestly report how much money or valuables are
taken in a job; he will not &quot;burn&quot; his partners.
<P></P>
<P></P>
3. A mob of professional thieves will share their score equally among
themselves, or according to the contribution of each to the job, arranged and agreed
upon beforehand.
<P></P>
<P></P>
4. A professional thief will share some of his earnings with other
professional thieves who have been incarcerated (to help pay fines, bribe officials, etc.).
<P></P>
<P></P>
5. If a professional thief has valuable information (e.g., attractive targets,
location of traps, and the activities of the town watch), he will share it
with other professionals.
<P></P>
<P></P>
6. Professional thieves will help one another, even in spite of personal
differences or enmity between them.
<P></P>
<P></P>
As stated above, not all of these rules are recognized in each circle of
professional thieves; but some sense of honor is vital to the attitude and behavior
that mark a professional and gain him the recognition as a &quot;good burglar.&quot; The
penalty for breaking the professional code can be at least as severe as
breaking the law. A few transgression may be overlooked by the criminal community,
but a pattern of consistent disregard for the code will cause a character's
reputation to deteriorate. Other thiees will not invite the character to be a
partner in jobs; silence and cold stares will greet him at his favorite social
establishments; and fences may even refuse to purchase the goods he acquires. He
also runs the risk of former associates squealing on him.
<P></P>
In the worst situation?say, a thief burns his partners, squeals on them, and
then skips town for some foreign port?the offending thief could not only be
expect his professional reputation to be ruined, but he had better keep an eye over
his shoulder, watching for assassins and bounty hunters hired by his former
associates, or by their friends or families.
<P></P>
On the other hand, there are considerable benefits for the thief who adheres
to the code. He will gain the respect and trust of his associates. He is not
immune from dishonorable thieves, who may try to burn him or squeal on him; but
he will have the support and approval of others in exacting revenge on those
who wrong him. Also, if he is captured and imprisoned by authorities, he can
expect the privilege of the fix; the guild contacts (or less formal contacts) may
arrange his release through bribes or favors. Even if the professional does
not have access to the money needed, other thieves, knowing that he'd do the same
for them, will pitch in until the necessary amount has been gathered.
