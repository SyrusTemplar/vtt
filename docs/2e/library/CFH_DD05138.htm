<B>Description:</B> This is not the barbarian of history, but the barbarian of fantasy fiction.
He's a powerful warrior from a culture on the fringes of civilization. He's left
his home to sell his skills and adventure in the civilized world?perhaps to
amass a fortune with which to return home, perhaps to become an important figure
in this so-called civilization. He's known for strength, cunning, contempt for
the outer world's decadence, and for adhering to his own code of honor.
<P></P>
The barbarian is usually very strong; therefore, the barbarian<I> must have a Strength ability score of 15 or more.</I> A character can come from a barbarian tribe and have a lower Strength than
that?but he cannot have the Barbarian Kit.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> The typical RPG barbarian is a powerful, dangerous figure, as though he were
an animal totem in human skin. In a campaign, he's a front-line fighter with
some special skills and a very different outlook than the rest of the characters;
his player should always play him as someone from a different land, someone
whose likes and dislikes and perceptions are based on a different culture. (If
you play him as just another warrior from down the street, you lose a lot of the
mystique the character has.)
<P></P>
If the PC party has no real leader, he may gravitate to that role; if it has a
good enough leader, he'll probably stick to being a specialist in the things
he does well.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> The DM will decide, based on the character's background, what sort of
secondary skill would be required. Most barbarian tribes have a required skill; a
tribe that makes its living by fishing would have Fisher as its required secondary
skill.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Required: Battle Axe, Bastard Sword. (These are the classical
fiction-barbarian weapons; the DM may decide to substitute others more appropriate to his own
world.) Barbarian fighters may specialize in any weapon, but are not likely to
encounter unusual weapons (like lances, quarterstaves, flails, peculiar
polearms) until they reach the outer world. Recommended: Bow (any), Sling, Sword
(any), War Hammer.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Bonus Proficiency: Endurance. Recommended: General?Animal Handling, Animal
Training, Direction Sense, Fire-Building, Riding (Land-Based), Weather Sense,
(Warrior) Blind-Fighting, Hunting, Mountaineering, Running, Set Snares, Survival,
Tracking, (Priest?costs twice the listed number of slots if Fighter or Ranger,
or just the listed number if Paladin) Herbalism, (Rogue?costs double slots)
Jumping. The DM is within his rights to insist that the Barbarian character take a
proficiency in the tribal specialty (Fishing, Agriculture, whatever) if the DM
so wishes.
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> The character, when he spends his starting gold, may not buy armor heavier
than splint mail, banded mail, or bronze plate mail. Outside his tribe, once he
has adventured in the outer world, he can use any type of armor without penalty.
When he spends his starting gold, he must limit himself to weapons the DM says
are appropriate for his tribe?the usual group of weapons includes battle axe,
bows (any), club, dagger or dirk, footman's flail, mace, or pick, hand or
throwing axe, sling, spear, or sword (any).
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> Barbarians are impressive because of sheer strength, intensity, and animal
magnetism; this gives them a +3 reaction adjustment bonus in certain situations.
<P></P>
Whenever the barbarian character achieves a reaction roll of 8 or less
(including Charisma and racial bonuses), you subtract the modifier. That is, if the
reaction is positive at all, it will be even more positive than it otherwise
would have been.
<P></P>
<I>Example: Torath the Toranaran is a Barbarian with a Charisma of 15.
Encountering a knight who could be friend or foe to him, he speaks with the knight in a
friendly fashion. The DM rolls his Encounter Reaction and achieves an 11 on
2d10. On the &quot;Friendly&quot; column of the Encounter Reactions chart from the Dungeon
Master Guide, this is a &quot;Cautious&quot; reaction.</I>
<P></P>
<I>But wait?his charisma gives him a +3 bonus. The 11 becomes an 8, still an
indifferent reaction. But because he's reached an 8, his Barbarian bonus comes into
play, making the final reaction roll a 5: A friendly reaction.
<P></P>
</I> <B>Special Hindrances:</B> All that impressiveness can work against the Barbarian, too. Whenever the
barbarian character achieves a reaction roll of 14 or more, he takes an additional
?3 modifier. That is, if the reaction is negative at all, it will be even more
negative than it otherwise would have been?the barbarian is scary, and the
other person overreacts.
<P></P>
<I>Example: Torath next meets a suspicious witch, and is indifferent toward her.
On the &quot;Indifferent&quot; column of the Encounter Reactions chart, the DM rolls a
17. Torath's Charisma bonus of 3 reduces the roll to a 14, but it's still enough
that his Barbarian penalty just shoots it right back up to a 17 again. The
witch becomes Threatening.
<P></P>
</I> <B>Wealth Options:</B> The Barbarian gets the starting gold for a Warrior (5d4x10 gp), but he must
spend it all (before starting play) except three gp or less; he can have some
pocket change when he reaches civilization, but must be close to penniless.
<P></P>
<B>Races:</B> Demihuman Barbarians follow the same rules. Dwarves are perhaps the most
admirably suited to being Barbarians. The DM will have to decide whether his elves,
half-elves and gnomes are brooding and menacing enough to be Barbarians; the
question is even harder with the leisure-loving halflings. But if the DM wishes
to allow any or all of these demihuman races to have Barbarians among them, he
may.
<P></P>
<B>Final Note:</B> Most classic fantasy-fiction barbarians are male, but this Warrior Kit can
certainly be taken by female characters, with all the Kit's requirements,
benefits, and hindrances in effect.
