neutral alignment and animal intelligence, the creatures must roll saving throws vs.
spell. If they succeed, they move rapidly away from the ring wearer. If the
saving throws fail, the creatures become docile and follow the ring wearer
around. The item functions at 6th level, so up to 12 Hit Dice of animals can be
affected by this ring.
<P></P>
Animals feeling friendship for the wearer will actually guard and protect that
individual if he expends a charge from the ring to cause such behavior. A ring
of this sort typically has 27 charges when discovered, and it cannot be
recharged. A druid wearing this ring can influence twice the prescribed Hit Dice
worth of animals (24 rather than 12), and a ranger is able to influence 18 Hit Dice
worth of animals.
