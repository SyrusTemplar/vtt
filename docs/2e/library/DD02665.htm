Group: General Initial rating: 3
<P></P>
Sometimes known as a danger sense, this talent gives the character a chance to
detect otherwise undetectable threats by instinct. The character?s trouble
sense comes into play when the character is threatened by a danger he hasn?t
noticed yet.
<P></P>
The DM should make trouble sense checks in secret. If the character succeeds,
he is only surprised on a roll of 1 by a sneak attack and treats any rear
attacks as flank attacks instead. The DM can modify the proficiency check if the
character is taking extra precautions or if the attacker would be particularly
hard to notice before striking.
