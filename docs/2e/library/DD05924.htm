No table is given for randomly determining these special resources, because
they require careful attention and thought on the part of the DM. From the list
below, the DM should select a small number (or none, for a small guild) which
will suit the campaign. This list is only a partial one, and the DM can add
similar special resources:
<P></P>
<I>Tame Mage:</I> The guild has a helpful mage on tap, who casts spells to help thieves (but
doesn't take risks). If the guild has a mage/thief or two, this mage is of higher
level, and may train these mage/thieves.
<P></P>
<I>Tame Cleric:</I> A rarer instance, but possible if the cleric is very chaotic, a renegade,
etc. In some specific mythoi this might not be a rare case at all (for example,
clerics of Mask in Faerun).
<P></P>
<I>Expert Fence:</I> The guild works regularly with, or has, a fence with truly exceptional
knowledge, information networks, and/or the ability to ship hot goods out of the
country fast.
<P></P>
<I>Government Snitch:</I> The guild's man in City Hall. Very helpful in telling the Guild about the
shipment of government goods, the Mint, secrets of political NPCs for blackmail,
and lots more.
<P></P>
<I>Merchant Snitch:</I> The guild's man in the warehouses, docks, etc. Not a nightwatchman, but
someone much more important-a harbormaster, Commander of the Night Watch, etc. Can
supply the guild with watch hours, incoming and stored cargo lists, and much
more.
<P></P>
<I>A Friend at Court:</I> A person with the ear of the King/Queen/Baron/Royal Physician/Courtesan/Bimbo
Princess. Subtly different from a government snitch, and more suited to a
swashbuckling rogue campaign or guild.
<P></P>
<I>Friends in other Guild(s): </I>The guild has very cordial relations with the thieves' guild in a major city,
even the capital, for reasons of blood relation, old friendships and
co-adventuring, etc.
<P></P>
These special resources clearly open up all kinds of adventure possibilities.
Getting a message to the important NPC is a standard option, obtaining a reward
for them is another (e.g., the tame mage wants that nice wand of lightning his
enemy has and could the guild steal it for him?), rescuing them from
imprisonment is a third. Subtler possibilities could include finding out who has found
out about the guild's Government Snitch and is blackmailing him for a fortune,
and the like.
