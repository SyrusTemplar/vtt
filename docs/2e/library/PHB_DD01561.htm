himself look like any general type of person of about the same height, age,
weight, and race. A successful proficiency check indicates that the disguise is
successful, while a failed roll means the attempt was too obvious in some way.

The character can also disguise himself as a member of another race or sex. In
this case, a -7 penalty is applied to the proficiency check. The character may
also attempt to disguise himself as a specific person, with a -10 penalty to
the proficiency check. These modifiers are cumulative, thus, it is extremely
difficult for a character to disguise himself as a specific person of another race
or sex (a -17 penalty to the check).
