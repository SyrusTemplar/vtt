When a<I> fire storm</I> spell is cast, the whole area is shot through with sheets of roaring flame
that equal a<I> wall of fire</I> spell in effect. Creatures within the area of fire and 10 feet or less from
the edge of the affected area receive 2d8 points of damage plus additional
damage equal to the caster's level (2d8 +1/level). Creatures that roll successful
saving throws vs. spell suffer only one-half damage. The damage is inflicted each
round the creature stays in the area of effect. The area of effect is equal to
two 10-foot x 10-foot cubes per level of the cater--e.g., a 13th-level caster
can cast a<I> fire storm</I> measuring 130 feet x 20 feet x 10 feet. The height of the storm is 10 or 20
feet; the imbalance of its area must be in length and width.
<P></P>
The reverse spell,<I> fire quench</I>, smothers twice the area of effect of a<I> fire storm</I> spell with respect to normal fires, and the normal area of effect with
respect to magical fires. Fire-based creatures, such as elementals, salamanders,
etc., of less than demigod status have a 5% chance per experience level of the
caster of being extinguished. If cast only against a <I>flametongue</I> sword, the sword must roll a successful saving throw vs. crushing blow or be
rendered nonmagical. Such a sword in the possession of a creature first
receives the creature's saving throw, and if this is successful, the second saving
throw is automatically successful.
