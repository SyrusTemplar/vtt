</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Similar to the Restricted School Campaign, in this variation, high-level magic
does not exist. For instance, the DM might decide that no spells of 6th level
or higher exist. Therefore, a wizard has access to spells of 1st level through
5th level only, and he is unable to research higher-level spells. As with the
Restricted School Campaign, the DM decides whether magical devices duplicating
the effects of higher-level spells exist.
