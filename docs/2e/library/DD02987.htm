<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Outlaw</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> These characters spit in the face of authority and scoff at the mention of
-the law.- They are men and women wanted by the campaign-s government officials
and law-enforcement authorities.
<P></P>
Some outlaws are the heroic Robin Hood type. They become outlaws because they
oppose an evil, corrupt, or tyrannical regime. These outlaws are more concerned
with justice than the strict letter of the law. And while they willingly break
laws, they do it for the common good-robbing from the rich to give to the
poor, smiting the minions of the vile administration, and generally making life as
uncomfortable as possible for those who-ve turned the law to their own wicked
ends.
<P></P>
Other outlaws are bandits and highwaymen who inhabit the fringes of many
civilizations hoping to rob innocent passersby of their hard-earned valuables. These
despicable louts truly give the term -outlaw? a bad name.

determine an outlaw-s social rank.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Requirements:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> As many Outlaws must leave the comforts of civilization behind to avoid
capture, they must be hardy souls. All outlaws must have minimum Strength/Stamina
and Constitution/Health scores of 12. This kit is open to all races and classes,
but paladin outlaws require special approval from the DM.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Outlaws can wield whatever weapons are allowed by their class. However, they
tend to favor missile weapons because they like to strike at the forces of the
law from a safe distance.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended nonweapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Rope use, set snares, survival tracking, fire-building, riding (any), animal
lore, bowyer/fletcher, hunting, running, local history, disguise, tumbling.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Equipment:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Characters who are on the run, such as outlaws, are apt to be lightly
equipped to allow for quick, quiet movements.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended traits: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Alertness, internal compass, glibness, impersonation, keen senses, light
sleeper, lucky.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Benefits:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Outlaws have a designated hideaway, a place where they can feel safe.
Possible locations include a grove in the local forest, a hidden valley, the city-s
sewer system, or a nearby dungeon. The DM and player should work out the
specifics.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hindrances:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Outlaws always have someone out to get them-usually the collective force of
the campaign-s law enforcers. They might have some player characters after them,
too, if the bounty on their head becomes tempting enough.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wealth:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Standard for the character-s class.
