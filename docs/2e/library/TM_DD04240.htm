This powerful spell creates a disruption in magical forces similar to the
conditions found in wild magic regions (areas where the effects of magic have been
permanently altered). This spell has only a temporary effect, although the
effects of <I>wildzone</I> could possibly be rendered permanent.
<P></P>
The spell creates a wild magic region centered on the caster. The area of
effect cannot be shaped in any way; it is <I>always</I> a square 300 feet long on each side (90,000 square feet).
<P></P>
Within the <I>wildzone</I>, wild magic reigns. Any spell cast in the area of effect is automatically
treated as a wild surge (see <A HREF="DD04136.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD04136.htm">Table 2</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">). Effects from magical items that expend charges are also treated as wild
surges when used in the area. Other magical items function normally.
<P></P>
Spells cast into the <I>wildzone</I> from outside the area of effect function normally, but spells cannot be cast
out of the area of effect without triggering a wild surge.
<P></P>
The material components are several pots of paint which must be spilled across
a sheet of hammered silver worth no less than 2,000 gp.
