This spell reverses the ethics of a person or group of people. While under the
influence of this spell, a creature behaves in a manner opposite to the way he
normally would behave. Thus, a shopkeeper influenced by inverted ethics will
think it perfectly normal for someone to pick up an item from his shop and walk
out the door without paying for it. If someone tried to pay for an item, he
would be insulted. If the spell is cast on a shopper in a store, he would find it
natural to steal the item, thinking that he is behaving in a proper way. If the
spell is cast on a professed thief, he will no longer steal, choosing to pay
for his goods instead.
<P></P>
<I>Inverted ethics</I> does not cause a creature to actively commit evil deeds (or good deeds).
Thus, an affected creature will not go on a shoplifting rampage; he will steal only
as the opportunity presents itself.
<P></P>
The spell affects one character per level of the caster within a 20' radius.
Each target of the spell is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect.
<P></P>
The material component is a miniature golden balance (i.e., similar to the
scales of justice).
