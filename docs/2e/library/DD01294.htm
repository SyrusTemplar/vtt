</B>Creating the Arena</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The arena is a magical construct that the combatants must forge
cooperatively. To form the arena, the two opponents must participate in a protocol similar
to casting a spell. They begin by standing at arm-s length, then circle each
other, chanting and gesturing for a full turn. If the combatants? concentration
is disturbed before the arena is completed, the preparations must begin again.
Typical disturbances include anything that would normally prevent spellcasting,
but even loud noises can ruin the creation process.
<P></P>
The mediator then casts some kind of protective spell over the combatants. <I>Wall of force </I>is the usual choice, but any protective spell that encompasses the two
combatants is sufficient. The combatants now have the option of contributing their own
spells. The spells contributed need not be protective spells, but they must be
currently memorized. A contributed spell disappears from the character-s
memory as though it had been cast; the spell does not have its normal effect but
instead helps determine how large the arena is, which combatant has the advantage,
and how severe the consequences of defeat are (see below). Unscrupulous
characters might contribute multiple spells or spells stored in scrolls or other
devices to increase their chances of gaining the
<P></P>
initial advantage and to raise the stakes beyond what the opponent would
willingly undertake.
<P></P>
Spells contributed to the arena are recorded secretly by the players involved.
The characters involved in the duel cannot tell how many spells their opponent
is contributing or how long the opponent spends casting them, but the mediator
is aware of the spells contributed by both sides.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Balance of Power (Optional)
<P></P>
</B> If the two opponents are not the same level, the number of spell levels each
character contributes to the arena cannot exceed the weaker opponent-s level.
For example, if Calvin, a 7th-level wizard, is dueling Delsenora, a 12th-level
priest, neither character could contribute a spell higher than 7th level or
multiple spells totaling seven levels or more. There is no limit to the number of
spells that can be contributed if both opponents are the same level.
<P></P>
<P></P>
When the arena is complete, the two combatants are standing still with a ball
of shimmering force hovering between them. A close look at the ball reveals
tiny images of the two combatants floating opposite each other. The images are
mental constructs that represent the combatants in the duel.
<P></P>
Characters must willingly cooperate to form an arena and conduct a duel. A
character under a magical or psionic compulsion, such as a <I>charm person</I> or <I>suggestion</I> spell, cannot be forced to give consent. A character can be intimidated into
giving consent in any number of ways, including a <I>geas</I> or <I>quest</I> spell. Consent given under threat is still consent for purposes of a magical
duel as long as the character in question is free to think for himself. In the
case of a <I>geas </I>or <I>quest</I> spell, the subject is free to ignore the request for a duel and face the
consequences.
