Cantrips are minor spells studied by wizards during their apprenticeship,
regardless of school. The <I>cantrip</I> spell is a practice method for the apprentice, teaching him how to tap minute
amounts of magical energy. Once cast, the <I>cantrip</I> spell enables the caster to create minor magical effects for the duration of
the spell. However, these effects are so minor that they have severe
limitations. They are completely unable to cause a loss of hit points, cannot affect the
concentration of spellcasters, and can only create small, obviously magical
materials. Furthermore, materials created by a cantrip are extremely fragile and
cannot be used as tools of any sort. Lastly, a cantrip lacks the power to
duplicate any other spell effects.

Whatever manifestation the cantrip takes, it remains in effect only as long as
the wizard concentrates. Wizards typically use cantrips to impress common
folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives. Common tricks with cantrips
include tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, glowing balls that
float over the caster's hand, puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas
and flavors of bland food, and little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs.
Combined with the <I>unseen servant</I> spell, it's a tool to make housekeeping and entertaining simpler for the
wizard.
