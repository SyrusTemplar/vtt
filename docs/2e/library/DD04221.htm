<P></P>
This spell causes a tentacle of magical flame to snake forth from any existing
source of natural or magical fire. The flaming tendril is 10 feet long, has AC
7, can be hit only by magical weapons of +2 or better, and has hit points
equal to double the caster's level.
<P></P>
Any creature within 20 feet of the tentacle is subject to attack as directed
by the caster. The victim must attempt a saving throw; if successful, the
subject has avoided entanglement, but suffers 1d6 points of fire damage from contact
with the tendril. If the saving throw is failed, the victim is entangled by the
flaming serpent and suffers 3d6 points of fire damage each round until the
tendril is destroyed or the spell expires.
<P></P>
If the fire source from which the tentacle emanates is extinguished, the
remaining time that the fiery constrictor may exist is cut in half.
<P></P>
The material component is a red dragon's scale.
