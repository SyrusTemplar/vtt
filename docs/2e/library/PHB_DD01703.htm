<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There are times when a character wants to defeat another being without killing
it. A companion may have been charmed into attacking his friends (and his
friends don't want to kill him to save themselves!); an enemy may have information
the PCs can get only by subduing him; characters may simply see the monetary
value of bringing back a real, live monster. Whatever the case, sooner or later
characters are going to try.
<P></P>
There are three types of nonlethal attacks--punching, wrestling, and
overbearing. Punching is basic bare-fisted fighting. Wrestling is the classic
combination of grappling, holds, and throws. Overbearing is simply trying to pull down an
opponent by sheer mass or weight of numbers, pinning him to the ground.
