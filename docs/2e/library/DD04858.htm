Gnomes are famous, or perhaps infamous, for their sardonic sense of humor. All
gnomes love practical jokes, the more elaborate the better. This can be very
disconcerting when a gnome decides to express friendship or affection to a
non-gnome by making that individual a special target for a string of practical
jokes. As a rule, it's considered bad form to devise a joke which actually hurts
somebody; the art comes from surprising the victim and making him or her look
ridiculous.

In a way, practical joking takes the place filled by violence in many human
cultures; two gnomes who have a heated argument are more likely to launch a feud
of booby-traps to prove who is the cleverest than come to blows. Taking their
cue from Garl Glittergold himself, gnomes extend this attitude to their military
endeavors; it's considered a more courageous act to make an enemy look foolish
in the eyes of his or her allies or followers than it is to kill the same
enemy.
