If a player wants his character to be ambidextrous, as described above under
&quot;Off-Hand Weapons Use,&quot; he must devote one weapon proficiency to Ambidexterity.
<P></P>
If he does so, he'll be able to fight normally with both hands, and will be
equally adept at non-combat tasks with both hands.
<P></P>
This doesn't give him two attacks per round. It just means that if he loses
the use of one hand, or drops the weapon in that hand, he'll be equally adept
with the other.
