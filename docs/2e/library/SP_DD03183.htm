The schools of magic that these wizards specialize in are unusual because
they are artificial: they contain only spells drawn from other, existing schools.
All of the usual rules regarding specialist wizards apply to these four,
unless the description states otherwise. Using these as a guide, players and DMs can
experiment with creating their own, unique specialist wizards.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> When a wizard character is created, and each time he advances in level, the
player can elect to spend 2 or more character points to acquire an additional
spell for his character’s spellbook. This is similar to the specialist wizard’s
ability to automatically add one spell of his specialty to his repertoire each
time he gains a level. The player is allowed to pick any spell his character
could normally cast (i.e., he can’t pick spells from opposing schools), and no roll
for learning the spell need be made.
<P></P>
The spell purchased with character points must be of equal or lower spell
level than the highest-level spell currently entered into the character’s book. The
cost is 2 character points for a 1st-level spell, +1 character point for each
level of the spell beyond first. For example, a 3rd-level spell would cost 4
character points; a 7th-level spell would cost 8 points.
<P></P>
No more than one additional spell can be acquired with character points when
the character is first created, and a character can add no more than one such
spell each time he advances a level of experience. However, this ability is
cumulative with a specialist wizard’s bonus spell—when a specialist wizard gains a
level, he learns one spell from his specialty school free, and can spend
additional character points to automatically learn a second spell from any school he
knows.

New Schools of Magic
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
As magic users in the multitude of campaign worlds have progressed in their
arts, an ever-greater diversity of styles and types of wizardry have been
developed. Growing from the rigid schools of opposing magical powers outlined in the <A HREF="PHB_DD01648.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="PHB_DD01648.htm">Player’s Handbook</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, more and more disciplines have branched out as young wizards have taken a
more liberal interpretation of their masters’ teachings. These developments have
resulted in new types of spellcasting, each of which focuses on the way in
which magic is drawn from the environment and bent to the wizard’s will.
<P></P>
When a wizard character is created (or an existing AD&amp;D character is converted
to Player’s Option rules), the player can elect for his character to
specialize in one of the following new schools of magic. These schools are similar to
the elemental wizard or wild mage introduced in the <A HREF="TM_DD04133.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="TM_DD04133.htm">Tome of Magic</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, but the new specialist wizards defined here—the alchemist, the shadow mage,
and the song wizard—have developed alternate styles of spellcasting and spell
organization.
<P></P>
The main purpose for specializing in a magic type is as an aid toward
effective role-playing, though the specialties can benefit and hinder characters in
various game situations. The use of these new magic types, like any other
subsystem in the AD&amp;D game, is subject to the DM’s approval. Several of these new
schools require a certain amount of campaign or encounter background. The powers of
the shadow mage, for example, vary with the prevalent lighting conditions, and
the DM must be prepared to answer a player’s questions about these conditions
any time the player character wishes to cast a spell.

<A NAME="6b4af1ba"></A><A NAME="6b4af1ba"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Choosing a Magic School Specialty
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> To select a specialty, a wizard character generally has to meet more demanding
ability score criteria than a standard mage, and he may have certain
backgrounds or origins (in other words, character kits) barred to him. A player is free
to choose any specialty the requirements of which his character meets.
Naturally, a player may wish to select his character’s specialty based on his own
interests—song wizards provide good role-playing for players inclined toward music,
while scientifically-minded players might enjoy an alchemist who can constantly
fuss with odd ingredients and complicated formulae.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Creating New Schools:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The magic types listed in this chapter are the most common examples of
alternate spellcasting techniques. However, other approaches are certainly possible.
If a player comes up with a great concept for defining a new school or
discipline of magic, he can do so with the DM’s approval. In turn, the DM should
carefully review the player’s design for concept, playability, and game balance
before allowing the new specialist in game play.
<P></P>
Generally, a specialist mage should have spells that he can cast with superior
skill, balanced by a loss of spells from outside his specialty. All
specialists should gain the standard extra spell memorization slot at each level, as well
as advantages in learning spells from their specialty and penalties for
learning generic spells. Last but not least, a specialist may have non-spellcasting
benefits or hindrances, such as the alchemist’s ability to create potions, or
modifiers to their saving throws.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Effects of Magic School Specialization
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Choosing a specialty provides a wizard character with a number of benefits.
For all the schools introduced in this chapter, the following advantages apply:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> A specialist gains one additional spell per spell level, provided the spell is
taken in the specialist’s school. Thus, a 1st-level alchemist can memorize two
spells instead of only one, as long as at least one of them is from the school
of alchemy.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Specialists receive a bonus of +15% when learning spells from their school,
and a penalty of –15% when learning spells from any other school. The bonus or
penalty is applied to the percentile roll the player must make when the character
is attempting to learn a new spell.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Whenever a specialist reaches a new spell level, he automatically gains one
spell of his school to add to his spell books. This can be selected by the DM or
he can allow the player to pick. No learn spells roll need be made.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> When a specialist wizard attempts to create a new spell using the rules given
in the <A HREF="DMG_DD00353.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00353.htm">DMG</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, the DM should count the new spell as one level lower if the spell falls
within the school of the specialist. An alchemist attempting to create a new
2nd-level alchemy spell conducts his research as if it were a 1st-level spell, since
the character has a superior understanding of his school.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Note that the saving throw modifiers granted to specialists in the <A HREF="PHB_DD01475.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="PHB_DD01475.htm">Player’s Handbook</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> and <A HREF="TM_DD04137.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="TM_DD04137.htm">Tome of Magic</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> aren’t abilities of the specialist wizards described in this book. They have
other abilities that are more specific to their particular methods of
spellcasting, described later in this chapter.
<P></P>
Specialist wizards also have several significant disadvantages to balance
their bonuses. First and foremost, each of the new schools described here have
opposition schools, just like specialists in the <A HREF="PHB_DD01475.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="PHB_DD01475.htm">Player’s Handbook</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">. A specialist cannot learn or cast spells from an opposing school, or use
magical items that duplicate the effects of spells from that school. Secondly, the
character has a reduced chance to learn spells of other non-opposing schools,
as noted above.
