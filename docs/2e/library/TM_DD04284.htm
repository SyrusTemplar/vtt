<P></P>

<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
This spell prevents creatures within the area of effect (or those who enter
it) from speaking any deliberate and knowing lies. Creatures are allowed a saving
throw to avoid the effects; those who fail the save are affected fully.
Affected characters are aware of this enchantment; therefore, they may avoid
answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie or they may be
evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth. When a character
leaves the area, he is free to speak as he chooses.
<P></P>
The spell affects a square whose sides are five feet long per level of the
caster; thus, a 4th-level priest could affect a 20 foot by 20 foot square.
<P></P>
The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a phony emerald,
ruby, or diamond.
