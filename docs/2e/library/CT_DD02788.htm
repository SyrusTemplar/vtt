</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A siege is a slow-moving process that can take months to resolve—not the best
subject for a heroic role-playing game. However, an artillery duel or an
attempt to storm a castle’s walls, supported and opposed by war machines, provides
lots of action for battle.

machines listed in this chapter. Defensive values for some common structures are
also included. Note that statistics for true fortifications are not included
