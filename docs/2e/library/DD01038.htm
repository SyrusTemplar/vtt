<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Rope of Climbing:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A 60-foot long <I>rope of climbing</I> is no thicker than a slender wand and weighs no more than three pounds, but
it is strong enough to support 3,000 pounds. Upon command, the rope will snake
forward, upward, downward, or any other direction at 10 feet per round and
attach itself securely wherever desired. It will return or unfasten itself in a
similar manner. A <I>rope of climbing</I> can also be commanded to knot itself. This causes large knots to appear at
1-foot intervals along the rope. Knotting shortens the rope to a 50-foot length
until the knots are untied. One end of the rope must be held by a character when
its magic is invoked.
