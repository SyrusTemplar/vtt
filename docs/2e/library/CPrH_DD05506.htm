Just about any spell can be adapted to a priest's Granted Power.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
Priest Granted Powers may not be derived from every spell on the books. Some
wizard schools and priest spheres are not permitted for adaptation to granted
powers. Normally, when a spell belongs to two schools or spheres, where one is
permitted and the other is not, the spell can still be adapted to a granted
power; but some exceptions are noted below.
<P></P>
Priest Granted Powers may be derived from wizard spells of the schools of
Abjuration, Alteration, Charm, Greater Divination, Invocation, Lesser Divination,
and Necromancy. They may also be derived from priest spells from the spheres of
All, Animal, Charm, Creation, Divination, Guardian, Healing, Plant, Protection,
Sun, and Weather.
<P></P>
Priest Granted Powers may <I>not</I> be derived from wizard spells of the schools of Conjuration, Summoning, or
Conjuration/Summoning; from Enchantment (spells listed as Enchantment/Charm are
permissible, but those listed as belonging to Enchantment and any other school
are not; for instance, <I>Leomund's Secure Shelter</I> , usable by Alteration and Enchantment, is not allowed); from Illusion or
Illusion/Phantasm; from Evocation (if a spell can belong to the school of
Evocation, it cannot be taken as a granted power even if it can be used by other
schools; for instance, <I>Melf's Minute Meteors,</I> usable by evocation and alteration, cannot be taken as a granted power).
<P></P>
Neither may they be derived from priest spells of the spheres of Astral,
Combat (even if a spell belongs to Combat and one other sphere, as <I>shillelagh</I> belongs to Combat and Plant, it cannot be used to make a Granted Power),
Elemental, Necromantic, or Summoning.
<P></P>
Note that priest spells are listed with wizard-school designations and with
spheres of influence (for example, <I>Animal Friendship </I>is shown as an Enchantment/Charm school and of the Animal sphere). When making
granted powers from priest spells, ignore the wizardly school and pay
attention only to the sphere of influence.

Granted Powers may not be derived from wizard spells of fifth level or higher,
or from priest spells of fourth level or higher.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The DM must determine limitations on the use of the Granted Power. (There's no
call for a priest to be using his power all the time, every day.)
<P></P>
If it's a power which is very useful in a lot of situations (for example, a
healing ability), it should be usable once, twice, or three times per day. The
more useful it is, the less a priest should be able to use it; thus, a healing
power would be usable once per day, while a detection ability might be usable
three times per day.
<P></P>
The DM can also choose for the power to take considerable time to use; special
powers should take a minimum of one round to use; more commonly, they should
take a complete turn.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>High, Medium, or Low</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
Once the DM knows which spell the power is derived from and how often and
easily it may be used, he can decide whether it is a High, Medium, or Low Power.
<P></P>
High Powers are those which frequently can dramatically affect the course of a
combat or otherwise affect an adventure. The examples of High Powers listed
above (charms, major immunities, the ability to inspire fear, shapechange, or
turn undead) can all have dramatic and powerful effects on an adventure in
progress.
<P></P>
Medium Powers are those which frequently give an advantage to the priest, or
which occasionally will dramatically affect the course of a combat or adventure.
The examples of Medium Powers listed above (defiance of obstacles, medium
immunities, inciting berserker rages, enhanced language abilities, laying on of
hands, and prophecy) all do these things.
<P></P>
Low Powers are those which only occasionally give an advantage to a priest,
but which are also very much in character for the priest and his god. The
examples of Low Powers listed above (detection and analysis, minor immunities, minor
enhancements to language abilities, soothing word) all meet that definition.
<P></P>
So, when a DM creates a new granted power, he must decide which of these three
sets of criteria the power meets, and define the power as High, Medium, or Low.
<P></P>
In any case, this definition is only a rule-of-thumb guideline to how powerful
the granted power is. It helps the DM when he's assigning powers to priests of
specific mythoi. For instance, if he has created a description of a priesthood
and decides that it's just almost powerful enough, and only needs a little
bonus (a Low Power) to make it just right, he'll be able to choose from his list
of available Low Powers and can ignore his listings of High and Medium Powers,
which would make that priesthood too powerful.
