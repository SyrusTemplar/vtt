This spell enhances a priest's ability to guard a person, place, or object.
The spell's effect must be centered on a specific area, for it creates an
invisible spherical boundary up to 10 feet in diameter. The effect is not mobile; it
cannot move with a living creature.
<P></P>
While within the area of effect of this spell, the priest (and only the
priest) gains several special abilities:
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">?</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">His sense of sight is magically enhanced. He can see through normal darkness
and can see invisible creatures and objects. He cannot see through solid
objects, however, and the range of his magical sight is limited to 60 feet.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">?</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The priest has no need for food, water, or rest. He does not feel fatigue and
regenerates 1 hit point per hour spent within the circle. However, he does not
actually rest and therefore cannot regain spells until he sleeps.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">?</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">He is totally immune to the effects of magical and natural fear, as well as <I>sleep</I> and <I>charm</I> spells.
<P></P>
If the priest leaves the circle, the spell is broken. When the spell ends, the
priest must rest for 1 turn per hour (or portion thereof) spent in the circle.
If the priest is forced into action (by being attacked, for example), he can
move at only half his normal movement rate, has an Armor Class penalty of -2, an
attack penalty of -2, and loses all Dexterity combat bonuses.
<P></P>
To cast this spell, the priest must trace a circle of sigils and runes 10 feet
in diameter using a special ink containing the powder of a crushed sapphire
(at least 1,000 gp value) and a drop of holy water. This procedure takes 1 turn
to complete.
