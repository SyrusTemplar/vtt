</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Experience points are earned through the activities of the characters, which
generally relate to their adventuring goals. Thus, all characters on an
adventure receive some experience points for overcoming their enemies or obstacles.
Since group cooperation is important, experience points for defeating foes are
given to all members of the group, regardless of their actions. Who is to say that
the wizard, standing ready with a spell just in case things got ugly, might
not have been necessary? Or that the bard who covered the party's escape route
wasn't doing something important? A character who never hefts a sword may still
have good advice or important suggestions on better tactics. Furthermore, the
wizard and the bard can also learn from the actions of others.
