If the DM wishes to determine the discovery of the following items at random,
he can use the magical item tables on pages 135-139 of the <A HREF="DMG_DD00673.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00673.htm">DUNGEON MASTER Guide</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">. Each item below belongs to a particular table; when a DM's Choice result is
rolled on the appropriate table, the DM can use the indicated item as one of
his options. For instance, the <I>potion of elasticity</I> listed below belongs to Table 89 (page 135, <A HREF="DMG_DD00675.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00675.htm">DMG</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> ). If a 20 is rolled, the DM can use the <I>potion of elasticity</I> as an option for the DM's Choice
<P></P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Potion of Elasticity
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
A character consuming one dose of this potion is able to stretch his legs,
arms, neck, or any other appendage up to a distance in feet equal to twice his
Constitution score; for instance, a character with a Constitution of 15 can
stretch up to 30 feet. A character can stretch only one appendage at a time; for
instance, he can stretch one arm, one finger, or his neck. Whenever he stretches
any appendage, he must make a Constitution Check; if he fails, the stress of the
stretch causes 1d6 hit points of damage. The potion lasts for 1-4 turns; during
this time, the character can make as many stretches as he likes, as long as he
checks for damage for each stretch.

Candle of Everburning
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
This resembles a normal wax candle about 6 inches tall. However, once the
candle is lit, the flame can be extinguished only by the spoken command of whomever
is holding it. Otherwise, the flame continues to burn; it will burn
underwater, in any alternate plane of existence, or in the strongest of winds. <I>Dispel magic</I> and similar spells have no effect on the flame. The <I>candle of everburning</I> can burn for 24 hours before all of its wax melts away.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
These slippers are made of green silk. The magic of the <I>dragon slippers</I> is activated if the wearer concentrates and speaks the word &quot;change.&quot; If
activated, the <I>dragon slippers</I> cause the wearer to appear as a 20-foot dragon with bright yellow scales, a
barbed tail, and long green fangs; the wearer does not gain any of the abilities
of a dragon. While the illusion is in effect, the wearer retains his normal
abilities and statistics. The effect lasts for one hour, but can be canceled any
time by the command of the wearer.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
This 1-foot-square piece of parchment can hold any monster summoned by a<I> monster summoning I</I> spell. The wizard unfolds the parchment and lays it before himself prior to
casting the spell. If the spell is successfully cast, the summoned monster is
immediately absorbed into the parchment, appearing there as a colored image. The
caster can then refold the parchment and carry it with him, holding the
summoned monster indefinitely. When the parchment is unfolded and laid on the ground,
and the wizard speaks a command word, the monster appears, remaining active for
the normal duration of the<I> monster summoning I</I> spell. Any single parchment of monster holding can be used only once; after
the monster is released, the parchment crumbles to dust. The parchment also
crumbles if it is torn or defaced in any way.

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">

This item resembles a small human skull, about 3 inches in diameter, made of
ivory. Once per day, the owner can command the skull to sing. The <I>singing skull</I> sings eerie, depressing tunes for one hour (or less, as ordered by the skull
's owner). All those within 50 feet of the <I>singing skull</I> must make a successful saving throw vs. spells or suffer the effects of a
fear spell. The owner of the <I>singing skull</I> is immune to its effects.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Airboat</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
This appears to be a canoe made of stone and measures 3 feet tall, 12 feet
long, and 4 feet wide. Inside are five evenly spaced stone planks, each capable of
seating two human-sized passengers. A plank on one end of the canoe is marked
with a star symbol in the center. The <I>airboat</I> is also fitted with two sets of stone oars that fit in ridges carved in both
sides of the craft.
<P></P>
The <I>airboat</I> responds to the mental orders of its commander (the character sitting on the
plank with the star symbol). Only a wizard or priest can serve as an <I>airboat</I> commander.
<P></P>
The <I>airboat</I> can move in any direction in any medium. While moving, the <I>airboat</I> is surrounded by an aura of light that allows all of its passengers to
breathe normally, even when traveling through water or airless space. The aura
surrounds the craft to a distance of 10 feet.
<P></P>
The <I>airboat</I> has a movement rate of 40. It can move only if it is being rowed with at
least one set of the stone oars. If only one set is used, the craft has a maximum
movement rate of 20; if both sets are used, the craft has a maximum speed of 40.
A single character can operate two oars, or two characters can sit side by
side on a plank, each operating an oar. To move at maximum speed, the rowers must
complete a stroke every two seconds; if the stroking rate is less than this,
the maximum speed decreases proportionately. For instance, if one set of oars is
stroking once every four seconds, the <I>airboat</I> has a maximum movement rate of 10.
<P></P>
The commander must remain seated on the star plank. He can take no actions
other than commanding the craft. If he moves from his seat, attempts to operate
the oars, or takes any other action, the <I>airboat</I> stops moving. Similarly, if his concentration is interruped, the craft stops.
If it stops moving while in the air, it hovers in place. The <I>airboat</I> can hover in place for only 1 turn, after which it sinks gently to the
ground. If it stops moving while on water, the boat simply drifts.

breath.

<P></P>
This resembles an ordinary traveling spell book, except that it can be folded
over and over until it is a square one inch on each side. The book can be
unfolded when its owner wishes to consult it, then folded back into its small size
for easy carrying.

<P></P>
<P></P>
This coral bracelet enables the wearer to control water-dwelling creatures
with animal intelligence or lower (mainly fishes and reptiles). The creatures must
be within a half-mile radius of the caster in order to be controlled, and they
must be within 30 feet of each other. The number of creatures that can be
affected is a function of Hit Dice. The spell affects 1-10 Hit Dice of monsters.
Monsters with 5+3 Hit Dice or more are unaffected.
<P></P>
The center of the area of effect is determined by the spellcaster. The
creatures with the fewest Hit Dice are affected first, and partial effects are
ignored. The caster does not have to be in the water to command the creatures.
<P></P>
This control lasts for 2-12 (2d6) turns and cannot be dispelled. No saving
throw is allowed against the magic of the<I> bracelet</I>. The wearer can use this ability once per week.
