<P></P>
   A paladin has complete immunity to all forms of organic disease. This immunity
includes diseases from rat, otyugh, and neo-otyugh bites, as well as nonlethal
but disabling maladies like measles and earaches. A paladin never catches a
cold or suffers from tooth decay, and is unaffected by parasitic monsters such as
green slime, violet fungi, gas spores, phycomids, and rot grubs. His wounds
never become infected. The process occurs instantly, automatically, and
painlessly; the paladin isn't even aware of exposure to a disease.
<P></P>
   A paladin's disease resistance is divinely given and can't be transferred to
another character. A magical blood transfusion, for instance, would not grant
disease immunity to the recipient. Nor are a paladin's progeny automatically
immune to diseases, unless they become paladins themselves.
<P></P>
   A paladin experiences the normal consequences of the following:
<P></P>
   <B>Physical trauma</B>. All wounds inflict normal damage. A paladin is as susceptible to
concussions, broken limbs, and exhaustion as any other character, and also suffers the
normal effects of extreme temperature, such as sunburn, heatstroke, and frostbite.
<P></P>
   <B>Poison</B>. A paladin is vulnerable to nearly all types of ingested, injected, and
inhaled toxins. These include irritants (acids, mercury), organic toxins (poison
mushrooms, snake venom, crystal ooze), nerve poisons (belladonna, arsenic), and
poisonous gases (vapors that stop the heart or inhibit breathing). The paladin
can become intoxicated by drinking too much alcohol, and may experience allergic
reactions to pollen, dust, or other substances, but does not suffer from
virus-based or bacteria-based toxins, such as the saliva of a rabid dog or bat.
<P></P>
   <B>Curses and magical diseases</B>. Lycanthropy, mummy rot, and similar afflictions are curses and not diseases.
A paladin suffers the normal effects. (See the <I>PH</I>, <A HREF="PHB_DD01464.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01464.htm">page 27</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, and the <I>DMG</I>, <A HREF="DMG_DD00658.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00658.htm">page 131</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, for details.)
<P></P>
   Note that paladins are immune to the <I>cause disease</I> spell. The DM may decide that very powerful diseases, like mummy rot, may
override the paladin's natural immunity, but could be cured by the paladin's <I>cure disease</I> ability.
<P></P>
   <B>Effects of aging</B>. A paladin ages at the normal human rate. Age brings the ability penalties
given on <A HREF="PHB_DD01455.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01455.htm">Table 12</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, Chapter 1 of the <I>PH</I>, and also the normal debilitations associated with aging. For instance, even
though the paladin's teeth resist bacterial decay, they may still fall out as a
result of enamel erosion. A paladin whose body wears out dies, at the same age
as a normal human.
<P></P>
   <B>Psychological disorders</B>. A paladin is as prone as anyone else to hallucinations, nightmares, memory
loss, insanity, and similar mental and emotional disorders, providing the
disorder isn't a consequence of a disease (such as a fever-induced delirium).
