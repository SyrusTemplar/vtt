<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Quiver of Ehlonna:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This appears to be a typical arrow container capable of holding about 20
arrows. It has an aura of alteration if magic is detected for, and examination shows
that it has three distinct portions. The first and smallest one can contain up
to 60 objects of the same general size and shape as long bow arrows. The
second, slightly longer, compartment will hold up to 18 objects of the same general
size and shape as a javelin. The third and longest portion of the case will
contain as many as six objects of the same general size and shape as a bow—spears
or staves, for example. Such a quiver is always found empty, but once the owner
has filled it, he can command the quiver to produce any stored items he wishes
each round.
