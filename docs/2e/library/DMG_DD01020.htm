<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Phylactery of Long Years:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This device slows the aging process by one-quarter for as long as the priest
wears it. The reduction applies even to magical aging. Thus, if a priest dons
the phylactery at age 20, he will age nine months in every 12 that pass; in 12
chronological years, he will have aged just nine years, and will be 29
(physically) rather than 32. One in 20 of these devices is cursed to operate in reverse.
