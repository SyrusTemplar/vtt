?? As forgatherings are primarily intended as social events, rarely are there
fixed agendas or schedules. Activities tend to develop spontaneously, continue as
long as the rangers show an interest, and end when the participants have had
enough. Following are a few of the activities and events most likely to occur:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Trading</B>.
<P></P>
Trading goes on virtually non-stop at most forgatherings, ranging from private
transactions between individuals to dozens of rangers peddling their wares in
what amounts to an open air market. Merchandise includes both the common (rope,
saddles, boots) and the unusual (chainlink leashes, camouflage paint, homemade
wine). Weapons and maps are especially in demand, particularly bows and
quarterstaves with hand-carved designs, and maps of exotic territories that detail
the newest trails. Rangers pay for their purchases in fur, food, and trinkets as
well as gold pieces.
<P></P>
?? Magical items are occasionally available, but many rangers are more inclined
to loan them to needy comrades rather than sell them outright. Rangers who
borrow magical items are expected to return them at the next forgathering. Being men
and women of integrity, the borrowers rarely fail to honor their agreements.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>News and Gossip.
<P></P>
</B> Information flows freely at forgatherings, and most rangers are eager to learn
about the trials and tribulations their comrades have experienced in the
previous year. They hear of marriages, births, and deaths, as well as followers
acquired and abandoned. They learn which expeditions resulted in new discoveries
and which ended in disaster. Rumors abound of lost civilizations, hidden
treasures, and gruesome monsters. An attentive ranger may hear about employment
opportunities or new hunting grounds. If he's lucky, an unattached ranger may make
contact with a potential mate.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Training.
<P></P>
</B> The typical forgathering attracts rangers with a wide range of skills. Often,
they're willing to give instruction to novices for a small fee or as a gesture
of friendship. If he locates a willing teacher, a ranger may be able to pick up
hunting or tracking tips, acquire cooking secrets from a master chef, or learn
how to construct emergency shelters from an elder woodsman. (The optional
training rules in Chapter 8 of the <I>DUNGEON MASTER Guide</I> can be used to allow rangers to acquire new skills as a result of their
forgathering experiences.)
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Contests.
<P></P>
</B> No forgathering would be complete without games and contests for rangers to
demonstrate their skills and compete for prizes. Conservative forgatherings
feature debates, target shooting, and knotting matches (where contestants see who
can untangle complex knots in the shortest time). The Glass Eye Concourse and
similarly rowdy forgatherings feature contests of a more physical nature, such as
head-slamming (contestants butt heads as hard as they can until one passes
out), dagger juggling (often done blindfolded), and bear wrestling.
<P></P>
?? Mountain Men in particular have a tradition of rather intense competition. For
example, Mountain Men enjoy a bizarre drinking contest where bitter roots,
fish scales, rotten vegetables, and other distasteful substances are mixed with
water; whoever consumes the most of this vile brew is declared the winner.
<P></P>
?? Other contests common to forgatherings include horse races, rabbit hunts, and
mock battles using swords and spears bound with thick layers of cloth. Winners
are awarded silver pendants, hiking boots, or other prizes donated by the more
affluent attendees. If donations aren't available, each participant puts a few
coins in a pot before a contest begins; whoever wins claims the pot. Wagering
is rampant for all types of contests, with rangers betting everything from
animal pelts and dried meat, to arrowheads and leather gloves.
