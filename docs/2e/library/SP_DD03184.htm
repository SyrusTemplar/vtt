The puttering, scientifically-minded wizard who enjoys working with various
material components is likely to find the School of Alchemy to be a welcome
source of inspiration and magical might. Alchemists are inventors and experimenters,
always striving for a way to create new and greater effects through the use of
magical powders, reagents, and potions.
<P></P>
The exact nature of the alchemist's materials is not very important for game
play, although it is good role-playing for a player to note which substances and
minerals are vital to his character's spells. Unlike most wizards, who define
the world by the four classic elements of earth, air, fire, and water, the
alchemist believes that each subtle combination of these elements is a new element
of its own. Gold may be nothing more than a rare type of earth with a small
glimmer of fire in it, but the alchemist considers the properties of gold as a
unique substance with no other components. In other words, alchemists describe
their world in the modern terms of a Periodic Table of Elements, even though
notions such as atoms, electrons, or atomic weight have no meaning in their universe.
<P></P>
As scientific characters, alchemists will always maintain a large and
well-equipped laboratory to pursue their experiments. The laboratory must be
well-stocked with all kinds of materials, including samples of every metal or alloy
imaginable, equipment such as burners, beakers and bottles, and natural curiosities
like magnets, incendiaries, and other such things. An alchemist is assumed to
begin play with an appropriate laboratory in his home town or base of
operations, but building and outfitting a new laboratory costs at least 1,000 gp per
character level, and existing laboratories require at least 50 gp of materials a
level per month to be functional. An alchemist without access to his laboratory
loses the bonus alchemy spell he could normally memorize at each spell level,
and can-t conduct research, make potions, or add new spells to his spellbook.
<P></P>
Alchemists have no modifiers to their saving throws or their victims? saving
throws, but instead they have the special ability to create potions, starting at
6th level. The alchemist must first research the potion's formula, as if
conducting normal spell research; consider the potion's level to be equal to its XP
value divided by 100, so a <I>potion of clairaudience</I> (XP value 250) is considered a 3rd-level spell, and a <I>potion of longevity</I> (XP value 500) is a 5th-level spell. The research time is two weeks per
effective level, and the cost is 500 gp per effective level. The alchemist must pass
a learn spells check to successfully research the formula. Just like spells,
the number of potion formulae the alchemist can ever understand is limited by
his Intelligence score Maximum Number of Spells per Level, except that all
potions are counted together for this purpose. A character with an Intelligence of 12
can never know how to make more than seven types of potions.
<P></P>
Once an alchemist knows the potion's formula, he can produce one dose by
investing in 300?1800 gp worth of materials and spending one uninterrupted week in
his laboratory. Again, a learn spells roll applies to see if he followed the
directions carefully, or if he ruined the batch instead. If the DM finds that a
player is abusing this ability, he can insist on specific adventures to acquire
rare and unusual materials such as a griffon's heart, a beholder's eye, and
other such hard-to-get items.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>The School of Alchemy:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The school of alchemy is opposed by the Schools of Illusion/Phantasm (things
that aren-t real are of no interest to alchemists) and Necromancy (similarly,
life forces and spirits are too intangible for alchemy.) All the spells in the
school of alchemy are considered to have no verbal component when employed by an
alchemist, which means that an alchemist has little to fear from a silence
spell or any other magic that prevents speaking. The School of Alchemy consists of
the following spells; italicized spells appear in the<I> Tome of Magic</I>.
