<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Rod of Splendor:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The possessor of this rod is automatically and continually bestowed with a
Charisma of 18 for as long as the item is held or carried. Whatever garments the
possessor wears (including armor) appear to be of the finest quality and
condition, although no special magical benefit (such as a change in Armor Class) is
enjoyed.
<P></P>
If the possessor already has a Charisma score of 18 or greater, the rod does
not further enhance this attribute. When the possessor expends one charge, the
rod actually creates and garbs him in clothing of the finest fabrics, plus
adornments of furs and jewels.
<P></P>
Apparel created by the magic of the rod remains in existence unless the
possessor attempts to sell any part of it, or if any of the garb is forcibly taken
from. In either of these cases, all of the apparel immediately disappears. The
garments may be freely given to other characters or creatures, however, and will
remain whole and sound afterward. Characters bedecked in a magically created
outfit can't replace or add garments by expending another charge-if the possessor
tries this, the charge is simply wasted.
<P></P>
The value of any noble garb created by the wand will be from 7,000 to 10,000
gp (1d4+6). The fabric will be worth 1,000 gp, furs 5,000 gp, and jewel trim
from 1,000 to 4,000 gp (i.e., 10 gems of 100 gp value each, 10 gems of 200 gp
value each or 20 gems of 100 gp value, and so forth).
<P></P>
The second special power of the rod, also requiring one charge to bring about,
is the creation of a palatial tent-a huge pavilion of silk encompassing
between 1,500 and 3,000 square feet. Inside the tent are temporary furnishings and
food suitable to the splendor of the pavilion and in sufficient supply to
entertain as many as 100 persons.
<P></P>
The tent and its trappings will last for one day. At the end of that time, the
pavilion may be maintained by expending another charge. If the extra charge
isn't spent, the tent and all objects associated with it (including any items
that were taken out of the tent) disappear.
<P></P>
This rod cannot be recharged.
