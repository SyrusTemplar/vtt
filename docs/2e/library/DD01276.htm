</B>Daily Recovery of Spells</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Wizards and priests cannot simply stop anywhere and regain spells they have
cast or change the spells they have memorized. Memorizing a spell is a
difficult task that requires a clear head from a good night's sleep and 10 minutes of
effort per level of the spell (see the<I> <A HREF="PHB_DD01652.htm"></A></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="PHB_DD01652.htm">Player's Handbook</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, Chapter 7). Memorizing a spell is an arduous mental task, and it is helpful
to consider exactly what a character must do to accomplish it.
<P></P>
The basic requirement to memorize spells is a good night's sleep. The
character must awake feeling fresh and rested. The DM must decide if a character is
rested well enough to regain spells, but about eight hours spent in reasonable
comfort-one cannot regain spells after a night spent in a saddle-is the minimum.
<P></P>
The spellcaster must also have enough peace, quiet, and comfort to allow
proper concentration on the character's studies or devotions. Spellcasters do not
necessarily have to be sitting in the lap of luxury to regain spells, but their
minds must be free from overt distractions, such as combat raging nearby,
exposure to inclement weather, or fatigue. Of course, wizards need plenty of light to
read their spellbooks by.
<P></P>
Priests don-t use spellbooks but must have all the trappings required for
solemn prayer and meditation. Such trappings include some token of the deity being
petitioned for spells, such as a holy symbol, or perhaps prayer at a site that
reflects the deity's nature-petitioning a war deity from an ancient battlefield
is going to get the deity's attention.
<P></P>
Characters who do not require sleep (due to a magical item, racial ability, or
other special circumstance) can acquire spells only once each day and only
after eight hours of restful calm; the spellcaster cannot acquire spells
immediately after movement, combat, spellcasting, or other distractions.
<P></P>
If a character is disturbed while studying or praying for a spell (by combat,
injury, loud noise, or other distraction), the caster must begin work on the
spell again and any time already spent on the spell is lost. For example, Rozmare
is poring over her spell books to memorize a <I>fly </I>spell. She is seated in a forest glade where her party has spent the night.
The sun is shining and the forest is fairly quiet, so all Rozmare needs to do is
study her books for 30 minutes to memorize the spell. Unfortunately, after
Rozmare has been studying for 20 minutes, the local pixies decide to play a prank,
pitting Rozmare and her companions against an illusory band of goblin acrobats.
When the confusion finally dies down, Rozmare has to begin studying her <I>fly</I> spell all over again, requiring another 30 minutes of uninterrupted study.

spellcaster can spend a maximum of eight hours a day acquiring spells. After that
much effort, the character can no longer concentrate sufficiently to regain any
spells, though the character suffers no other disadvantages.
