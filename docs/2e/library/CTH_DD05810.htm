<I>Description:</I> Circumstances have reduced some unfortunates to such a level of poverty and
helplessness that the only possible way that they can survive is by imploring
their fellow beings to give them whatever meager scraps can be spared. At least,
so the Beggar would wish it to appear.
<P></P>
For a great many Beggars this is the truth; misfortune or disability have
dealt them sore blows, and they must rely on the charity of individuals and a few
institutions, such as beneficent churches, for subsistence.
<P></P>
But there is another class of Beggar, which is really a particularly insidious
variety of swindler or con artist. This character is usually perfectly
able-bodied, but has taken up begging as a career, supplemented by minor theft
(pickpocketing and the like) and the gathering and selling of information to
interested parties. It is with this sort of Beggar that this kit is chiefly concerned.
<P></P>
The Beggar has no requirements beyond those of the thief class.
<P></P>
<I>Role:</I> Thieves of this kit, professional Beggars, were usually raised into their
role. This of course means a lower (indeed, lowest in many places!) class
background, and meager financial resources at best. The Beggar has other resources,
however: connections, street smarts, a sharp eye, and diverse skills for cajoling
passers-by out of their spare cash.
<P></P>
Effective begging requires consummate skills of acting and disguise, so that
the Beggar can present himself in the manner most likely to garner the sympathy
and cash of the people he accosts.
<P></P>
As a matter of survival, the Beggar needs diverse sources of income. Few can
avoid starvation solely by the charity of strangers in the street. They are also
dealers in gossip and information (such as the movement and activities of
wealthy personages), with ears ever open for any tidbit of knowledge that may help
fill their stomachs with food. Beggars will also gladly hire themselves out as
messengers or spies.
<P></P>
Beggars also are known to cooperate with other varieties of thieves,
especially Cutpurses. A favorite ruse is for one or more Beggars to accost a
wealthy-looking person. While they distract him with their pitiful (and more often than
not, futile) pleas for assistance, a slick Cutpurse relieves the victim of his
purse. Shares of the score are divided among Beggars and Cutpurse.
<P></P>
Many Beggars are affiliates of the local thieves' guild, surprisingly enough.
The guild makes use of them as messengers and informants. It also may have a
sort of protection racket going with them: Beggars must share their score with
the local guild in exchange for protection from thieves of the guild itself, as
well as &quot;freelancers&quot; and rival guildsmen. Guild-affiliated Beggars also may
gain some measure of protection from the local constabulary—a useful thing if
local law prohibits panhandling.
<P></P>
<I>Secondary Skills: Usually</I> (90%) none; begging itself is assumed to have been the character's trade or
profession. If a Beggar does have any secondary skills, it should be assumed
that for some reason or other he lost his means of employment. He may have been
thrown out of his trade guild, for instance; or could have been maimed so that he
could no longer perform tasks as he did in the past.
<P></P>
<I>Weapon Proficiencies:</I> Beggars begin with familiarity only with simple, inexpensive weapons. The
knife is a favorite, being inexpensive, easy to use, and easy to conceal.
Beginning thieves with the Beggar kit should select their two proficient weapons from
among the following: club, dagger, dart, knife, sling, or staff.
<P></P>
<I> Nonweapon Proficiencies:</I> Required: Begging, Disguise, Information Gathering, Observation. Recommended:
Alertness, Singing, Trailing. As mentioned under Secondary Skills, above, a
Beggar with marketable skills (e.g., crafts or trades) should have some reason in
his background why he is no longer able to support himself through them.
<P></P>
<I>Skill Progression:</I> Beggars become most proficient in picking pockets (to supplement begging
income), and moving silently, hiding in shadows, and detecting noise (useful for
gathering information and tailing people). They tend to be worst at opening locks
and finding or removing traps, since these skills require technical training
that is not easily available.
<P></P>
<I>Equipment:</I> The basic equipment of a Beggar is a wooden bowl or cup in which passers-by
may place alms. More sophisticated Beggars have false crutches, make-up and the
like to make themselves seem as desperate and poverty-stricken as possible.
<P></P>
Some Beggars have children with them (rented from the true parents, or
borrowed in return for a share of the day's income, if they are not the Beggar's own)
to arouse still more sympathy.
<P></P>
A more sophisticated sort of Beggar offers a service of some kind—singing a
song, or playing a simple instrument—in exchange for food, drink, or a few coins.
<P></P>
Few Beggars can afford to purchase armor; and even if they could, they would
not want to wear it, since it would suggest that they are wealthier than they
would like to appear.
<P></P>
Beggars who rise above their circumstances may of course equip themselves as
they see fit, although then they will no longer be accepted by other Beggars as
one of their kind. A Beggar who appears well-off could suffer penalties, at the
DM's discretion, at the following proficiencies: begging (because the
character doesn't look impoverished), information gathering (because other Beggars will
distrust him), and even trailing (because the thief might not blend in as well
with the city's masses).
<P></P>
<I>Special Benefits:</I> The most valuable benefits of the Beggar kit are the large number of bonus
nonweapon proficiencies. These should be granted to a character even if the
campaign at large does not make use of nonweapon proficiency rules.
<P></P>
<I>Special Hindrances:</I> Beggars are scorned by most of society. Even characters who share their
wealth with Beggars tend to feel a sort of disgust or condescension, though they may
try to hide it. Other thieves, however, recognize the talents and value of
Beggars. For this reason, Beggars suffer -2 on reaction rolls with NPCs who aren't
thieves.
<P></P>
Furthermore, because of their impoverished background, Beggars start the game
with only 3d4 gold pieces.
<P></P>
<I>Races:</I> Beggars may be of any race. In regions with a lot of bigotry, where
demihumans have difficulty finding legitimate employment, Beggars are commonly
demihuman. Most nonhuman Beggars were forced into their position by unfortunate
circumstances—they were not born into it.
