Wizards must be at least 20th level and have Intelligence scores of 18 or
higher. Priests must be at least 20th level and have Wisdom scores of 18 or higher.
Only characters with this level of experience and mental capacity understand
the processes involved in creating a true dweomer.
<P></P>
Wizards can cast any true dweomer that uses schools available to the character
(<A HREF="DD01324.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01324.htm">Table 28</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> lists spell types by school). Priests can cast true dweomers that use any
school, but the spells they create must produce effects that reflect their deity?s
portfolio or sphere of control.

Although a true dweomer is not actually memorized the way a standard spell is,
the process of preparing and casting one is taxing. No mortal can prepare,
cast, or have ready to cast more than four true dweomers in a single day, and most
characters cannot manage that many (see <A HREF="DD01373.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01373.htm">Table 44</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, page 157). When characters reach their limits, their minds are too drained
and befuddled to attempt any more true dweomers, though they are free to pursue
any other activities they are normally able to undertake.
