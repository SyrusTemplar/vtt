This method has all the benefits of methods II and III. Few, if any,
characters are likely to have poor scores. Most scores are above average. The individual
score ranges are still not excessively high, so truly exceptional characters
are still very rare. However, the majority of characters are significantly above
the norm.

different number combinations with the requirements of different races and classes.
New players easily can be overwhelmed by the large number of choices during
this process. The examples below are arranged for fighters.
