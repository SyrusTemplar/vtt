Rangers gain their spell powers somewhat faster than paladins do, but in the
long run they-re less formidable as spellcasters; paladins are more powerful.
Rangers have more in common with druids or shamans than other varieties of
priests and may only learn spells of the plant or animal spheres (unless the
character has been customized using the rules presented in <A HREF="DD03434.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03434.htm">Chapter 3</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> ). The ranger-s spell point progression appears in <A HREF="DD03550.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03550.htm">Table 35</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Ranger Spell Point Progression.
<P></P>
Just like paladins, rangers begin with the spellcasting ability of a 1st-level
character and reach their maximum casting level of 9 when they reach 16th
level. They are limited to spells of 3rd level or less and are also limited in the
maximum number of spells of each level they may memorize at one time. Rangers
pay the same number of spell points to memorize spells as paladins do.
<P></P>
Rangers normally use the same system of magic that druids or shamans use in
the campaign. This could include preserving, channelling, or conditional magic,
at the DM-s discretion. Rangers reach their maximum spell ability at 16th level
and do not gain more spell points at higher levels.
