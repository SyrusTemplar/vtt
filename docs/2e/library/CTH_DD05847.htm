There are certain obvious core activities of thieves which will always be a
staple of guild goings-on, but there are also more uncommon activities which not
all guilds will have dealings with. Looking at the range of possible guild
activities is done here for two reasons. First, it is a useful precursor to guild
design, to come later. Second, it is a natural lead-in to the issue of relations
which exist between thieves' guilds and other groups. Since these are often
based on mutual interests and spheres of activity, it makes sense to consider
these interests and activities first, to make sense of the associations to be
reviewed later!
<P></P>
Importantly, the activities reviewed here do not involve all the thieves of
the Guild. If PC Guildmembers find some activities run by a guild objectionable
(e.g., because they are good-aligned), they shouldn't be forced to do so. The
idea here is simply to give an idea of the range of activities which guilds may
be involved with on more than an occasional basis.

<B>Core Activities

These are the bread-and-butter activities of thieves. Virtually any guild will
have these as everyday activities. That is, guild members will regularly
indulge in them and they will provide much of the &quot;bread and butter&quot; income for most
thieves (especially lower-level thieves).

Pickpocketing, burglary, robbery, street theft, street gambling, and mugging
are the most obvious core activities. There's little need to say much more about
them here. Almost all players will have had their thieves indulge in such
behaviors, and will be familiar with them. Standard AD&amp;DÂ® game rules, and many
equipment items and Thief Kits presented in this volume, give exhaustive detail
about them.

The DM can look upon the listing here as a menu from which choices can be made
later on when designing a thieves' guild. The list isn't exhaustive; devious
DMs can no doubt add to it for unusual guilds in a campaign setting. The
activities here are ones which will involve the guild as a body, or many of its
members, on a systematic basis. In turn, this will affect the nature of the guild
significantly. Obviously, many of the activities listed below may involve
specialists, and the thieves' kits outlined earlier can be very useful in many cases.
