<I>Geraldor slipped through the alley, his black cloak masking his progress
through the filthy passage. Reassuring himself that he was not pursued, he stepped
boldly onto the Golden Way. With a nervous gesture he smoothed his oily black
hair and attempted to stroke his wispy mustache.
<P></P>
Sighing, Geraldor realized that any attempt to look like a gentleman was
doomed to failure. He hoped his guildmaster's plan was intact.
<P></P>
And there before him was the Highgate! Geraldor's heart pounded as he examined
the brawny men at arms, four in number, manning the post. As the only public
route into the city's Golden Quarter—home of all the wealthiest merchants, most
powerful lords, and influential ambassadors in all the land—the Highgate was
usually guarded well.
<P></P>
But not tonight. Geraldor recognized the giant, hulking form of Morto,
sergeant-at-arms of the city watch. As Geraldor had expected—nay, hoped—Morto
commanded the detachment at the Highgate.
<P></P>
With a barely concealed nod of recognition, Geraldor stalked to the gate and
stood impatiently as Morto made a pretense of examining his &quot;pass.&quot; In reality,
this crudely forged slip would fool no one with any capacity for comprehending
script.
<P></P>
But Morto's reading ability was not the issue tonight. Instead, the guard's
loyalty to the guildmaster was the force behind Morto's curt nod and his gesture
ushering Geraldor through the Highgate. Geraldor fairly skipped through the
great stone arch. He had entered the Golden Quarter!
<P></P>
Now his movements took on the shadowy aspect of the master thief at work.
Though he remained alert, he knew that the major obstacle had been passed at the
gate. The hefty bribes offered to Morto and his associates had paved the way to
riches. It only remained for Geraldor to haul those riches away.
<P></P>
The wiry thief found the mansion that had been selected by the guildmaster.
Family and servants all slept, and they had no dog. In a matter of minutes
Geraldor had collected the lady's gems. He spent several more minutes seeking the
strongbox, finally discovering it in a small, luxurious sitting room. He picked
the lock and pulled out only the most valuable coinage, platinum and gold, before
soundlessly slipping toward the exit.
<P></P>
In the house he saw magnificent silver candelabra, a huge and obviously
enchanted sword, and other wonders. All of these he disdained as too bulky for his
current mission. After all, Geraldor was a professional!
<P></P>
Scarcely suppressing an urge to whistle, Geraldor sauntered back along the
Golden Way. He would pass through the Highgate again and immediately disappear
into the clustered neighborhoods that crowded both banks of the muddy river.
<P></P>
He saw Morto at the guardpost and nodded casually, passing under the great
stone arch again on his way out of the Golden Quarter. Only then did he notice
something wrong: Morto stood mute, with his hands shackled before him.
<P></P>
At that same instant a heavy gauntlet fell upon Geraldor's shoulder and a
massive arm propelled him into the stone wall of the gatehouse.
<P></P>
&quot;What have we here?&quot; growled an unfamiliar voice. Terrified, Geraldor saw that
it issued from beneath the shiny cap of a watch captain.
<P></P>
&quot;J-just going home, m-my lord!&quot; he stammered, wriggling in a futile attempt to
break away.
<P></P>
The captain laughed, having already found and discarded Geraldor's fake pass.
The man's gloved hands continued to poke through Geraldor's clothes and
pouches, retrieving object after object, often with a low chuckle.
<P></P>
&quot;The lady Allorana's diadem, I see—perhaps she loaned it to you!&quot; The captain
roared with hilarity, joined by the guffaws of a full company of guardsmen that
Geraldor now saw in the shadows.
<P></P>
Then the captain's voice lowered as his hand tightened around Geraldor's
throat. &quot;Now, thief, you will find out what the laws are in our town. And you will
have time to learn them while you rot in gaol!&quot;
<P></P>

<P></P>
From even before the time, thousands of years ago, when the Code of Hammurabi
first defined the legal system of a body of government, and extending to the
present day, societies have created procedures for defining personal possessions.
An inherent part of this definition includes the penalties due those who
violate these procedures. Odd as it may sound, thieves cannot exist without some
kind of legal framework.
<P></P>
And from the time in any culture when personal possessions come into being,
there have been those who seek to remove the possessions of others and make them
their own. It is for players of characters who attempt this perilous exchange
of wealth, and to their Dungeon Masters, that this tome is intended.
<P></P>
Of course, some thievery occurs under the guise of authority, and as such
falls beyond the scope of this book. Tax collectors, for example, may steal from
those who regard such claims as thievery. So do conquerors. But these are not
AD&amp;D® thieves. While they may approach the category of bandits, their &quot;theft&quot;
demands more fighting skill and aggression than stealth.
<P></P>
By far the more common type of thievery, and the one that generally comes to
mind when discussing the character type, is the furtive pilfering described in
the incident above. Poor Geraldor has suffered the fate known to many of these
wrongdoers as he is taken by the long arm of the law. But if that law did not
exist, then Geraldor's task would become meaningless.
<P></P>
This point is one that should be well remembered by those who play thieves as
well as those who run the campaigns. Regardless of how chaotic the setting, a
structure at least vaguely approximating a legal system is necessary before the
thief can really begin to ply his trade.
