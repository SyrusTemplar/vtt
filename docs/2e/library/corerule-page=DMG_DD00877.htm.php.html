<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Bag of Devouring:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This bag appears to be an ordinary sack—possibly appearing to be empty,
possibly holding beans. The sack is, however, the lure used by an extradimensional
creature—this is one of its feeding orifices.
<P></P>
Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject to &quot;swallowing'' if it
is thrust within the bag. The <I>bag of devouring</I> is 90% likely to ignore any initial intrusions, but any time it senses living
human flesh within, it is 60% likely to close and attempt to draw the whole
victim in—base 75% chance for success, less Strength bonus for &quot;damage,'' and
each +1 = -5% on base chance. Thus, an 18 Strength character (with +2 damage) is
only 65% likely to be drawn into the bag, while a 5 Strength character (with -1
damage) is 80% likely to be drawn in.
<P></P>
The bag radiates magic. It can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It will act
as a <I>bag of holding</I> (normal capacity), but each turn it has a 5% cumulative chance of
&quot;swallowing'' the contents and then &quot;spitting the stuff out&quot; in some non-space. Creatures
drawn within are consumed in one round, eaten, and gone forever.
