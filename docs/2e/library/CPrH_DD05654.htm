Another effect of the fact that priests are servants of their gods is this:
The god doesn't have to give his priest the spells the priest wants.
<P></P>
In most situations, when the priest prays for his spells, he gets the ones he
desires. But if the god and DM wish, he could get different spells on some
occasions.
<P></P>
There are two usual causes for this to happen:
<P></P>
If the god is displeased with the priest for some minor infraction, he might
give the priest spells which dictate the priests' actions for the day. A
fighting-priest might emerge from his meditation with only healing spells on hand, for
instance, a clear sign that the god wants him to act in a supporting role
today.
<P></P>
Or, if the god knows of a specific opponent that the priest will be fighting
today, he might give the priest spells appropriate to defeating that enemy.
<P></P>
In neither case will the god send a telegram explaining why he's done what
he's done. The priest has to accept what the god hands him that day, and has to do
so without knowing why.
