<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wand of Flame Extinguishing:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This sort of wand has three separate functions:
<P></P>
Nonmagical fires of normal size can be extinguished without using any charges.
Normal size includes anything up to the size of a bonfire or a fire in a
regular fireplace?equal to four to six billets of wood burning hotly.
<P></P>
To extinguish large, nonmagical fires, flaming oil in quantity equal to a
gallon or more, the fire produced by a fiend, a <I>flame tongue</I> sword, or a <I>burning hands</I> spell, one charge is expended from the wand. Continual magical flames, such
as those of a sword or a creature able to ignite, will be extinguished for six
rounds and will flare up again after that time.
<P></P>
When applied to large magical fires such as those caused by <I>fireball, flame strike,</I> or <I>wall of fire</I> spells, two charges are expended from the wand as the flames are extinguished.
<P></P>
If the device is used upon a creature composed of flame (a fire elemental, for
instance), a successful attack roll inflicts 6d6 points of damage upon the
creature.
