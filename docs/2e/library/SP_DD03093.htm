<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Artistic Ability:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The character has talent with the use of brushes and paint, charcoal
sketching, and the sculptor’s knife. Even without any related proficiency the character
can render realistic maps and mold simple objects from clay. When this trait
is coupled with training, the character can create works of real artistic merit.
Whether these have worth in monetary terms or as relating to the character’s
status in the campaign world are circumstances that must be adjudicated by the
DM. As a general rule, the character’s work as a potter, tailor, weaver,
painter, blacksmith, leather worker, or sculptor will fetch 1–50% more than the
typical cost for such products.
