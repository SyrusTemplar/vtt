<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> As important as fighting is to the AD&amp;D game, it isn't the be-all and end-all
of play. It's just one way for characters to deal with situations. If
characters could do nothing but fight, the game would quickly get boring--every
encounter would be the same. Because there is more to the game than fighting, we'll
cover much more than simple hack-and-slash combat in this chapter.

In addition to explaining the basic mechanics of hitting and missing, there
are rules here for turning undead, special ways to attack and defend, poison,
heroic feats, and more.
