Tenser's transformation is a sight guaranteed to astound any creature not
aware of its power, for when the wizard casts the spell, he undergoes a startling
transformation. The size and strength of the wizard increase to heroic
proportions, so he becomes a formidable fighting machine; the spell causes the caster to
become a berserk fighter! The wizard's hit points double, and all damage he
sustains comes first from the magical points gained; once these points are
eliminated, all subsequent damage (to his true hit points) is doubled. The Armor
Class of the wizard is 4 better than that possessed prior to casting the spell (AC
10 goes to 6, AC 9 to 5, AC 8 to 4, etc.), to a maximum Armor Class of -10.
<P></P>
All attacks are as a fighter of the same level as the wizard (i.e., the wizard
uses the combat values normally reserved for fighters). The wizard can use
either a dagger or a staff when attacking. A dagger can be used twice per round,
and each successful attack inflicts an additional 2 points of damage. A staff
can be used only once per round, but with a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls.
The wizard fights in melee in preference to all other forms of attack, and
continues attacking until all opponents are slain, he is killed, the magic is
dispelled, or the spell duration expires.

The material component for casting this spell is a <I>potion of heroism</I> (or <I>superheroism</I>) that the wizard must consume during the course of uttering the spell.
