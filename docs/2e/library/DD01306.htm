</B>The Spoils of Victory
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The combatants are free to decide when a duel ends and what happens to the
character who loses the duel, but the general terms must be set in advance. A
magical duel always ends when one combatant runs out of spells or runs out of hit
points; the combatants choose one or both conditions to apply. The combatants
can choose additional conditions for ending the duel, such as when an opponent
reaches half hit points or when an opponent casts a certain type of spell.
Preparing the arena requires an extra turn for each extra condition and two extra
turns if the condition does not apply equally to both opponents.
<P></P>
For example, if Calvin and Delsenora wish to conduct a duel in which the first
character to cast an Evocation spell loses, they need one extra turn to build
the arena. If they wish to end the duel only when Delsenora casts an evocation
spell-leaving Calvin free to use them throughout the duel-they need two extra
turns to complete the arena.
<P></P>
Once conditions for ending the duel are set, the duel automatically ends when
the condition is met, even if the opponents change their minds. A character can
always end a duel early by surrendering and accepting defeat.
<P></P>
The extent of the duel's consequences depends on the combatants? resolve and
how many levels of spells the combatants invest when forming the arena. Some
common terms are listed below:
<P></P>
<A NAME="703bce5d"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="5"><B>
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Friendly Competition: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The spellcasters are more interested in who can win than in harming each
other. There is little risk to either character, but a treacherous opponent could
use the duel to delay his adversary and perhaps gain the upper hand in a future
confrontation.
<P></P>
<I>0?6 Spell Levels: </I>All spells cast during the duel remain in the characters? memories. The
opponents? hit point totals return to normal when the duel ends, though the loser
looks a little worse for the wear.
<P></P>
<I>7?12 Spell Levels: </I>The winner retains all spells cast during the duel, and the winner's hit point
total returns to normal when the duel ends. The loser suffers 2d6 points of
temporary damage and forfeits 2d4 levels of spells.
<P></P>
<I>13?18 Spell Levels: </I>The winner loses 1d6 levels of spells used during the duel. The winner's hit
point total returns to normal when the duel ends. The loser suffers 4d6 points
of temporary damage, which automatically returns an the rate of one hit point
per round, and forfeits 4d4 levels of spells.
<P></P>
<I>19+ Spell Levels: </I>The winner loses 4d6 levels of spells used during the duel. The winner's hit
point total returns to normal when the duel ends. The loser suffers 8d6 points
of temporary damage and loses 8d4 levels of spells.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="5"><B>
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Death: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The opponents intend to inflict harm upon each other. Timid characters might
contribute very few levels of spells to the arena to avoid serious harm.
<P></P>
<I>0?6 Levels of Spells: </I>All spells cast during the duel remain in the characters? memories. The loser
suffers 2d6 points of damage and must save vs. death or die.
<P></P>
<I>7?12 Levels of Spells: </I>The winner loses 1d6 levels of spells cast during the duel. The loser suffers
4d6 points of damage, loses 4d4 levels of spells, and must save vs. death or
die.
<P></P>
<I>13?18 Levels of Spells: </I>The winner loses 2d6 levels of spells cast during the duel and suffers 1d6
points of temporary damage. The loser suffers 6d6 points of damage, loses 8d4
levels of spells, and must save vs. death or die. Even if successful, the character
must pass a system shock roll or fall unconscious for 2d6 turns.
<P></P>
<I>18?22 Levels of Spells: </I>The winner loses 4d6 levels of spells cast during the duel and suffers 2d6
points of temporary damage. A magical explosion envelops the loser, inflicting 8d6
points of damage. The losing character must save vs. breath weapon. If the
save fails, the character dies and all of his equipment must save vs. magical fire
or be destroyed. If the save is successful, the character loses consciousness
for 2d6 turns. In either case, there is 20% chance the character is blown to
another plane. The character also loses 12d4 levels of spells.
<P></P>
<I>23+ Levels of Spells: </I>The winner loses 2d6 levels of spells cast during the duel and suffers 4d6
points of temporary damage. An intense magical explosion envelops the loser and
inflicts 10d6 points of damage. The character must save vs. breath weapon. If the
save fails, the character dies and all his equipment must save vs. lightning
or be destroyed. If successful, the character loses consciousness for 2d6 turns.
In either case, there is a 40% chance that the character is blown to another
plane. The character also loses 18d4 levels of spells.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Service: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The combatants agree to perform some task if they are defeated. The tasks to
be performed can be agreed upon before the duel begins or left to the victor-s
discretion. The duel has the same effects on the combatants as a friendly
competition, with the following additional effects:
<P></P>
<I>0?6 Spell Levels: </I>The loser is charmed (as a charm person spell) by the winner. If a service has
been agreed upon in advance, any orders not related to the task allow the
charmed character a saving throw to negate the spell. If no task has been agreed
upon in advance, the charm functions normally.
<P></P>
<I>7?12 Spell Levels: </I>The loser is charmed as above, and the winner can implant a suggestion (as the
3rd-level wizard spell). If a service has been agreed upon in advance, there
is no saving throw vs. the spell if it pertains to the service. If the loser
resists the suggestion, the charm remains in place.
<P></P>
<I>13?18 Spell Levels: </I>The loser is charmed and subject to suggestion as above, and the winner may
place a geas (as the 6th-level wizard spell) on the loser. If a service has been
agreed upon in advance, there is no saving throw vs. the spell if it pertains
to the service. Resisting the geas has no effect on the charm or the suggestion.
<P></P>
<I>19+ Spell Levels: </I>The loser falls completely under the winner's will and can be dominated (as
the 5th level wizard spell domination). If the domination is broken, the winner
can immediately geas the loser. The winner is free to issue any commands he
wishes within the limits of the domination and geas spells. Even if a service has
been agreed upon in advance, the winner may alter the deal. The geas can be
lifted only by a wish, dispel magic, or remove curse spell cast by a character of
higher level than the winner.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Prize: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The combatants are vying to possess some tangible object. In most cases, the
character monitoring the duel holds the object and presents it to the winner.
The duel itself can be fought to the death, for service (particularly useful if
the item being fought over is not present at the dueling site), or can be
friendly.
<P></P>
<A NAME="f5e0e182"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="5"><B>
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Spell Loss: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Spells lost after a duel are gone from the character's memory as though cast
normally. Spells contributed to the arena are always lost. If a character loses
a random number of spell levels, he must lose as many spells form memory as are
required to meet the total.
<P></P>
For example, Delsenora loses a friendly contest to Calvin. She loses the <I>fireball</I> spell she contributed to the arena and the die roll indicates she must lose
four more levels of spells. Delsenora chooses spells from her list of memorized
spells to meet the requirement; she can lose four 1st-level spells, two
2nd-level spells, or any other combination of spells that equals or exceeds four
levels.
<P></P>
When a character loses spells after a duel, any material components required
to cast the spells are consumed, but the character can regain the spells
normally.
<P></P>
The winner cannot lose more levels of spells than were cast during the duel,
but the loser can. If a character loses more levels of spells than were
memorized before the duel, he loses one point of Intelligence/Reason (if a wizard) or
one point of Wisdom/Intuition (if a priest) for each excess level lost. The loss
is permanent if the duel was being fought to the death. Otherwise, one point
is restored for each full day the character rests. A <I>restoration </I>spell can restore permanently lost points, and a <I>heal </I>spell can restore temporarily lost points.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Damage: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The temporary damage a character suffers after a duel automatically returns at
a rate of one hit point per round. If temporary damage reduces the character-s
hit point total to ?10 or less, the character dies. If the character's hit
point total is 0 to ?9 he is unconscious until his hit points rise to at least 1.
<P></P>
A victorious character cannot suffer more temporary damage than was suffered
in the duel. The loser, however, can suffer more normal damage than was suffered
during the duel-the shock of defeat is what inflicts the damage. The Death
From Massive Damage rule does not apply in duels (see <A HREF="DMG_DD00499.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00499.htm">DMG</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, Chapter 9).

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Charm: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The mental effects from a duel fought for service are unaffected by any form
of special resistance, including magic resistance, racial resistance to charm
effects, and resistance due to high ability scores. The winner bores directly
into the loser's psyche and takes control.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>System Shock: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The force of the defeat can overwhelm the loser's body and knock the character
out for a short time. A <I>heal </I>spell restores the character to consciousness. Anyone with a weapon can kill
an unconscious character with a single blow.
<P></P>
<A NAME="9474efe9"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="5"><B>
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Blown to Another Plane: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The loser is hurled through a dimensional rift, leaving behind a pile of dust.
The DM can randomly determine which plane the character is blown to or can
choose a plane appropriate to the campaign. Any equipment destroyed in the blast
remains behind. A wish can recover the lost character.
<P></P>
<A NAME="bce77766"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="5"><B>
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Death: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The force of the defeat kills the character outright. If the character is not
blown to another plane, there is a 50% chance the body disintegrates, leaving
only a pile of dust. If not disintegrated, the character can be raised,
resurrected, or reincarnated normally, but regeneration is ineffective. Only a wish can
restore a disintegrated character to life.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Outside Interference</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Any kind of attack, successful or not, on a character involved in a magical
duel disrupts the arena and ends the duel. Both characters are assumed to be the
victor for purposes of the duel's aftereffects, but the duel's other terms and
conditions are rendered invalid.
<P></P>
It is possible for onlookers to shout advice to combatants, provided that the
protective spell surrounding them allows communication. Touching the
combatants, handing them equipment, or casting spells on them automatically ends the duel.
<P></P>
Attacks against the mediator of the duel and attempts to breech the protective
spell cast by the mediator have no effect on the duel.
