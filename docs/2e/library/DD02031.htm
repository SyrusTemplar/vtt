This special and powerful spell is primarily used to defend the wizard's
stronghold. The ward protects a one-story stronghold, with a base dimension of 400
feet x 400 feet. The wizard can ward a multistory area by reducing the base area
proportionately. The following take place in the warded area upon casting the
spell:
<P></P>
<P></P>
1. All corridors become misty; visibility is reduced to 10 feet.
<P></P>
2. All doors are wizard locked.
<P></P>
3. Stairs are filled with webs from top to bottom. These act as the 2nd-level <I>web</I> spell, except that they regrow within one turn if destroyed.
<P></P>
4. Where there are choices in direction--such as a cross or side passage--a minor
confusion-type spell functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders
believe they are going in the exact opposite direction.
<P></P>
5. The whole area radiates magic. The normal use of the <I>detect magic</I> spell becomes impossible for those of less than the caster's level and
difficult for others.
<P></P>
6. One door per level of experience of the wizard is covered by an illusion to
appear as if it were a plain wall.
<P></P>
7. The wizard can place one of the following additional magical effects:
<P></P>
A. <I>Dancing lights</I> in four corridors.
<P></P>
B. A <I>magic mouth</I> in two places.
<P></P>
C. A <I>stinking cloud</I> in two places.
<P></P> 
D. A <I>gust of wind</I> in one corridor or room.
<P></P>
E. A <I>suggestion</I> in one place.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Note that items 6 and 7 function only when the wizard is totally familiar with
the area of the spell's effect. <I>Dispel magic</I> can remove one effect, at random, per casting. A <I>remove curse</I> spell will not work.
<P></P>
The material components of the spell are burning incense, a small measure of
sulphur and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of umber hulk blood, and a
small silver rod.
