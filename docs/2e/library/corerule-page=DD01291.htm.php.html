If a character decides to create a cursed item, the DM should determine the
cost and difficulty by comparing the cursed creation to useful items of similar
power. A <I>cursed sword –2</I>, for example, is as difficult to make as a <I>sword +2</I>. If an attempt to create a cursed item fails, it is destroyed. If the attempt
fails on a roll of 96–00, a curse of the DM’s choice falls on the creator—the
character does not wind up with a useful item instead.

If a character attempts to create an item not found in any rule book, the DM
should assign it an experience point value by comparing it to similar items that
already exist. Like choosing materials and processes for items, this task
requires imagination and common sense. If difficulties arise, stop to consider what
spells are needed to make a scroll with the same powers. <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01290.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01290.htm.php.html">Table 24</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> gives the typical range of experience values for items. If the maximum value
for the category seems too low for the proposed item, the item probably is too
powerful. When in doubt, try to err on the high side; characters attempting to
create items no one else has heard of are entering uncharted territory and are
more likely to fail than characters who stick to standard items.
