<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Survival:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> A character with this proficiency has a basic knowledge of the dangers and
challenges in certain wilderness terrain: arctic, woodland, desert, plains, or
tropical. Mountains are not usually a separate terrain type—a mountain range may
be tropical, wooded, snow-covered, etc.
<P></P>
Survival skill means the character has a good chance of finding food or water
in that environment—if there is any to be found. The character can roll a
proficiency check once a day for each category. Success means food, water, or
shelter is found. Typically it will take 1d6 hours to find water, and 2d6 turns to
forage enough food for one person.
<P></P>
A character with this skill also understands the perils inherent in sudden
storms and dangerous topical features—avalanches, quicksand, sandstorms, and
landslides, for example. The DM might allow a player to roll a proficiency check
when one of these dangers appears on the horizon—success means the character has
noticed the menace.
