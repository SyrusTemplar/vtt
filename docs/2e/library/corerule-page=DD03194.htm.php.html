<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Psionicists automatically receive the contact bonus proficiency when they are
created. Contact gives them access to psionic attacks and allows them to
participate in psionic combat. The psionic attacks come naturally and don’t take up
any proficiency slots.
<P></P>
Wild talents, however, must select the contact proficiency and place it in an
open nonweapon proficiency slot. (Note that this should occur at the point when
a character becomes a wild talent, whether when he is first created or later
in his career when his psionic ability becomes known.) Along with the
proficiency, wild talents receive only one psionic attack form. However, as a wild talent
rises in level and gains nonweapon proficiency slots, he may select additional
attack forms. These fill open slots, and the wild talent may choose more forms
(for a total of three) as he gains slots. Wild talents may never have more
than three of the five psionic attacks.
<P></P>
Psionic combat is used to assault <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03190.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03190.htm.php.html">closed minds</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> so that they can be opened to further psionic contact. This is accomplished
like other attacks in the AD&amp;D game system: The attacking psionicist selects an
attack form and makes an MTHAC0 roll equal to or exceeding the defender’s MAC.
Regardless of that MAC, a roll of 1 always fails and a roll of 20 always
succeeds.
<P></P>
Psionic attacks can be used against psionic and nonpsionic minds. A nonpsionic
mind is defined as any character without a PSP pool. The procedures are the
same, but the results are slightly different.
<P></P>
When attacking a psionic mind, psionic combat continues until one opponent is
reduced to 0 PSPs or until the battle is broken off. A mind with 0 PSPs is open
and can be subjected to other psionic powers. When attacking a nonpsionic
mind, however, only one successful attack is required to open the mind.
<P></P>
Psionic powers only can be used on <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03190.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03190.htm.php.html">open minds</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> , whether willingly opened or attacked until that state occurs. A psionic
power can be used in the same round that a mind is opened by psionic attack.
<P></P>

defender’s PSP total is reduced to 0 (in the case of a psionic character) or one
successful psionic attack breaches the defenses (of a nonpsionic character).
<P></P>
<A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03197.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03197.htm.php.html">Psionic attacks</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> require concentration. A psionicist who uses one during a combat round can
move at only half his walking rate. A character using a psionic attack also can
be disrupted the same way as can a wizard casting a spell. In the round when a
character using a psionic attack is disrupted, the attack can’t be used. A
disrupted psionic attack costs 1 PSP for the attempt.
<P></P>
Psionicists can make a number of psionic attacks in a round according to their
level: 1–6, 1/1 round; 7–12, 3/2 rounds; 13+, 2/1 round. Wild talents can
never make more than one psionic attack in a round.
<P></P>
Psionicists and wild talents receive <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03196.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03196.htm.php.html">MTHAC0 bonuses</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> depending on their Intelligence scores, making it easier to accomplish
psionic attacks.
