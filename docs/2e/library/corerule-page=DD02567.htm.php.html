take place in the most inconvenient places. Player characters tend to get into
fights while hanging on the side of a cliff, swimming in subterranean lakes,
or while venturing into fantastic planes of existence. Last but not least, many
magical spells can create strange effects. This next section addresses the most
common of these unusual conditions.
