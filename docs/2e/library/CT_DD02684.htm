</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Wrestling involves seizing and controling the defender’s body; multiple
attackers tend to hinder each other more than the defender. Even Very Large creatures
that occupy more than one space on the map cannot be wrestled <I>en masse </I>because it is impossible to coordinate their actions as the defender thrashes
about. The attacker’s companions, however, can make melee, pummeling, and
overbearing attacks against the defender. (A character involved in wrestling combat
does not count as part of the pile if his companions try to overbear the
defender).
<P></P>
It is equally difficult to involve multiple defenders in wrestling combat. A
single character can try to grapple the attacking wrestler and pry him loose
from the defender. If the rescuer achieves a hold (or a lock) on the attacker, the
original defender breaks free and the original attacker is pulled into the
rescuer’s square.
<P></P>
A hold or lock also can be broken by scoring a knockdown or critical hit with
a weapon or pummeling attack, as described above, or by overbearing the
attacker. Additional defenders who threaten the attacker can make attacks of
opportunity every time the attacker initiates an opposed roll.
<P></P>
Missile attacks directed at wrestlers have a chance to hit either characters
