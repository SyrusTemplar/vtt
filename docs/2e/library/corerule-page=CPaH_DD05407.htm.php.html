<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Description:</B> The Militarist is a
battlefield virtuoso. War is a sacred act, he believes, and a chance
for spiritual redemption. By defeating enemies in combat, he pays
tribute to his gods and secures his place in the afterlife.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Requirements:</B> A Militarist must
have a minimum score of 12 in both Dexterity and Constitution.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ministration:</B> Government or Church.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Role:</B> Typically, a Militarist
serves as an officer in an army or other military organization. In
wartime, he commands forces in the field, or engages in specialized
operations, involving reconnaissance, rescue, or sabotage. He works
alone or with a select group of elite soldiers. In peacetime, he
protects his liege's stronghold, supervises training of recruits, and
sharpens his fighting skills. He stands ready to travel to any part
of the world to defend the interests of his government or church.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A Militarist commands the respect of
nobles and peasants alike. Often, his reputation approaches legendary
status; citizens line the streets and cheer when a renowned
Militarist passes through their village. Militarists tend to bask in
such adulation, pausing to exchange a few words with starstruck
adolescents or kiss the hands of swooning maidens. They also enjoy
the trappings of their station, eager to accept awards for military
excellence and rarely refusing invitations to royal affairs.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; In combat, the Militarist naturally
assumes a leadership role. His companions will find him to be a
shrewd and fearless commander who relishes every opportunity to
engage the enemy. Off the battlefield, the Militarist tends to
withdraw, maintaining a professional but distant relationship with
his comrades. He has little interest in non-military activities,
spending most of his free time discussing strategy and tactics with
like-minded warriors, or brushing up on his combat techniques.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Symbol: </B>Any symbol with military
connotations, such as a weapon or a clenched fist.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondary Skills:</B> Armorer, Weaponsmith.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> The
Militarist must select one of the following to be called his <I>preferred
weapon:</I> sword (any), lance (any), battle axe, horseman's flail,
horseman's mace, horseman's pick. <I>Recommended: </I>Any sword, any
lance, battle axe, dagger, horseman's flail, horseman's mace,
horseman's pick. Because Militarists prefer mounted combat, they
rarely become proficient with bows, slings, and other missile weapons
difficult to use on horseback.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Because
the Militarist concentrates on military skills, he can substitute
weapon proficiencies for nonweapon proficiencies (but not vice
versa). He must expend half of his nonweapon proficiencies in this
fashion. <I>Bonus:</I> Land-based Riding. <I>Recommended:</I>
Armorer, Blind-fighting, Endurance, Jousting*, Weaponsmithing.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Armor/Equipment:</B> Standard. A
Militarist prefers plate armor, but will settle for chain mail if
that's all he can afford. However, as soon as his economic condition
improves, he <I>must</I> buy plate armor. A Militarist proudly
displays all military ribbons, medals, and commendations on his
clothing and shield.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Bonded Mount: </B>Any war horse.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Benefits:</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Mounted Combat Bonus:</I> A superb
rider, a mounted Militarist makes attacks as if he were one level
higher; a 3rd-level Militarist, for instance, attacks as if he were
4th level. He attacks as if two levels higher when riding his bonded
mount. At 19th level, he attacks at one level higher regardless of
his mount. A 20th-level Militarist isn't eligible for these bonuses.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; When making an attack with his preferred
weapon, the Militarist has a +1 damage bonus. Damage bonuses don't
apply in jousts or other tournament competitions where the intent is
to dismount or disarm, not inflict damage. They do apply to nonlethal
attempts to subdue an opponent.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp; Reaction Bonus:</I> The Militarist
receives a +2 reaction roll from all good and neutral characters of
his own culture. Evil characters respond normally.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp; Honors:</I> As he advances in level,
the Militarist receives the honors listed in Table 20. The honors
presume loyal service and no significant ethos violations. The DM may
withhold any honor he feels the Militarist doesn't deserve.</FONT></P>

from making a report if he makes prior arrangements. Otherwise,
failure to report constitutes an ethos violation.</FONT></P>
