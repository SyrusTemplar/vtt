<P></P>
This god celebrates the arts, particularly the visual arts (such as painting
and sculpture).
<P></P>
The priests of this god are devoted to encouraging the visual arts of every
sentient race; and though they seem to be devoted to a non-violent cause, they
have to learn so many different types of magic (especially Divination, to learn,
and Creation, to create), they are very powerful magically, even in combat
situations.
<P></P>
Lesser gods of this attribute would be devoted to specific arts: A God of
Sculpture, for example.
<P></P>
Gods of the arts are equally likely to be of either sex.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Community,
Crafts, Culture, Divinity of Mankind, Light, Literature/Poetry, Metalwork,
Music/Dance, and Sun.
<P></P>
<B>Alignment:</B> The deity is good; at the DM's discretion, he may be chaotic good, neutral
good, or lawful good, but tends to be neutral good. Regardless of his alignment,
his priests may be of any good alignment. The flock may be of any neutral or
good alignment.
<P></P>
<B>Minimum Ability Scores:</B> Wisdom 13, Intelligence 12. Wisdom or Intelligence 16 means +5% experience;
Wisdom <I>and</I> Intelligence 16 means +10% experience.
<P></P>
<B>Races Allowed:</B> Dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, humans.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon and Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Nonweapon Proficiencies Required: Artistic Ability (DM can choose which art
form, or can let player choose). Nonweapon Proficiencies Recommended:
Reading/Writing, Religion. Weapon Proficiencies Required: None. Nonweapon Proficiency
Group Crossovers: Priest, General.
<P></P>
<B>Duties of the Priest:</B> Guidance, Marriage. Encouragement of people, even those not in the flock, who
exhibit artistic abilities. Participation in semiannual events where artists'
works are displayed (in shows, or before the local rulers, or in displays in
the marketplace). Punishment of those who defile or destroy great works of art.
Vigilance: Art often shocks the sensibilities of those who do not appreciate
certain of its forms, so these priests must be vigilant against censorship.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon and Armor Restrictions:</B> Weapons Permitted: Bows (all). Armor Permitted: None; no shields. Oriental
Campaigns: Also daikyu. All together, these constitute Poor combat abilities.
<P></P>
<B>Other Limitations:</B> Priests of the Arts gain only 6-sided hit dice, not 8-sided.
<P></P>
<B>Spheres of Influence:</B> Major Access to All, Astral, Creation, Divination, Elemental, Plant,
Protection, Sun. Minor Access to Healing, Necromantic. This gives the priest one extra
major access and four too few minor accesses, for a priest with Poor Combat
Abilities; this is nearly balanced, but he'll also have some Granted Powers.
<P></P>
<B>Powers:</B> <I>Identification</I> of and <I>Immunity</I> vs. (as described in the Designing Faiths chapter) certain spells. Because of
the priest's superior insight into creativity and art, he is Immune (receives
an automatically-successful saving throw) to all first-level wizard Illusion
spells for which a saving throw is possible, and gets a +2 saving throw vs. all
other Illusion spells for which a saving throw is possible (he can't make a
saving throw against someone else's <I>invisibility</I>, for instance). Additionally, even when he fails a saving throw or a saving
throw doesn't apply, he can still tell when the following spells are being used
(if he can see the area affected by the spell): <I> change self , spook , Leomund's trap , fear , hallucinatory terrain , and
vacancy.</I> This ability does not allow the priest to tell which spell is being used.
Also, this does not make the priest immune to the effects of the spell (for
example, he'll still be scared by <I>spook </I>), but he'll know it was an illusion.
<P></P>
<B>Followers and Strongholds:</B> The followers are received at 8th level, and consist of five third-level
priests and five first-level priests, all of the same order, plus twenty Normal Men
and Women with artistic Nonweapon Proficiencies. The priest may take the
following on adventures: Four priests (no more than two of whom may be third-level)
and four Normal Men and Women. The priesthood will pay for half of the cost of
stronghold construction at 8th level. The priest must act as a patron of the
arts for the surrounding area, and must work to make his stronghold a center for
the teaching of those who show artistic promise.
<P></P>
<B>Possible Symbols:</B> Chisel, pallet, paint brush.
<P></P>
<B>Notes:</B> The bow, the only weapon allowed for these priests, was chosen because it is
a symbol representing inspiration.
