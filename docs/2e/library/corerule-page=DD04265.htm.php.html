One of the more bizarre contentions held by priests of the School of Thought
is generally scoffed at by outsiders. The theory states that once a thought has
occurred in someone's brain, it exists as a &quot;freestanding mental object.&quot; This
&quot;thought object&quot; usually remains inside the brain of the creature that created
it, but sometimes it escapes (this supposedly explains why people forget
things). When this happens, the thought object stays in the geographical area where
it was lost. Any receptive brain (usually the brain of the creature that
initially created the thought) can pick it up again simply by bumping into the
invisible, free-floating thought. According to the theory, this is the reason that
people can regain a lost thought by going back to the location where the thought
was lost. This supposedly works because the free-floating thought is recaptured,
not because the locale reminds them of the thought. Unfortunately for
philosophers who disagree with this, <I>thought capture</I> seems to be extremely strong evidence for this theory.

This spell makes the priest's brain something of a magnet that attracts
thought objects in close proximity. The priest can sense strong thoughts and emotions
and can sometimes even see momentary visions of creatures who died or suffered
some powerful emotion in the immediate vicinity. Thought objects are always
attracted to the priest in the order of the strongest (those attached to powerful
emotions or significant events) to the weakest. Thus, if several thought
objects share the same vicinity, the priest will perceive information about the most
interesting or significant event. The priest might pick up images of a battle
from the point of view of a warrior who died there, or he might gain
information about the victor of the battle.

The DM dictates the information provided to the priest, and thus can use this
spell to provide players with important background information or can add
texture to a campaign world. The information provided might be highly cryptic or
symbolic, perhaps in the form of a rhyme or riddle.
<P></P>
The priest gains one thought object per casting of the spell. The spell may be
cast a number of times in the same locale, with the priest gaining a different
thought object with each casting. A locale contains a finite number of
thoughts, however, and once the priest has gained all of them (per the DM), the spell
will fail in that locale.
