This magic must be cast upon a normal object--a length of vine, a stick, a
pole, a rope, or a similar object. The spell causes the object to rise slightly
off the ground or floor it is resting on to trip most creatures crossing it, if
they fail their saving throws vs. spell. Note that only as many creatures can be
tripped as are actually stepping across the enchanted object. Thus, a
3-foot-long piece of rope could trip only one man-sized creature. Creatures moving at a
very rapid pace (running) when tripped suffer 1 point of damage and are
stunned for 1d4+1 rounds if the surface they fall upon is very hard (if it is turf or
other soft material, they are merely stunned for the rest of that round). Very
large creatures, such as elephants, are not affected at all by a <I>trip</I> spell. The object continues to trip all creatures passing over it, including
the spellcaster, for as long as the spell duration lasts. A creature aware of
the object and its potential adds a +4 bonus to its saving throw roll when
crossing the object. The enchanted object is 80% undetectable unless a means that
detects magical traps is employed or the operation of the spell is observed. This
spell does not function under water.
