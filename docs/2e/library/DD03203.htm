<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">The Five Psionic Defenses</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Both psionicists and wild talents develop psionic defenses naturally when
they progress in experience, as detailed on <A HREF="DD03222.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03222.htm">the Psionic Progression chart</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> . Psionic defenses are gained without using up any proficiency slots. As with
psionic attacks, wild talents may never have more than three of the five
psionic defenses.
<P></P>
A character activates a psionic defense at the beginning of a combat round.
This defense protects against all psionic attacks launched at the character in
that round. The PSP cost is only paid once per round, no matter how many attacks
it defends against in that round.
<P></P>
Some psionic attacks are more effective against certain psionic defenses. The
reverse is also true. This is represented by <A HREF="DD03196.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03196.htm">modifiers</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> that apply to the attacker’s MTHAC0. See the <A HREF="DD03209.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03209.htm">Psionic Attacks vs. Psionic Defenses</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> , below, for a cross-referenced list of penalties and bonuses.
<P></P>
When a psionic attack clashes with a psionic defense, cross-index the attack
with the defense on <A HREF="DD03209.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03209.htm">Table 76</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. The resulting modifier is applied to the attacker’s MTHAC0. Thus, positive
modifiers are bonuses and negative modifiers are penalties.
<P></P>
Combat cards that list psionic attacks and defenses are strongly recommended.
Use 3x5 cards; one for each attack or defense that a character has. During a
round of psionic combat, each player puts an attack and a defense in front of
him, face down, to lock in his action. After all declarations have been made,
cards are turned over and combat commences.
<P></P>
There are five psionic defenses.
