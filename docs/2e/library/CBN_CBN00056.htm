</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This ability enables the necromancer to shift his or her form into the plane
of shadow, becoming a two-dimensional, substanceless form, capable of slipping
under doors and through tiny cracks. While in this shadowy state, the wizard
cannot cast spells or otherwise physically attack other creatures, and is limited
to his or her normal movement (possibly augmented by magical items or any
spells which were cast prior to entering the shadowy state). Refer to the wizard
spell <I>shadowform (WH)</I> for this formâ€™s limitations.
<P></P>
The wizard can maintain this shadowy state almost indefinitely, provided that
he or she stays fully alert and conscious and remains exclusively in an area of
shadows. The wizard can be forced out of this shadowy state by exposure to
bright light or complete darkness. This power may be used up to three times per
day.
