Daggers have been used to aid climbing by thieves for generations, so it is to
be expected that a more specialized form has been developed for this task.
Climbing daggers have relatively short blades (some 6 to 8 inches long) which are
stiff, strong, flat, and very sharp. This allows the dagger to be inserted into
wood or between bricks with greater ease than an ordinary dagger. They can be
used in all surfaces other than very smooth ones. The handle is also flat and
quite broad, and usually bound with leather strips or thick string to give the
hands a good grip, or even to allow feet easy purchase when the dagger is used
as a step. Also, in place of a normal pommel is a broad, smooth iron ring. This
allows a rope to pass through, or it can be attached to one of the straps of a
housebreaker's harness (see <I>Miscellaneous Equipment</I>, below).

Climbing daggers may add +10% to wall climbing chances at the DM's option,
although their main use is with a housebreaker's harness. They may be used in
combat, but because of their very different design from that of a normal dagger a
separate weapon proficiency is required for their use and damage caused is but
1d3/1d2.
