Reducing Spell Cost</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Just as wizards can allocate extra energy to hold magicks free, cast spells of
higher level than normal, or gain additional levels of casting ability, they
may also save spell points by memorizing fixed magicks with limitations or
reduced power levels. A spell may be reduced in cost by 25% (round up) per
limitation selected, to a maximum reduction of 50% for two limitations. Restrictions
include the following:

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Reduced Spell Power: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">By investing a spell with less energy than normal, a wizard can save a few
spell points. This reduces the caster’s level by four, affecting range, duration,
damage, and all other level-based variables. In addition, the spell can be more
easily <I>dispelled</I>, since the effective casting level is used for this purpose.
<P></P>
If the spell has<I> no </I>level-based variables (e.g., <I>charm person</I>) this limitation cannot be selected. A wizard must be at least 5th level in
order to take this limitation.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Prolonged Casting Time: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The wizard can store less energy than normal in the spell, hoping to draw
energy from his immediate environment when the time comes to cast it. This results
in a lengthy period of gathering energy before actually releasing the spell.
Spells with a casting time of less than one round require a preparation time of a
number of rounds equal to the spell’s listed casting time, so a spell with a
casting time of 3 would require three full rounds of uninterrupted concentration
before the wizard could actually cast the spell. Spells with a casting time of
one round require one full turn to cast, and spells with a casting time of
more than one round can’t be reduced in cost through this limitation.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Special Casting Condition: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">By narrowing the focus and application of a spell, a wizard can reduce the
amount of energy and effort required to commit it to memory. For example, the
wizard can memorize a spell that can only be cast by the light of the moon or only
affects certain types of objects (such as a <I>shatter </I>on crystal only). If the spell is particularly restrictive, the DM may allow a
50% reduction in cost. For example, a spell that can only be cast while the
wizard is standing in one specific place of power in the middle of nowhere might
qualify. Naturally, the DM should keep a <I>very </I>close eye on spells with this limitation; if it’s not really a limitation, the
wizard shouldn’t catch a break for it.
<P></P>
Instead of requiring certain conditions to be right for casting, the wizard
might have to take special steps to ensure that the target can be affected. For
example, his <I>charm person </I>spell might require the caster to know the target’s name or spend a turn
conversing with the subject. Or, a <I>magic missile </I>might have no effect unless the wizard has touched the subject with his bare
hand that day. It’s even possible that a wizard may have a spell that
automatically fails against a target wearing a certain color or carrying a lucky charm.
<P></P>
A wizard shouldn’t have more than one or two casting conditions that he
normally observes. It’s fine for a shadow mage to have a number of spells that can’t
be cast in daylight, but if he also has another spell that can’t be used while
it’s raining, and a third that only affects orcs, the character concept is
clearly being discarded in favor of game effect.
