a command will be surprised, however, as the <I>rug of smothering</I> rolls itself tightly around him, suffocating him in 1d4+2 rounds. The rug
cannot be physically prevented from wrapping itself, and it can be prevented from
smothering its victim only by the casting of any one of the following spells: <I>animate object, hold plant, wish.</I>
