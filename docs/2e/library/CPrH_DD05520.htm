Most faiths have a definite organization, with more experienced priests
leading less experienced ones. In some faiths, bribery and corruption can allow a
less experienced priest to gain power and influence over more experienced ones,
but this is uncommon.
<P></P>
In the AD&amp;DÂ® game, most faiths are organized based on the experience levels of
their priests. The higher in level a priest is, the higher he may be in the
faith's organization.
<P></P>
But the DM needs to note a couple of important facts.
<P></P>
First, most NPC priests start at first level and never rise any higher than
second. The player-character priest, who gains levels throughout a career that is
mostly characterized by <I>adventure</I> is an exception to the usual rule.
<P></P>
Second, the PC priest, with his (comparatively) meteoric rise through levels,
may not wish to or may not be able to enjoy the benefits and responsibilities
of most priests. Many priest PCs will wish to forego the duties of running a
temple and stay on the road, acting as a mobile agent for their faith. This is a
viable option for a priest in a campaign.

More on this subject is discussed in the &quot;Role-Playing&quot; chapter.
