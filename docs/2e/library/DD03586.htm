A great number of spells employ fire as a weapon. Fires create smoke, foul
contained atmospheres, and may spread to nearby flammables.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Visibility: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Flames don?t produce smoke?burning objects or creatures do. A <I>fireball</I> thrown in an unfurnished room of bare stone against a creature that won?t
burn well (say, an ice elemental) will leave very little in the way of heavy
smoke. On the other hand, a <I>fireball </I>thrown in a sod house or a wooden building cluttered with greasy old furs and
shoddy furniture will create a number of smoky residual fires and quickly cloud
up the surroundings. Generally, a fire spell creates a cloud of smoke in its
area of effect that persists for 2d4 rounds. This obscures vision, forcing all
characters and monsters to suffer a ?2 penalty on missile attacks through the
smoke. The stink of burning objects may also hinder creatures that rely on scent
to detect their enemies.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Environmental Effects:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Fire spells naturally cause fires. See <B>Item Saving Throws </B>on page 58 of the <A HREF="DMG_DD00330.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00330.htm">DMG</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> . In addition to the affected characters, the DM can roll an item saving
throw for the surrounding area; for example, if a stone room is furnished with
tapestries and wooden benches, the DM can use the row for cloth and thin wood.
<P></P>
If an item (or a victim?s clothing, for example!) fails its saving throw, it
may be <I>on fire</I>. People who catch fire suffer 1d4 points of damage in the following round and
an additional die of damage in each subsequent round?for example 2d4 in the
second round, 3d4 in the third round, and so on?until they extinguish the flames.
The victim must pass a saving throw vs. death magic in order to extinguish the
flames and may gain a +2 to +8 bonus (DM?s discretion) if he uses a sensible
method for doing so.
<P></P>
Large fires in confined areas (for example, dungeon rooms) can be especially
dangerous since they deplete the oxygen in the air, making it unfit for
breathing. If a fire fills more than 50% of an enclosed room or space, it fouls the
air. Air-breathing creatures inside the room are affected as if the entire chamber
had been targeted with a <I>stinking cloud </I>spell. After 1d6 rounds of ventilation (or 1d6 hours in an unventilated area),
the atmosphere returns to normal.
<P></P>
One more thing about big fires: they make things hot. Imagine a character?s
surprise when he goes to open the castle gates just after the wizard?s <I>fireball </I>goes off! In fact, the DM may rule that metal and stone objects retain enough
heat to be affected as if they were struck with a <I>heat metal </I>spell, although under most circumstances they will only be heated to the
minimal damage level of the spell.
