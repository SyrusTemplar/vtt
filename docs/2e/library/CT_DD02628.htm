<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Similarly, characters can spend time and effort learning how to use their
armor more efficiently. While this doesn?t provide a bonus to Armor Class, it can
help to offset the hefty encumbrance penalties of heavy armor. A character who
spends a weapon proficiency slot becoming acquainted with a type of armor gains
the special benefit of only suffering one-half the normal encumbrance of that
armor.
<P></P>
For example, chain mail normally weighs 40 pounds, but a character with a
proficiency in chain mail only has to count 20 of this towards his encumbrance
level. This represents the character?s training in wearing the armor just the right
way and his practice in moving around while wearing 30 or 40 pounds of
ironmongery.
