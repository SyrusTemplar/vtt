In the Wilderness Warriors campaign, the player-characters are members of
tribes or clans living in harsh wilderness environments. Such campaigns are, again,
very similar to the choices for Barbarians and Berserkers campaigns, but one
of the differences and attractions of the Wilderness Warriors campaign is the <I>setting</I>.
<P></P>
In such a campaign, the DM must go out of his way to spotlight the wonder and
danger of the setting. These are true wilderness adventures, where nature and
monsters are the characters' enemies much more frequently than enemy men or
demihumans.
<P></P>
And because wildernesses are so big and unexplored, the characters, in their
wanderings, may encounter many unusual cities and societies, ruins and treasures.
<P></P>
For example, in a Desert Nomads campaign, the characters might be fighting a
rival nomad tribe when a vast sandstorm, lasting hours or days, forces them all
to seek shelter. When the storm blows over, it has uncovered a long-buried
city. The two forces continue their war through the streets, buildings, and
catacombs of the city . . . while the ancient evil that was buried with the city
slowly awakens . . .
<P></P>
In an Arctic Warriors campaign, the local seal or whale population might have
disappearedâ€”been hunted to extinction, or just left for mysterious reasons. In
the campaign, the PC heroes have to wander over unexplored regions to find a
new place capable of sustaining the tribe; they'll encounter yeti, ice golems
controlled by frozen liches, avalanches, frost giants, and other arctic perils
before they find their promised land.
