<FONT SIZE="4"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>New Proficiencies</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Rangers of any character kit can acquire
these proficiencies by spending the points listed in Table 55. The
&quot;Crossover Groups&quot; mentioned at the end of the description
are eligible to buy the proficiency at the normal cost. Groups not
mentioned may buy the proficiency by paying one additional point
beyond the listed cost.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Alertness</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A character with this proficiency is
exceptionally attuned to his surroundings, able to detect
disturbances and notice discrepancies. A successful proficiency check
reduces his chance of being surprised by 1. (This replaces the
description of this proficiency in<I> The Complete Thief's Handbook</I>.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Crossover Groups:</B> General.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Boating</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; This proficiency allows the character to
pilot any small boat, such as a kayak or canoe, operating it at
maximum speed. It also allows him (or the character) to make minor
repairs and improvements in these boats, such as waterproofing them
and patching holes. A successful proficiency check enables the
character to handle the craft in treacherous situations; for
instance, maneuvering the boat though choppy water without capsizing
it, or avoiding collisions when guiding it through a narrow channel
choked with rocks or ice. Note that while the navigation and
seamanship proficiencies deal with ships in oceans, seas, and other
large bodies of water, the boating proficiency is confined to small
craft on rivers, lakes, on oceans close to shore, and over similar
terrain, usually on relatively calm waters.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Crossover Groups:</B> General.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Camouflage</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; By using this proficiency, the character
can attempt to conceal himself, his companions, and inanimate objects
by using natural or man-made materials. Successful use assumes the
availability of all necessary materials. In forests and jungles, the
character can use shrubbery, mud, and other readily available
resources. Arctic or similarly barren terrain usually requires
special clothing, paints, or other artificial materials (although
&quot;digging in&quot; is an old trick which may be applicable in
such terrain, depending on local conditions). It takes a character a
half-hour to camouflage himself or another person, two or three hours
to conceal a cart or inanimate object of comparable size, and a
half-day to hide a small building.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither human, demihuman, monster, nor
animal passersby will be able to see a camouflaged character,
presuming the character makes a successful proficiency check.
Camouflaged companions will also go unnoticed; only one proficiency
check is required for the entire group.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Objects may also be camouflaged. Objects
the size of a person require no penalty to the check; cart-sized
objects require a -1 penalty, while building-sized objects require a
-3 penalty. The DM may adjust penalties based on these guidelines.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Camouflaging has no effect on predators
that locate prey by scent or other keen senses; a hungry wolf can
still sniff out a camouflaged human. A camouflaged person has no
protection against a passerby who accidently brushes against or bumps
into him. Likewise, a camouflaged person may reveal himself if he
sneezes, cries out from the sting of a bee, or makes any other sound.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that camouflaging is only necessary
for persons or objects that would otherwise be partially or entirely
exposed. A person hiding behind a stone wall wouldn't need to be
camouflaged to avoid detection, nor would a buried object.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Crossover Groups: </B>Fighter, Rogue.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Cartography</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp; This proficiency grants skill at map making. A
character can draw maps to scale, complete with complex land
formations, coastal outlines, and other geographic features. The
character must be reasonably familiar with the area being mapped.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The DM makes a proficiency check in
secret to determine the accuracy of the map. A successful proficiency
check means that the map is correct in all significant details. If
the roll fails, the map contains a few errors, possibly a significant
one. A roll of exactly 20 means the map contains serious errors,
making it useless.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Crossover Groups:</B> General.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Distance Sense</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; This proficiency enables a character to
estimate the total distance he's traveled in any given day, part of a
day, or a number of consecutive days equal to his level. For
instance, a 7th level character can estimate the distance he's
traveled in the previous week. The estimate will be 90% accurate.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Crossover Groups:</B> General.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Falconry</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; This is most properly the Animal Training
(Falcon) proficiency. A character with this proficiency is an expert
in training and handling falcons, enabling him to teach them tricks
and tasks (This proficiency also allows the training of hawks at a -1
penalty. Owls are a separate proficiency and can be trained at -2).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can teach a falcon 2d4 (2-8)
tricks or tasks in any combination. It takes 2d6 weeks to teach the
falcon a trick, three months for a task. At the end of a training
period, the character makes a proficiency check. If the check
succeeds, the falcon has learned the trick or task. If the check
fails, the falcon is incapable of learning more.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If not using falconry training equipment
(see Chapter 7), the success roll required for training is penalized
by -2.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Crossover Groups: </B>General.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Note:</I> The foregoing is the
standard proficiency. Optionally, the training rules for rangers
given in Chapter 3 can be used. Training times and number of
tricks/tasks may vary.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Sample general tasks:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Hunting:</I> The falcon is trained to
hunt its natural prey: small mammals and game birds; and to return
with them to the falconer. Nearly all trained falcons receive this
training first.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Ferocity: </I>The falcon receives a +1
bonus to all attack and damage rolls, and a +2 morale bonus.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Guard:</I> The falcon shrieks at the
approach of strangers. If approached closer than 20' or 30', the
falcon will attack unless ordered not to. The bird can recognize
designated friends.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Homing:</I> The falcon recognizes one
place as its roost and returns there upon command.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Loyalty:</I> The falcon is
exceptionally loyal to an individual selected by the trainer. It has
a +4 saving throw bonus against charm, control, empathy, or
friendship attempts by others. Further, it comes when the individual
summons it, guards its master from attack and may perform unusual
acts of loyalty as decided by the DM.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Species Enemy:</I> The falcon is
trained to recognize an entire species as a natural enemy. Its basic
reaction will be hostile, it will reject empathy, and have a +4
saving throw bonus against the enemy's charm or control attempts. It
will attack the species enemy in preference to others.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Track:</I> The falcon will track a
designated creature and return. It can retrace its path to lead the
falconer to the creature.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Sample specific tricks:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Attack:</I> The falcon will attack on
command a creature designated by the falconer until called off. The
falcon's base morale is at least 11. The falcon receives a save vs.
rods against another ranger's animal empathy ability.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Capture Prey:</I> A hunt-trained
falcon will return with the prey alive and unharmed.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Catch Object:</I> Upon command, the
falcon will catch a small object thrown into the air or a small
falling object and return to the falconer.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Distract:</I> The falcon is trained to
feint at an opponent. The opponent must make a saving throw vs.
paralysis or lose its next action.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Eye Attack:</I> The falcon is trained
to strike at an opponent's eyes. A beak hit has a 25% chance of
striking an eye. An opponent struck in the eye is blinded for 1d4
rounds and has a 10% chance of permanently losing sight in the eye.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Hand Signals:</I> The falcon can be
commanded by hand signals as well as by voice.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Hide Object:</I> The falcon takes an
object from the falconer, flies away with it, and conceals it. The
falcon will retrieve the object on command.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Pit Fighting: </I>The falcon is
trained as a fighting bird. It has a +2 attack bonus against any
fighting bird that is not so trained.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Recall:</I> The falcon will
immediately return to the falconer upon receiving the command.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Nemesis:</I> The falcon is trained to
attack a specific individual. The falcon never checks morale when
attacking the individual.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Foraging</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; By using this proficiency, a character
can search a wilderness area to locate a small amount of a desired
material, such as a branch suitable for carving into a bow, enough
kindling to start a fire, a medicinal herb, or a component required
for a spell. The character must spend 2-8 (2d4) hours searching, and
the material must theoretically be available in the area being
searched (for instance an icicle isn't available in the desert, nor
dry kindling on the ocean floor). The DM doesn't confirm if the
material sought is actually available until after the character has
searched for the designated period. If the DM decides the material
isn't in the area, no proficiency check is necessary; he merely
reveals that the search was in vain.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If the DM decides the material is indeed
available, a successful proficiency check means the character has
found what he's been looking for. As a rule of thumb, the character
locates no more than a handful of the desired material, though the DM
may make exceptions (if searching for a few leaves of a particular
herb, the character may instead find an entire field).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If the check fails, the material isn't
found. The character may search a different area, requiring another
2-8 hours and a new proficiency check.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Crossover Groups: </B>Warrior, Rogue.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Persuasion</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; This proficiency enables the character to
make a compelling argument to convince a subject NPC character to see
things his way, respond more favorably, or comply with a request. The
character engages the NPC in conversation for at least 10 rounds
(meaning that the subject must be willing to talk with the character
in the first place); subjects whose attitudes are threatening or
hostile aren't affected by this proficiency.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A successful proficiency check means that
the subject's reaction is modified by +2 in favor of the character
(see Table 59 in Chapter 11 of the <I>DUNGEON MASTER Guide</I>). This
bonus is <I>not</I> cumulative with any other reaction modifiers,
such as those derived from Charisma; other reaction modifiers don't
apply. For every additional slot a character spends on this
proficiency, he boosts the reaction modifier by +1 (for example,
spending two slots on this proficiency gives a +3 reaction bonus).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Crossover Groups:</B> General.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Riding, Sea-based</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; This proficiency allows the character to
handle a particular species of sea-based mount The type of mount must
be specified when the proficiency is acquired. The character may
spend additional slots to enable him to handle other species.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to riding the mount, the
proficiency enables the character to do the following:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> When the mount is on
the surface of the water, the character can leap onto its back and
spur it to move in the same round. No proficiency check is required.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> The character can
urge the mount to leap over obstacles in the water that are less than
3' high and 5' across (in the direction of the jump). No proficiency
check is required. Greater jumps require a proficiency check, with
bonuses or penalties assigned by the DM according to the height and
breadth of the obstacle and the type and size of mount. Failure means
the mount balks; an immediate second check determines if the
character stays on the mount or falls off.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> The character can
spur the mount to great speeds. If an initial proficiency check
fails, the mount resists moving faster than normal. Otherwise, the
mount begins to move up to 2d6 feet per round beyond its normal rate.
Proficiency checks must be made every five rounds. So long as the
checks succeed, the mount continues to move at the faster rate for up
to two turns. After the mount moves at this accelerated rate for two
turns, its rate then drops to 2/3 of its normal rate. It can move no
faster than 2/3 of its normal rate until allowed to rest for a full hour.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If the second or any subsequent check
fails, the mount's movement drops to half its normal rate. It
continues to move at this half-speed rate until allowed to rest for
an hour.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> If a sea-based mount
on the surface of the water is attacked, it will normally submerge
unless it makes a successful morale roll. If the morale roll fails,
the rider can command the mount to re-surface by making a successful
proficiency check. If the check fails, the rider can attempt another
check each round thereafter, so long as he is physically able. While
submerged with the mount and attempting to force it to surface, the
rider risks drowning (see Chapter 14 of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>).
Because he's exerting himself, the number of rounds the rider can
hold his breath is equal to half his Constitution score.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Crossover Groups:</B> General.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Signaling</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; This proficiency gives the character the
ability to send messages over long distances. The character must
designate his preferred method for signaling. Typical methods include
smoke signals, whistling, waving flags, drums, or reflecting mirrors.
For each additional slot spent, the character may choose an
additional method.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Because signaling is essentially a
language, messages of reasonable complexity can be communicated. A
practiced signaller can transmit as many as 10 words per combat round.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; To interpret the signal, the recipient
must be able to see or hear it. He must also have the signaling
proficiency and know the same signaling method as the sender. To send
a message and have it understood, both the signaler and the recipient
must make successful proficiency checks. If one fails his roll, the
message is distorted; the message can be sent again in the following
round, and proficiency checks may be attempted again. If both checks
fail, or if either character rolls a natural 20, an incorrect message
was sent and received; the message has the opposite of the intended
meaning. Characters without the signaling proficiency, as well as
characters who have the proficiency but use a different signaling
method, can't understand the signals.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Crossover Groups:</B> General.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Spelunking</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A character with this proficiency has a
thorough understanding of caves and underground passages, including
their geology, formation, and hazards. The character generally knows
what natural hazards are possible and what general equipment a
spelunking party should outfit itself with. A successful proficiency
check can reveal the following information:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Determine, by
studying cracks in the walls and pebbles on the floor, sniffing the
air, etc., the likelihood of a cave-in, flash flood, or other natural
hazard. This only works with respect to natural formations, and is
negated if the natural formations have been shored up, bricked in, or
otherwise tampered with.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Estimate the time
required to excavate a passage blocked with rubble.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> While exploring
extensive underground caverns, a successful check reduces the chance
of getting hopelessly lost when confronted by multiple unmarked
passages, sinkholes, etc. to a maximum of 30%, assuming good lighting
(see DMG Table 81-82).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Crossover Groups:</B> Warrior.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Trail Marking</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; By notching trees, scattering pebbles,
piling stones, and clipping weeds, the character can mark a trail
through any wilderness area. Providing he moves at 2/3 his normal
movement rate, he can mark a continuous trail as long as he likes;
however, the longer the trail, the less likely he'll be able to
follow it back.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A successful proficiency check enables a
backtracking character to follow his own trail for a distance equal
to his level in miles. If he fails a check, he loses the trail. For
instance, assume a 3rd level character marked a 12-mile trail. His
first successful proficiency check enables him to follow this trail
back three miles. A second successful proficiency check means he can
follow the trail another three miles. The third check fails, and he
loses the trail; he's only been able to follow his trail for a total
of six miles.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The tracking proficiency isn't necessary
to use the trail marking proficiency. However, when a ranger loses
his own marked trail, he may still attempt to follow it using his
tracking proficiency. Any other characters with the tracking
proficiency may also attempt to follow a ranger's marked trail, using
the rules applicable to the tracking proficiency.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A marked trail lasts unless it is
obscured by precipitation, a forest fire, or the passage of time (an
undisturbed trail marked in a forest should last for weeks, while an
arctic trail may last less than a day during periods of heavy
precipitation; the DM decides). A ranger or other character with the
tracking proficiency may still attempt to follow an obscured trail
using the tracking rules.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Crossover Groups:</B> Warrior.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Trail Signs</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A character with this proficiency can
read symbolic messages indicated by an arrangement of stones or other
physical objects. The character must designate the method of leaving
messages preferred by his family, tribe, or culture. Typical methods
include piling rocks, stacking branches, or building snow sculptures.
When the character encounters such a message, he understands the
meaning if he makes a successful proficiency check. (&quot;A dragon
dwells in these woods.&quot; &quot;Eat the green berries for restored
health.&quot;) The message is meaningless to characters without the
trail signs proficiency. A character with the trail signs proficiency
who uses methods other than the one encountered can try to read it at
half the normal chance for success. This proficiency can also be used
to identify the cultural group or tribe that has left a specific
trail sign.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Crossover Groups:</B> Warrior, Rogue.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Veterinary Healing</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The character can attempt to heal all
types of normal animals, following the same procedures described in
the description of the healing proficiency (returns 1-3 hit points if
done within one round of wounding, once per creature per day;
continued care can restore 1 hit point per day during non-strenuous
traveling for up to 6 creatures; gives a +2 to save vs. poison if
treated for 5 rounds within a round after poisoning; diagnose
disease, magical origins identified, natural diseases take mildest
form and shortest duration). Supernatural creatures (such as
skeletons or ghouls) or creatures from another plane (such as aerial
servants or xorn) cannot be treated with this proficiency.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp; &nbsp;This proficiency is not cumulative with
the healing proficiency--the first used will take precedence. The
veterinary proficiency can be used on humans, demihumans, and
humanoids at half the normal chance for success.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;<B> Crossover Groups:</B> Priest.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Weaponsmithing, Crude</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; This proficiency allows the making simple
weapons out of natural materials. This skill is most often found in
those from a primitive, tribal, or savage background.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The crude weapons are limited to natural
materials: stone, wood, bone, sinew, reed, and the like. Crude
weapons take a certain amount of time to make. The DM may add
additional primitive weapons to the basic list.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The chance for success is based on the
character's Wisdom, with a -3 penalty. Any warrior or a character
with the hunting proficiency has a +3 bonus. The fashioner must be
proficient in the use of the weapon.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If successful, the weapon can be used
normally. If failed, the weapon is so badly flawed as to be useless.
On a roll of 20, the weapon seems sound, but will break upon first
use. On a roll of 1, the weapon has no chance of breaking except
against a harder material.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Optional:</I> Crude weapons check for
breaking upon inflicting damage; roll 1d6. Bone weapons break on a
roll of 1 or 2, stone weapons break on a roll of 1.</FONT></P>
