of the day he must sleep for eight hours. After the first day's movement, the
character must roll a proficiency check for success. If the die roll succeeds,
the character can continue his running movement the next day. If the die roll
fails, the character cannot use his running ability the next day. If involved in
a battle during a day he spent running, he suffers a -1 penalty to his attack
rolls.
