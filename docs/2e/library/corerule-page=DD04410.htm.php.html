A <I>siege wall</I> uses magical energy to fortify all external areas of a fortified building,
such as walls, battlements, drawbridges, and gates. External surfaces to be
protected must be contiguous.
<P></P>
The protective effects of the <I>siege wall</I> are compatible with BATTLESYSTEM™ rules (see Chapter 7). Creatures assaulting
the protected building have their movement rates reduced by half when trying
to scale the exterior surfaces (scaling ladders, etc.). Attackers suffer a -2
penalty to damage rolls for missile fire.
<P></P>
Damage or AD caused by war machines is reduced by 2 die levels (if normal
damage is 1d12, 1d8 is rolled instead; if damage is 1d10, 1d6 is rolled; ballista
has AD8). Damage caused by crushing engines is rolled at -2 to the damage roll
or ADs. Hits or hit points of crushing engines are reduced by half.
<P></P>
All enemies attacking a building protected by <I>siege wall</I> who enter an enclosed wall space are out of command unless they are in the
line of sight of their commander, regardless of his control diameter.
<P></P>
All exterior areas of the fortification have their hit points or Hits doubled
(see <I>Hits of Building Features</I> in BATTLESYSTEM™ rules).
<P></P>
The siege wall expires if the building is destroyed; it lasts a maximum of 24
hours.
