<I>Description:</I> The Troubleshooter, like the investigator, is often aligned against other
thieves. He has all the skills of the thief, but puts them to a different use: He
works chiefly as a security consultant, playing the part of the thief in order
to test the worthiness of his clients' defenses.
<P></P>
<I> Role:</I> The Troubleshooter's professional role is rather narrowly defined, but this
is to the rogues' liking. More than one has been known to moonlight in other,
possibly illicit activities. They may range from legitimate recovery of stolen
goods through genuine burglary.
<P></P>
As a &quot;security consultant,&quot; a thief of this sort has a legitimate reason for
his thieving skills and equipment; and the temptation for many is to use them.
For this reason, officials often keep a suspicious eye on well-known
Troubleshooters. More sophisticated governments may even require that they have some sort
of license.
<P></P>
Troubleshooters are rarely guild members, naturally enough, unless they have
been bought off in exchange for information on the clients they've served. Of
course, few such Troubleshooters will survive long; if they give a place's
security their &quot;seal of approval,&quot; and then it is broken into with ease, the
Troubleshooter's reputation will be shot, and he can expect to have more than a little
suspicion placed on his shoulders.
<P></P>
<I>Secondary Skills:</I> Any. Often has technical or engineering-type skills, however, such as
Armorer, Mason, Miner, Navigator, Weaponsmith, or Woodworker/Carpenter.
<P></P>
<I>Weapon Proficiencies:</I> Troubleshooters are permitted the normal weapons open to thieves.
<P></P>
<I>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</I> Required: Observation. Recommended: Player's choice; among those that may be
selected are Alertness, Fast-talking, Gather Intelligence, Locksmithing, and
Trailing.
<P></P>
<I>Skill Progression:</I> Picking pockets and reading languages are not of much value to the
Troubleshooter, but he will probably seek a fairly even distribution among the other
thief skills.
<P></P>
<I>Equipment:</I> Any Troubleshooter worth his wages will augment his thiefly talents with the
best available equipment. Remember, he wants to try his absolute best to break
down his client's defense—as does his client—so he'll use whatever devices will
increase his chances. Also, a wealthy client could even be persuaded to help
the Troubleshooter acquire hard-to-find thief equipment.
<P></P>
<I>Special Benefits and Hindrances:</I> Troubleshooters have an uncanny knack for . . . well, for troubleshooting. If
there's a glitch somewhere in a security system, the Troubleshooter always
seems to run into it.
<P></P>
In a way, the Troubleshooter is a living manifestation of &quot;Murphy's Law&quot;: &quot;If
anything can go wrong, it will.&quot; The Troubleshooter thief, of course,
capitalizes on this professionally. His job is to find everything that can go wrong, so
it can be fixed.
<P></P>
While everything going wrong has its ironic professional advantage, the
downside is of course that the things that go wrong often do so to the
Troubleshooter's personal disadvantage.
<P></P>
This is difficult to quantify, to define as a game mechanic. Instead, the DM
is encouraged to bring it in at his discretion during play, for maximum
excitement and role-playing fun. Fill the character's life with astronomically
improbable events and bizarre coincidences.
<P></P>
The DM is by and large left on his own to &quot;wing it&quot; with this special
benefit/hindrance, but there are two questions for him to ask himself before he brings
it into play: Would this further the plot of the adventure? Would it be fun? At
least the second question should be answered &quot;yes,&quot; and it is best if both are.
<P></P>
Furthermore, the rule to follow in deciding the specifics is: Everything
should be balanced. For every freakish mishap that works in the Troubleshooter's
favor, there should be a complementary one that works to his disadvantage.
<P></P>
<I>Races:</I> Dwarves, with their affinity for the mechanical and their lawful tendencies
(and their dour stoicism in the face of all misfortune, however ludicrous), are
the demi-humans most inclined to take this kit.
<P></P>
Some gnomes also may be found as Troubleshooters; the special
benefit/hindrance of this kit suits the pranksters well—but their employers would best be on
guard for practical jokes perpetrated in the course of the assignment. The goal
of any gnome Troubleshooter should be to turn all his mishaps into assets or
amusement, if not both.
