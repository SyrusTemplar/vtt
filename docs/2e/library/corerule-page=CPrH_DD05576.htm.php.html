This god takes the stand that all opponents to a specific cause are evil and
must be converted, redeemed... or destroyed. There could be more than one god of
redemption, one for each different cause sufficiently important to warrant
one. In this respect, they are much like the gods of Culture (and their priests
much like priests of the gods of Culture), but are primarily soldiers for their
cause.

The god of redemption is male.
