</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> is what happens to a character when an opponent attacks him successfully.
Damage can also occur as a result of poison, fire, falling, acid, and anything
even remotely dangerous in the real world. Damage from most attacks is measured in <I>hit points.</I> Each time a character is hit, he suffers points of damage. It could be as
little as 1 point to as many as 80 or more. These points are subtracted from the
character's current hit point total. When this reaches 0, the character is dead.
