</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> In addition to spell restrictions, the necromancer is slightly limited in the
choice of magical items. Since this specialist lacks a formal background in the
schools of Enchantment/Charm and Illusion, the Necromancer cannot employ the
few specialized magical items based exclusively on these spells. As a general
rule, if the magical item can only be employed by a wizard <I>and</I> it involves either spells or spell-like effects from the Enchantment/Charm or
Illusion school, then this device could not normally be employed by a
necromancer. Thus only a few items from the <I>DMG</I> and <I>TOM</I> are forbidden: all wizard scrolls with spells exclusively from Enchantment/
Charm or Illusion schools,<I> rod of beguiling, staff of command, wands of fear and illusion, robe of
scintillating colors,</I> and <I>eyes of charming</I>.
<P></P>
Magical items available to all classes, which operate without specialized
knowledge in the restricted schools, are generally allowed to specialists
(including the necromancer). For instance, a <I>potion of invisibility</I> will work whether it is imbibed by a necromancer, an invoker, or even a
troll. Similarly, the necromancer can easily employ <I>rings of human influence</I> and <I>invisibility</I>, <I>rods of splendor</I> and <I>terror</I>, <I>cloaks of displacement</I>, and all other items without class restrictions.
