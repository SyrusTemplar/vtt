<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Crystal Parrot:</B> This is a 12-inch-high statue of a parrot made of clear crystal that is
useful in the detection of trespassers. The <I>crystal parrot</I> is typically placed high on a bookcase, shelf, or a similar location that
gives the parrot an unobstructed view of the area it is to oversee.
<P></P>
To activate the parrot, the user speaks the command word, causing a soft red
glow to appear behind the parrot's eyes. Unless the crystal parrot is destroyed,
it remains active for 30 days. The user may also choose to deactivate it with
a second command word, at which time the red glow in its eyes disappears. Once
deactivated, it cannot be activated again until 30 additional days have passed.
<P></P>
The active <I>crystal parrot</I> &quot;sees&quot; everything in a 180-degree arc in front of it, to a distance of 50
feet. The <I>crystal parrot</I> can see no better than a normal parrot; that is, its vision can be obscured
by normal or magical darkness, or by physical barriers.
<P></P>
The user must instruct the parrot as to what types of intruders it is to
observe. The user may be specific (&quot;Watch for a 7-foot human male with a bald head
and a red coat&quot;) or general (&quot;Watch for all humanoid and animal intruders&quot;).
<P></P>
At the time an intruder enters the parrot's field of vision, the user will
hear a telepathic report about all intruders matching the description. The
telepathic reports will be general in nature, seldom more than brief phrases (&quot;Man
with red coat enters&quot; or &quot;Two rats enter&quot;). If the user was not specific as to
what types of intruders to watch for, the <I>crystal parrot</I> will report only the number and type of intruders (such as &quot;one woman enters&quot;
or &quot;a dozen orcs enter&quot;). The <I>crystal parrot</I> will not report the actions of intruders, merely their presence; it tells the
user when the intruders enter and leave, but nothing else.
<P></P>
The telepathic reports can be transmitted over an unlimited distance, but
cannot be communicated into other planes of existence. The telepathy is one-way;
the user cannot communicate with the <I>crystal parrot</I>.
<P></P>
The <I>crystal parrot</I> has AC 3. It shatters and becomes permanently useless if it suffers 12 points
of damage. The user is instantly aware of the parrot's destruction.
