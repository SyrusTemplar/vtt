Storage of Spell Components
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Spell components are quite small. Most spells require only the smallest
pinches of powder or a few drops of liquid. In fact, the containers that are required
to hold the materials and make them easy for a caster to find without looking
are far more bulky and clumsy than the materials themselves. Small leather
pouches, glass vials or tubes, or tiny clay finger-pots sealed with wax plugs are
the most common storage devices. Most wizards choose to store the spell
components for each of their memorized spells in separate, pre-measured amounts to
facilitate quick and accurate casting. With a system like this, there are ten to
twenty spell components to a pound-even the most powerful wizard carries only a
couple of pounds of components.
<P></P>
For some wizards, it-s a good idea to carry a bulk supply of some common
reagents from which the individual spell preparations can be drawn. For example, a
traveling wizard may find it to be a good idea to carry a whole spool of thread
or string, since several spells call for this component. A bulk container
usually contains twenty to fifty usages of the component in question and weighs
about a pound. The character can carry a dozen or more of these in a leather
saddlebag or a small trunk, ensuring that he won-t run out at a critical moment. Bulk
containers cost five times the listed expense of a component, but contain
dozens of doses.
<P></P>
Some spell components may be perishable or short-lived. These items are noted
on the component list. A perishable item can last for a week or so before it-s
useless. Obviously, the character shouldn-t purchase or store more than a few
days? worth at a time.
