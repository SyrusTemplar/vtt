<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Description: </B>Wherever a corrupt or
oppressive regime holds power, there's bound to be a Forest Runner.
Forest Runners rise in opposition to such regimes, living on the
fringes of society, usually one step ahead of the law. They're
criminals only in a technical sense, as they adhere to a personal
code that compels them to wage war against greedy aristocrats and
unjust rulers. While the powers-that-be view the Forest Runner as a
lawless troublemaker, commoners see him as hero, perhaps their best
hope against a tyrannical government.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Constantly on the move, Forest Runners
live by their wits and have learned to make do with minimal
resources. They excel in combat and make formidable opponents. Ever
active and brimming with self-confidence, Forest Runners delight in
harassing authority figures, particularly the pompous and well-to-do.
Many a hapless aristocrat has been left bound, gagged, and penniless
after a humiliating roadside encounter with a Forest Runner.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Any time after reaching 4th level, the
Forest Runner will acquire a <I>personal nemesis</I>. This is an NPC
of near equal level whose campaign goal is to capture or kill the
Forest Runner.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Requirements:</B> A Forest Runner must
have a Charisma score of at least 12.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Primary Terrain:</B> Most Forest
Runners hail from civilized regions in Forest, Hill, Plains,
Mountain, or Jungle. However, no terrain type is excluded, providing
it contains a reasonably sized and sufficiently corrupt settlement.
(A Forest Runner from a primary terrain other than Forest, modifies
the name accordingly, such as Mountain Runner, Swamp Runner, and so on.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Role:</B> The Forest Runner is usually
selfless, resourceful, and roguishly charming. A loner by
circumstance and not by choice, a Forest Runner readily allies with
adventuring parties who share his outlook. As a champion of underdogs
everywhere, the Forest Runner doesn't necessarily feel bound to his
homeland, and may journey anywhere in the world to promote justice.
Occasionally, he may join a party to acquire treasure for
distribution to the needy. If the local authorities are putting the
heat on, he may accompany a party simply to disappear for a while.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Bowyer/Fletcher,
Forester, Farmer, Hunter, Leather worker, Teamster, Weaponsmith.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> The Forest
Runner receives a bonus weapon proficiency slot, above and beyond
those he's normally allowed. The bonus slot must be filled with one
of the following weapons: long bow, quarterstaff, long sword, or
dagger. He must then fill three of his first six slots with the
remaining weapons on this list. Once he's met this requirement, he
may fill subsequent slots with any weapons of his choice.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Required:</I>
Bowyer/Fletcher. <I>Recommended:</I> Alertness*, Blacksmithing,
Camouflage*, Disguise, Endurance, Leatherworking, Persuasion*, Riding
(Land-based), Rope Use, Weaponsmithing.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Standard.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Species Enemy:</B> A Forest Runner's
species enemy should have some association with the corrupt regime he
opposes. It may be the king's pet (such as a wolf or tiger), an evil
race with which the monarchy has aligned itself (goblins or ogres), a
symbol of the government (a snake or a hydra) or a creature the
opposed officials have used in war (a dragon or a giant).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Followers:</B> Any.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Special Benefits:</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Stealth:</I> The Forest Runner has a
+5% chance to hide in natural surroundings and a +5% chance to move silently.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Inspire:</I> Once per day, prior to
making an attack, a Forest Runner may spend 2-5 (1d4+1) rounds
boosting the morale of his companions with flattering words and
expressions of confidence. He can influence a number of companions
equal to his level. If the Forest Runner makes a successful Charisma
check afterwards, the companions enjoy a +2 bonus to their morale for
the next 3-12 (3d4) rounds. Each companion also receives a +1 bonus
to his first attack roll. The inspiring speech doesn't affect
animals, other Forest Runners, or himself. The Forest Runner can't
attempt to inspire his companions in the midst of battle or while
they're occupied in any other activity.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Disguise:</I> The Forest Runner can
take the Disguise proficiency for one proficiency slot.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Reaction Bonus:</I> In his homeland or
any region where his reputation precedes him, a Forest Runner can
count on food and shelter at no charge for himself and his companions
from supportive commoners. A Forest Runner also receives a +1
reaction modifier from peasants of good or neutral alignment of all cultures.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Special Hindrances:</B> Forest Runners
will rarely develop a close relationship with any NPC with political
power. Additionally, a Forest Runner runs a constant risk of arrest
by authorities of his homeland, as well as from other regimes with
which his homeland has extradition agreements. Law-enforcement
authorities may plague a Forest Runner through his entire career.</FONT></P>
