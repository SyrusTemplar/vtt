party can proceed. Cerberus, the multi-headed dog that guards the underworld in
Greek mythology, is the quintessential guardian. Sometimes bypassing or
ignoring a guardian is the best way to deal with it.

To be effective against high-level player characters, guardians must have
defenses powerful enough to withstand at least a few rounds of a major offensive
and enough firepower to make players think twice about attacking in the first
place. The ability to detect invisible or disguised intruders is very useful for
guardians.
