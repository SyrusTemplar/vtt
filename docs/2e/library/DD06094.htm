Before creating a school, following are a few general guidelines to keep in
mind.
<P></P>
<I>New schools should be unique.</I> A new magic school should not overlap any of the existing schools. Since the
eight major schools cover a lot of ground and there are already hundreds of
spells in the AD&amp;DÂ® game, this is not as easy as it sounds. Not only should the DM
avoid new magic schools whose spells duplicate the effects of existing spells,
he should also avoid trespassing on the priest's territory. For instance, a
school of magic focusing on healing spells isn't a good idea, since it conflicts
with one of the priest's special areas.
<P></P>
<I>A new school shouldn't be too powerful.</I> The existence of a school whose spells can destroy dragons, level cities, and
render the caster invulnerable makes it extremely difficult for the DM to
maintain play balance. It's next to impossible for the DM to invent suitable
challenges for wizards wielding that much power, ultimately making the game boring
for all. The school of necromancy is about as powerful as any school should be.
<P></P>
<I>A new school shouldn't be too weak.</I> On the other hand, players won't be interested in a school that doesn't offer
them a measure of power comparable to what's available in the existing
schools. The school of greater divination is about as weak as any school should be.
<P></P>
<I>A new school must be described precisely.</I> Magical effects are difficult enough to adjudicate when their definitions are
detailed and specific. When they're indefinite and ambiguous, it's nearly
impossible to make consistent rulings and avoid frustrating players
