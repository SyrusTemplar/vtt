?? <B>Dog Sled. </B>One of the best ways to travel in snowy or icy terrain, a dog sled consists of
a wooden frame for carrying supplies, wooden runners extending the length of
the sled, a platform on which the passenger stands, and a lattice on the front
to which the dog team is harnessed. About 6-11 dogs (or equivalent) can pull a
sled 10 feet long and 3 feet wide, carrying up to 880 pounds (including the
weight of the sled). Fewer animals are required for smaller sleds. A typical 8-dog
sled travels at a movement rate of 15 with a load of about 680 lbs., including
the sled.

?? When adjudicating movement via dog sled, DMs should take into account that
animals not bred or trained to pull a sled can create a considerable amount of
trouble for the driver--tangling traces, fighting with nearby animals, and so
on--and movement could be slower than expected.

<B>Kayak.</B> This is a single-person boat, fast-moving and easy to maneuver. Its lashed
wooden frame is about ten feet long and two feet wide, covered with canvas,
sealskins, or hides of similar water-dwelling animals. The skins are attached to the
frame, allowed to tighten by drying, then coated with oil to make the craft
water resistant. The passenger squeezes into the hole in the top of the craft and
sits so his legs extend into the bow. To seal out water, the opening of the
kayak has an &quot;apron&quot; (often made of whale intestines) which the kayaker laces
around his waist. He propels the kayak with a single long oar with a paddle on
either end. A kayak can move 200'/round (its movement rate can be rounded down to
6) and it can carry 250 pounds.

<B>Water Sled.</B> This resembles a dog sled with inflated skins in place of runners, enabling
the craft to float on the surface of the water. Long leather reins, treated with
waterproofing oil, connect with the animals pulling it, usually a team of
eight seals or six dolphins. A water sled carries no more than two passengers
(about 480 pounds, including the sled), unless the animals pulling it are
exceptionally fast and strong. Made to ride as much above the water as in it, the sled
can achieve a top movement rate of 15 if pulled by strong steeds, but 9-12 is a
more sustainable speed.
