Each branch of the druidic order prefers certain sites for sacred groves.
These include the woodland groves of the forest druids, the oases of the desert
druid, the fungus-rich caves of the gray druid, and so on. In nearly every case,
the overriding requirement is that the sacred grove possess a natural splendor.
This splendor may range from the stark grandeur of a ring of standing stones
atop a hill on a windswept moor to the gardenlike beauty of a tended forest glade.
<P></P>
A sacred grove is typically between 60 feet and 360 feet across (6d6 - 10
feet). Besides the expected grass, undergrowth, bushes, trees, or other local
features, desirable groves share certain elements.

<P></P>
Sacred groves reveal themselves readily to those who know what to look for. A
grove's boundary markers often result from the efforts of generations of
druids. For example, the trees in a woodland grove may form concentric circles, the
outermost layer reserved for the largest, most ancient trees.
<P></P>
Often the trees in a sacred grove are of an unusual size or a type distinct
from others in the wood. For example, a sacred grove in a birch forest might have
many oaks. Their branches may even entwine to form natural arches to welcome
visitors. In more open terrains, sacred groves may surround themselves with
high, thorny hedges or even a river. Some groves have artificial borders, such as
an outer ring of standing stones. A few are small islands.

A quiet place of meditation blanketed with soft moss or grass lies in the
center of the grove. Druids prefer groves carpeted with soft ground cover that
encourages dancing over a floor of simple dirt or stone.

<P></P>
A spring, well, brook, or pool (often fed by a waterfall) provides the grove
with pure, drinkable water. Druids use this water in their rituals and in their
day-to-day life as well. Some druids prefer still water to a brook or spring,
since the quiet water is less distracting during meditation and can prove useful
in divination.

<P></P>
A commanding structure--perhaps the source of water--acts as a natural altar
in the grove or as a focus for worship. Other common central features include a
single great tree, a standing stone, or a fairy ring (a circle of toadstools or
other fungi). These and other features sometimes possess magical powers,
detailed in a later section.

Native Animals
<P></P>
An owl lives in a grove's great tree, a snake dwells under a stone--the druid
is never really alone in a sacred grove. The place feels alive in every sense,
and druids usually befriend a grove's inhabitants.

While the druid and any servants or family members rarely live within the
sacred grove proper, home lies not far away. A forest druid, for instance,
generally has a stone, log, or sod cottage within a mile of the grove, with a vegetable
and herb garden, and perhaps a few domestic animals.
