When this spell is employed, the wizard creates an invisible sensory organ
that sends him visual information. The wizard eye travels at 30 feet per round if
viewing an area ahead as a human would (i.e., primarily looking at the floor),
or 10 feet per round if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor
ahead. The wizard eye can see with infravision up to 10 feet, and with normal
vision up to 60 feet away in brightly lit areas. The wizard eye can travel in any
direction as long as the spell lasts. It has substance and a form that can be
detected (by a <I>detect invisibility</I> spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of a wizard eye,
although it can pass through a space no smaller than a small mouse hole (1 inch in
diameter).
<P></P>
Using the eye requires the wizard to concentrate. However, if his
concentration is broken, the spell does not end--the eye merely becomes inert until the
wizard again concentrates, subject to the duration of the spell. The powers of the
eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any
gaze attack met by the eye. A successful dispel cast on the wizard or eye ends
the spell. With respect to blindness, magical darkness, and so on, the wizard
eye is considered an independent sensory organ of the caster.

The material component of the spell is a bit of bat fur.
