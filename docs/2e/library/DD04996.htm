There are now well over 50 musical instruments for bard players to choose
from. Although such a large selection is nice, players might wonder if they have to
spend a proficiency slot for each instrument they wish their bards to master.
Fortunately, the answer is &quot;no.&quot;
<P></P>
The instruments in <A HREF="DD04998.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD04998.htm">Table 20</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> have been broken down into convenient categories and grouped appropriately
into an indented outline format. A number in parenthesis appears after each level
that contains subentries. This is the number of proficiency slots that must be
spent in order to gain proficiency in all instruments indented beneath that
level. For example, for five proficiency slots, a character can become proficient
in all wind instruments; for only three slots he can limit himself to becoming
proficient in all instruments in the flute family. Those instruments that
don't have a number next to them cost a single slot to gain.
<P></P>
Note that proficiency in an instrument or category includes not only those
instruments listed, but any others in his campaign world that fall into the same
category. Thus, if a bard spends two slots to gain proficiency in bagpipes, he
isn't limited to just the dudy and zampogna. He knows how to play any bagpipe
that exists in his campaign world.
