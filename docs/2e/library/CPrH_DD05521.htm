Below is the usual arrangement of priesthoods in a campaign. First is the
organizational structure which NPC priests usually follow; then, we'll talk about
player-characters and their place in the structure.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Level Zero (Normal Men and Women)
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
A &quot;level-zero&quot; priest is someone who has just been accepted into a priestly
order and is receiving his initial training. Player-characters do not have to
start out at zero-level; the only zero-level priests that the PCs will ever
encounter will be NPCs undergoing training.
<P></P>
<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
First-level priests are typically assigned as aids, clerks, and assistants to
higher-level priests, and keep that assignment through second experience level.
During this time, the low-level priests will be getting practical field
experience in the execution of their duties, in the way the priesthood works with the
population, and in the way the priesthood's organization works in the real
world.
<P></P>
Most first-level priests are assigned to priests of third to fifth level, but
some few (especially very capable ones) will be assigned to much more powerful
priests.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Level Three-Level Five</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
At third level, the priest will be assigned to a single community (a village,
a small town, a broad tract of land containing many scattered farms, or a
single small neighborhood in a large city).
<P></P>
If he asks for one, and the faith's leaders (i.e., the DM) agree that he needs
one, he will be assigned a first-level priest as an assistant. This priest
isn't a follower in the same fashion as the followers he receives at a higher
level, and might wish to be re-posted elsewhere if his superior is unlikable or
difficult. (However, if this assignee is still with the priest when that priest
reaches eighth or ninth level, the DM might decide for him to become one of the
priest's official followers.) If he doesn't ask for a subordinate priest, he
won't receive one.
<P></P>
The priest is assigned a small building to serve him as a temple or church.
(This is not the same as a stronghold.) The priest is supposed to finance repairs
to the building, food and supplies for himself and any assistants, and
salaries for any servants he chooses to hire through tithes and donations. Half of all
tithes and donations are sent on to the superiors, and the rest go to the
priest's own temple for these purposes. If the priest doesn't receive enough tithes
and donations, the faith will probably not help him; his mission is to inspire
his flock, and inadequate tithes and donations are merely evidence that he
needs to work harder at it.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Level Six-Level Seven</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
At around sixth level, if the priest has done a good job of maintaining his
church and seeing to the needs of his flock, he may be given a more important
assignment. He could become the chief priest of a large town (one with more than
one church; the third-level priests operating those churches would report to
him), or the central church authority over several villages.
<P></P>
He may keep any subordinate he has had previously. He will automatically be
assigned two additional first-level priests as subordinates. Again, they do not
precisely constitute &quot;followers,&quot; though those specific characters could
become followers when the priest reaches the appropriate level.
<P></P>
If the priest's work does not merit a better posting, he won't lose his
experience levels or his subordinate, but he'll be stuck in the little church that he
has been operating all this time. When a priest reaches sixth or seventh level
and is still the priest of a one-horse town, it's often a sign that he is not
held in high regard by his superiors. It may merely be a sign that there are
too many priests in the priesthood and advancement is slow.
<P></P>
Naturally, a higher-level priest can ask to be posted to or remain posted to
such a small community. Some people will snicker at his lack of ambition while
others will admire his dedication and his care for the common man.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Level Eight-Level Nine</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
At around eighth or ninth level, again assuming that the priest has done well
in his priestly career so far, he will be allowed to build a stronghold. The
faith will finance half its cost, and it remains the property of the faith when
the priest retires his post.
<P></P>
However, the stronghold is semi-autonomous; the priest's superiors seldom
interfere in its operations. They might interfere, especially by sending another
priest to investigate, if they receive rumors of incompetence, greed, or trouble
from the stronghold. Otherwise, the priest is free to operate it much as he
pleases.
<P></P>
The priest's assigned area may remain the same. He might continue to be chief
priest over a large town or collection of villages. At his request and with his
superiors' permission, or solely at his superiors' wish, he may instead build
his stronghold in some other place: In a frontier where he is supposed to
defend the peace, in a wilderness area where he and his subordinates are supposed to
work undisturbed by the secular world, etc.
<P></P>
At this same time, the priest will receive his followers, as we have discussed
earlier this chapter. The followers manage the stronghold and its duties under
the priest's administration. As discussed earlier, the levels, classes and
goals of these followers will depend on the attributes of the faith and on the
specific goals of the priest for his stronghold. If it's to be a military post
manned by holy warriors, the followers will mostly be capable fighters; if it's to
be an educational monastery, most of the followers will be Normal Men and
Women or first-level priests with appropriate scholastic talents.
<P></P>
During this time, the priest's progress and efficiency will be carefully
measured by his superiors, who are considering what role the priest will play in the
higher-level politics of the faith.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Level Ten-Level Twelve</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
Sometime between tenth and twelfth levels, the priest may find himself
promoted to prominence over a much larger area; he will be administering a bigger
chunk of the religious &quot;map.&quot; Priests of numerous cities and regions in his
vicinity (at least a fifty-mile radius) will be reporting to him, and of course he
will still be reporting to his superiors. By twelfth level, he may be the high
priest over an entire nation (assuming that the faith spans several nations, as
many faiths do).
<P></P>
He does not, however, receive any more followers.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Level Thirteen-Level Fifteen</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
The most powerful of a faith's leaders belong to these experience levels: The
high priest of the faith and his immediate advisors. If the DM wishes, politics
or the god's preference alone may decide who the high priest is, and the high
priest might then not have to be the highest-level priest of the faith. The
faith's high priest might be chosen by vote or omen, and could be a
thirteenth-level priest while all his immediate advisors are of higher level.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Level Sixteen-Level Twenty</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
These experience levels don't have any effect on the priest's ranking within
his faith. They are reflections of additional knowledge that he has learned . .
. but don't grant any additional benefits within the structure of the faith.
