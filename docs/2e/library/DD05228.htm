<P></P>
The Grab is another type of Called Shot. To perform it, you must have at least
one hand free; two hands are better if you're grabbing and trying to hold a
person.
<P></P>
When performing the Grab, begin as with a Called Shot (announce before
initiative, +1 to initiative, –4 to attack rolls).
<P></P>
If you hit, you've gotten your hand on whatever it was you were trying to
grab: It could be an enemy's weapon, an important item you're trying to retrieve,
or any such thing.
<P></P>
However, just because you've grabbed hold of the object doesn't mean that
you're in control of it. If some other person already has hold of the object, he's
going to struggle with you for control.
<P></P>
In the same round that you performed the grab, roll 1d20. Your opponent will
do the same.
<P></P>
Compare the number you rolled to your Strength ability score. Whichever one of
you rolled better against his score won the tug-of-war contest.
<P></P>
For purposes of the Grab, all 18 scores (01–50, 51–75, etc.) are just 18.
However, in case of a tie, a higher-percentile 18 beats a lower-percentile 18. (For
instance, an 18/40 beats an 18/30, an 18/00 beats an 18/99, etc.)
<P></P>
<I> Example: Rathnar the Barbarian tries to grab the Ruby Orb of Blassendom from
the hands of his enemy. He successfully rolls to attack rolls and gets his free
hand on the Orb.
<P></P>
Rathnar is Strength 17. His enemy is Strength 15. Both roll 1d20.
<P></P>
Rathnar rolls a 10. He's made his roll by 7. His enemy rolls a 9. He's made
his roll by 6. Rathnar snatches the Orb away.</I>
<P></P>
If you grab something and then fail your Strength ability roll, then you've
lost: Your enemy has snatched the object back out of your hand.
<P></P>
A tie (for instance, if both of you made your roll by 5, or both missed it by
2, or came up with any other identical answer) means that you re-roll, during
the same round. Treat this second roll as if it were a second attack in the same
round for determining when in the round it takes place (in other words, it
will take place <I>after</I> all other characters have performed their first maneuvers for the round).
<P></P>
However, all these Strength rolls resulting from a single Grab maneuver are
counted as one &quot;attack;&quot; if a character can make two attacks in a round, and his
first attack is a Grab, and the grab leads to two or three Strength rolls due
to struggling, that's all still only one attack. The character still gets his
second attack later in the round.
