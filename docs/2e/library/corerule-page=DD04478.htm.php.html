<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Flatbox:</B> A practical example of hypergeometry and hypermathematics, the <I>flatbox</I> appears to be a wooden box about 3' long, 2' wide, and two inches deep. It
weighs eight pounds. The top of the box is a hinged lid.
<P></P>
When the lid is opened, the interior of the box is filled with impenetrable
darkness. This darkness cannot be dispelled by any form of magic; it is a
characteristic of the hypergeometrical topography of the box.
<P></P>
Although from the outside the <I>flatbox</I> appears to be only two inches deep, it actually has the internal volume of a
box six feet deep. (Thus, it has a volume of 36 cubic feet.) The maximum weight
that can be loaded into a <I>flatbox</I> is 500 pounds. No matter how much of its volume is filled, the <I>flatbox</I> still weighs only eight pounds.
<P></P>
Since the inside of the box is completely dark, the only way to retrieve a
specific item is to feel around within the box. Finding an object this way takes
1d4 rounds.
<P></P>
There is a significant danger associated with the flatbox. If it is taken into
an extradimensional space (such as within a <I>portable hole</I>), if it is <I>teleported, gated</I>, or transported via<I> dimensional folding</I> or any analogous method, or if it ever suffers 15 hit points of damage, the <I>flatbox</I> explodes violently. This explosion destroys all contents of the box and
inflicts 4d10 hit points of damage on any creature within 20 feet (save vs. spell
for half damage).
