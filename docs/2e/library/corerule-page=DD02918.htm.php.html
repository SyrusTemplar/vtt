A kobold stands about three feet in height, with a scaly hide of dark brown
to rusty black, and glowing red eyes in a vaguely dog-like face. Kobolds tend
to be cowards and whiners, but are quick to turn on their enemies when they find
themselves with an advantage of numbers or position. Due to their lack of
physical prowess, kobolds specialize in dirty tricks, distractions, and traps,
using these to incapacitate or distract larger foes.

Kobolds strive to be taken seriously by larger races, and often try to make up
for their shortcomings with ferocity and tenacity. Kobold PCs are unusual
examples of the race, but even the most pleasant kobolds are still mean-spirited
and spiteful from time to time.
