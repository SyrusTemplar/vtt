Helms and helmets restrict vision and hearing. They frame the face, obscure
his vision, muffle his hearing, and generally give the character less ability to
observe what's going on around him. (They also sometimes keep maces from caving
in his skull, which is why fighters like helms and helmets.)

With these optional rules, we'll talk about different kinds of helms and
helmets, how they're used, and what other effects they have in combat.
