<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Gladiator </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Gladiators are trained to fight people and creatures for others’
entertainment. Most are flashy, outlandish showmen whose battle tactics often cater to the
crowd first, their survival second. Gladiators can be slaves who are forced to
fight, or they can be free men who choose to make a living this way. If this
kit is used in a campaign, there must either be a culture that publicly allows
this activity, or else the fights might be illegal—held in secret places and
backed by society’s shady element. Legal or not, the gladiator definitely makes his
living in an urban setting. If the campaign doesn’t revolve around, or at
least contain, a sizable city, this kit could be inappropriate.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Social ranks:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Gladiators can come from almost any economic background, though it is more
likely they come from the lower rungs of the community. Roll 2d6 to determine the
rank of a gladiator.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Requirements:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A gladiator must have Strength/Muscle and Constitution/Fitness scores of 13
or greater. This kit is barred to satyrs and swanmays. In addition, paladins,
rangers, wizards, thieves, and bards may not choose this kit.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Only melee and hurled missile weapons—no bows, slings, etc.—can be used by
such a character, as gladiatorial combats are not about firing arrows at one
another. A gladiator who kills an opponent without endangering his own life in
mortal combat is not much of a showman. Possible gladiator weapons include:
daggers, swords (all, but short swords are most common), scimitars, spears, tridents,
polearms (all), war hammers, maces (all), scourges, nets, and whips.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended nonweapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Blind-fighting, endurance, gaming, jumping, tumbling, armorer,
weaponsmithing, healing, and rope use.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Equipment:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Gladiators can have whatever weapons fit their classes. However, they are
initially limited in armor types. Gladiators cannot begin with anything greater
than studded leather.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended traits:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Fast healer, immunities, keen senses, light sleeper, lucky.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Benefits:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Gladiators enjoy a +1 bonus on attack rolls with one particular melee weapon.
For example, a gladiator could choose a +1 attack bonus with the short sword.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hindrances:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> As gladiators are trained to make combats last a long while and to play to
any crowd, they suffer a +1 penalty to their initiative rolls. They take this
time to show off, display their weapon prowess, or bait their opponent.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wealth:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Standard as per the character’s class.
