<TITLE>Starella's Aphrodisiac-- Aromatic Oil (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Starella's Aphrodisiac:</B> Any creature of a similar race and opposite sex who approaches within 5 feet
of the wearer becomes thoroughly enamored with the wearer as if under the
effect of a powerful charm. Potential victims are allowed a saving throw vs. spell.
If the roll is successful, the victim suffers no effects and may remain near
the wearer without need of further saving throws.
<P></P>
If the save is failed, the creature is charmed as long as he or she remains
within 5' of the wearer (as long as the aphrodisiac is still potent) plus 2d4
turns outside that area. An affected creature regards the wearer as a trusted
friend, ally, and romantic interest to be heeded and protected. The charmed
individual does not behave as if he were a mindless automaton, but any word or action
of the wearer is viewed in the most favorable way. This attitude does not
extend to others, and it is possible for the person so enamored to be overcome by
jealousy, viewing all others (especially other victims) as potential rivals.
<P></P>
When a dose of <I>Starella's aphrodisiac</I> is worn, it remains potent for 3d4 turns. After this time, the perfume
evaporates and another dose must be applied if the wearer wishes to renew the effect.
<P></P>
