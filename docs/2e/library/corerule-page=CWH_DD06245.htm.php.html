<P></P>
Range: 0
<P></P>
Components: V, M
<P></P>
Duration: 1 round/level

A wizard can use this spell to enchant a bone, causing it to become a magical
club. This magical weapon acts as a <I>club +4</I> against undead, inflicting 5-10 (1d6 +4) hit points of damage, and a <I>club +1</I> against all other opponents, inflicting 2-7 (1d6 + 1) hit points of damage.
The bone can be from any animal, providing the bone normally could be wielded as
a club; for instance, a human femur could be enchanted by this spell, but a
skull could not. At the end of the spell's duration, the <I>bone club</I> reverts to a normal bone.
<P></P>
If the proficiency rules are being used, characters with a weapon proficiency
with a club also have a profiency with a <I>bone club.</I> Those wielding a <I>bone club</I> without the club profiency suffer the penalties described on page 52 of the<I> Player's Handbook.</I>
<P></P>
The material components for this spell are an appropriately-sized bone and a
pinch of dirt from a grave

Range: 30 yards
<P></P>
Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 round

This spell enables one person or creature to postpone death. If <I>delay death</I> is cast before the indicated creature or person reaches 0 hit points, he is
able to fight, cast spells, communicate, and take all other normal actions until
he reaches -10 hit points. However, from the time he reaches 0 hit points
until he is reduced to -10 hit points, the affected person or creature makes all
attack rolls and saving throws at a -2 penalty, and his movement rate is reduced
by half.
<P></P>
When the subject reaches -10 hit points, he is dead and <I>delay death</I> is no longer in effect. Note that the spell has a limited duration; if the
spell expires after the affected subject has reached 0 hit points but before he
has been reduced to -10 hit points, the subject dies instantly. A deceased
subject previously under the effect of<I> delay death</I> can be raised normally by raise dead and similar spells.
<P></P>
The material component for this spell is a chip from a tombstone or a sliver
of wood from a coffin

Range: Special
<P></P>

This spell creates a glowing human skull with sharp fangs. The skull hovers
about a foot above the caster's shoulder; as the caster moves, the skull hovers
along with him. If the caster stops moving and concentrates, he can mentally
command the <I>hovering skull</I> to move in any direction within a 30- foot radius.
<P></P>
The caster can see through the skull's eyes as if they were his own; for
instance, <I>the hovering skull</I> could be ordered to investigate a dark cave or peek over a high wall.
Additionally, the caster can order the <I>hovering skull</I> to attack victims with its razor-sharp teeth. If the caster's concentration
is interrupted while controlling the skull, the skull immediately drops to the
ground (but it takes no damage). If the caster resumes concentration, he can
continue to command the skull. The <I>hovering skull</I> has the same statistics as the caster, except the skull has 3 hit points and
inflicts 1-6 hit points of damage with its bite. Attacks directed at the skull
do not harm the caster, nor does damage directed at the caster affect the
skull.
<P></P>
The material component for this spell is the tooth from a human skull.

<P></P>
Range: 0
<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>
Duration: Special
<P></P>
Casting Time: 2
<P></P>
Area of Effect: The caster
<P></P>
Saving Throw: None
<P></P>
<P></P>
A variation of the <I>armor</I> spell, this spell enables the caster to cover his body with an invisible suit
of plate mail to temporarily raise his AC to 3. Its effects are not cumulative
with other armor or magical protection (a character cannot improve his AC
better than 3 through use of this spell), but Dexterity bonuses still apply.
<P></P>
For each level of the caster, the <I>invisible mail</I> absorbs 1 hit point of damage that would normally hit AC 3; however, the <I>invisible mail</I> offers no protection against magical weapons or attacks. When the<I> invisible mail</I> has absorbed as many hit points of damage as the wizard has levels of
experience, the invisible mail disappears. The<I> invisible mail </I>does not hinder movement, nor does it add weight or encumbrance. It does not
interfere with spell casting.
<P></P>
Example: A wizard with a normal AC of 10 has shielded himself with <I>invisible mail</I>. The first opponent attacks with a normal dagger; the attack is made against
the AC 3 of the <I>invisible mail</I>. The attack is successful, causing 2 hit points of damage, but this damage is
absorbed by the <I>invisible mail</I> and the wizard is unharmed. A second attack is made with a <I>sword +1</I>. The invisible armor offers no protection against this magical weapon, so the
attack is made against the wizard's normal AC of 10.
<P></P>
The material component is a small fragment of plate mail.

automatically disbelieves all illusions cast by 3rd-level wizards (or their
equivalent) or lower.

small item made of solid iron, such as a nail.

<I>Pain touch</I> enables the caster to touch an opponent in such a way as to induce extreme
pain. The spell works if the caster touches any exposed part of an opponent's
body. The caster must be within arm's length of the opponent for the spell to
work. The spell requires a normal attack roll.
<P></P>
The pain causes no damage, but for the next 1-4 rounds, the victim will be -2
on his chance to hit and his AC is worsened by 2. The caster can cast the spell
and touch the victim in the same round. <I>Pain touch</I> is only effective on human, demihuman, and humanoid opponents.
<P></P>
The material components for this spell are a needle and the finger from a
scorched glove.

<P></P>
<P></P>
Range: Touch
<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>
Duration: 1 turn/level
<P></P>
Casting Time: 3
<P></P>
Area of Effect: 1 creature or object
<P></P>
Saving Throw: None
<P></P>
<P></P>
By means of this spell, the caster causes a set of teeth to appear on a person
or object; the teeth appear in the exact location touched by the caster. The<I> snapping teeth</I> are contained in a mouth-like orifice about 6 inches in diameter and are
capable of snapping at victims within 1 foot. A person or creature with the <I>snapping teeth</I> can cause them to snap at will, effectively giving him an extra attack per
round. A normal attack roll is made, and a successful hit inflicts 1-4 hit points
of damage. Note that the victim must be within range of the teeth and that
normal facing considerations must be accounted for (for instance, <I>snapping teeth</I> in the back of a person's head can only attack victims that are behind the
person).
<P></P>
<I>Snapping teeth</I> can also be placed on a non-living object, such as a tree or a door. In such
cases, the <I>snapping teeth</I> are invisible until they make an attack. The <I>snapping teeth</I> will attack any victim that comes within 1 foot; they attack as a 4 HD
monster, and each successful hit causes 1-4 hit points of damage. These attacks are
automatic and are not controlled by the caster. Attacks cannot be directed
against the <I>snapping teeth,</I> but <I>dispel magic</I> causes them to vanish.
<P></P>
The material component for this spell is a tooth from any carnivorous animal,
such as a wolf, shark, or serpent.
