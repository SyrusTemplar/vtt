Group: Warrior, Rogue Initial rating: 3

A character with this talent is unusually fast. Her hand-eye coordination is
excellent, and she can often get past her opponent’s defenses before they
realize how quick she really is. In combat, she gains a special –2 bonus to her
initiative roll if she makes a proficiency check. She can use this bonus if she
moves or makes an attack with a weapon of average speed or quicker, but her special
bonus does not apply to attacks with slow weapons or stationary actions such
as guarding or parrying.
