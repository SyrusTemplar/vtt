</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">These massive engines are similar to catapults, but they derive their power
from gravity. A trebuchet’s throwing arm is a rigid beam with a heavy weight at
one end and a sling or cup for projectiles at the other. When the beam is
released, the force of the falling weight hurls the projectile in a high arch. Like
catapults, trebuchets fire large stones or masses of smaller objects.
<P></P>
Trebuchets generally are left in place once they are sited for a battle. A
full crew can change a trebuchet’s facing after 30 minutes of work.
