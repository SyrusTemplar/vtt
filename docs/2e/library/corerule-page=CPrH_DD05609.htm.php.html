Any multi-class priest can take one of the Priest Kits above. However, he can
only take one kit, total. If he has several character classes, he can't take a
separate kit for each class.
<P></P>
The same is true of dual-class characters. If a character begins play as a
priest and takes one of the kits above, and then later changes to another class,
he does not have to abandon the kit. However, he still may only have one kit.
Also, if he chooses to abandon the kit when he changes class, he may not then
take on a kit from the new class. The character may only have had one kit, ever,
as long as he is played.
