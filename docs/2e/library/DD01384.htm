<I>Bribe: </I>A thief can bribe an NPC with minor gifts of money or merchandise. Only one
bribe can be attempted per target. If the attempt fails, the DM should make a
reaction roll for the target to determine how he counters the bribe.
<P></P>
The amount of money required for a bribe varies with the NPC?s status,
according to the table below:

<I>Bribery procedure: </I>It is best to role play an attempt at bribery, but here are a few guidelines:
<P></P>
First, the DM must decide if the NPC in question can be bribed, not everyone
is susceptible. No character can be bribed to do something that falls outside
his job or station. A simple peasant or a palace guard would not agree to
assassinate his king or liege lord for a few coins. However, the peasant might offer a
party shelter for the night or hide the thief from a search party. A guard
might agree to look the other way while the party sneaks out the gate.
<P></P>
Likewise, a simple bribe never induces a character to compromise something he
believes in or do something that places the character in danger. For instance,
an acolyte cannot be bribed to look the other way while the party defiles a
holy water font. In any case, an NPC bribed through the use of this skill does not
perform any action that takes more than a few minutes of effort or places
himself in danger?the task must strike the character as something that is quick and
harmless.
<P></P>
Once the DM decides that the NPC can be bribed, use Table 59 (<B>Encounter Reactions</B>, from the<I> <A HREF="DMG_DD00564.htm"></A></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="DMG_DD00564.htm">Dungeon Master Guide</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) to determine how the NPC responds when meeting the thief. Secretly roll 1d20
and find the NPC?s reaction on the table. Do not tell the player what the
reaction is, simply role play the NPC?s response to whatever the thief does.
<P></P>
If the die roll results in a friendly reaction, the NPC probably does what the
thief wants without a bribe. If not, the thief has to offer something?money,
services, a magical item, information, or anything else valuable?to sweeten the
NPC?s reaction. To determine the exact amount required, roll on the <A HREF="DD01384.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01384.htm">bribery table</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, above, and multiply the result by the difference between the reaction roll
and the highest number on <A HREF="DMG_DD00564.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00564.htm">Table 59</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> that is a friendly result.
<P></P>
The player should never be told exactly the NPC?s station, the base bribe
value, or the initial reaction roll. Good role-playing on the DM?s part should
allow a perceptive player to guess the first and the last.
<P></P>
For example, Jobare, the King of Thieves, approaches a peasant in a friendly
manner and starts fishing for information about the local baron. The DM rolls a
13 for the peasant?s reaction and checks the number on the first column in
Table 59 (because Jobare is acting friendly); the peasant is cautious. The DM
decides that the peasant is suspicious, and thinks the thief is a spy or bandit.
?Boy, stranger, you sure do ask a whole lot of questions,? says the peasant while
backing away slowly.
<P></P>
The DM secretly rolls 2d4 and discovers that the base value of the bribe is 5
cp. However, the highest number that gives a friendly result on the first
column of Table 59 is a 7, the difference is 6 (13?7), so Jobare has to give at
least 30 cp (5x6) to make an effective bribe. Once Jobare pays the required amount,
the player can make a bribery roll. If it succeeds, Jobare can ask a few
simple questions and get equally simple answers.
<P></P>
<I>Detect illusion: </I>Thieves, masters of deception themselves, can see through visible illusions
within their line of sight, up to 90 feet away. They perceive the illusion as a
translucent image, seeing through it as though it were a light mist. The more
real the illusion, the more solid the image.
<P></P>
For example, <I>phantasmal force </I>would be totally translucent, while a <I>simulacrum </I>would be mostly solid. <I>Demishadow monsters </I>would be somewhere in between the two. <I>Invisibility </I>and other nonvisible effects cannot be discerned.
<P></P>
Detection is not automatic, and the thief must spend a round concentrating on
the area of effect to discover its illusionary qualities. Knowing that
something is an illusion is not necessarily a fail-safe defense against illusionary
magic, such as in the case of a <I>simulacrum</I>.
<P></P>
<I>Detect magic: </I>Thieves can spot magical emanations within their line of sight, up to 60 feet
away. They can determine the intensity of the magic?dim, faint, moderate,
strong, and overwhelming. This ability can be blocked by the same things that
prevent <I>detect magic</I> spells from operating.
<P></P>
<I>Escape Bonds: </I>There comes a time in every thief?s career when his luck runs out and he is
apprehended. The ability to escape bonds such as ropes, leather thongs, manacles,
chains, and even straight jackets is a feat of contortion and determination.
The thief must roll to break free of every device binding him. If he?s tied at
the wrists and at the ankles, he must make two successful rolls to free himself.
This skill takes five rounds to use. A thief might hurry his efforts, but he
suffers a ?5% penalty for each round he tries to shave from the required time.
Locked items also require the thief to successfully pick the locks. A failure on
any attempt means that the thief cannot loosen that bond or pick the lock.
<P></P>
<I>Tunneling: </I>A thief might need to dig a tunnel to get to a cache of riches. His success at
tunneling depends on several factors. The tunneling table below shows the time
required to dig a 10-foot tunnel with adequate tools. Every 10 feet, the thief
must make a skill check, failure means that the front of the tunnel collapses.
It can be re-dug at the loose earth rate.

In
that case, the thief gains 50 bonus character points at 21st level. The
character must use the points to buy thieving skills from Table 27 in <A HREF="SP_DD02942.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="SP_DD02942.htm">Skills &amp; Powers</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. If the thief already has 9 or more of the skills listed on Table 27, the
character cannot spend all 50 points on thieving skills and is allowed to spend
them on proficiencies and high-level rogue skills instead. The ability to acquire
additional thieving skills is a special bonus for reaching 21st level; it is
not normally possible to gain additional thieving skills after the character is
created
