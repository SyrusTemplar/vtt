Two-Hander Style involves carrying and wielding a weapon with both hands.
Naturally, many weapons (including polearms, the great axe, the two-handed sword,
and others) require two-handed technique. Other weapons (such as bastard sword,
javelin, and spear) have it as a listed option. (Two-handed options for
Harpoon, Javelin, Long Spear, Spear, and Trident are given in the <I>Equipment</I> section of this rulebook, not in the <I>Player's Handbook</I>.)

<P></P>
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The main advantage of two-handed weapon technique is that it allows the
character to wield large two-handed weapons which can do substantial amounts of
damage.
<P></P>
A second advantage is that, if you are using a two-handed weapon, the Disarm
maneuver (see &quot;Melee Maneuvers,&quot; below) is only of partial use against you.
<P></P>
A single successful Disarm against a two-handed weapon user won't knock the
weapon out of the wielder's hands; it will merely knock his weapon askew and make
him take some time to recover, so he automatically loses initiative on his
next round.
<P></P>
However, two Disarm maneuvers successfully made against the character in the
same round <I>will </I>knock the weapon loose.

<P></P>
<P></P>
As with single-weapon use, two-handed weapon technique has the drawback that
the user cannot wear or use a shield, or gain the shield's AC bonus.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
You can, by devoting a weapon proficiency to it, take a Style Specialization
with Two-Hander Style.
<P></P>
Style Specialization with Two-Hander Style gives you a very specific benefit:
When you're using a weapon two-handed, that weapon's Speed Factor is reduced by
3.
<P></P>
For example, a fighter with Two-Hander Style Specialization and wielding a
Bastard Sword can wield his weapon faster in two-handed style than in one-handed
style. Used in one hand, the Bastard Sword has a Speed Factor of 6. In two hands
(normally), it has a Speed Factor of 8. But used in two hands by someone with
Two-Hander Style Specialization, it has a Speed Factor of (8â€“3) 5.
<P></P>
This is because when a fighter wields such a weapon with both hands on the
hilt, he has more leverage on the blade and can move it faster. That's what Style
Specialization in Two-Hander Style will do for the character: It teaches him
how to use the weapon much faster and more aggressively than someone with less
specialized training in the weapon.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>One-Handed Weapons Used Two-Handed
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Some players don't realize that many other one-handed weapons can also be used
two-handed. Since these weapons don't do any more damage two-handed, there
usually isn't much reason to use them this way; however, with Style Specialization
in Two-Hander Style, now there's a reason.
<P></P>
If you specialize in Two-Hander Style and then use a one-handed weapon in two
hands, you also get a bonus of +1 to damage. Thus, if you take a Two-Hander
Style Specialization, when using a long sword two-handed, you do 1d8+1 damage
instead of the base 1d8 (or 1d12+1 vs. large targets, instead of the base 1d12).
<P></P>
The one-handed weapons which can be used two-handed in this fashion include:
Battle axe, Club, Footman's flail, Footman's pick, Horseman's flail, Horseman's
mace, Horseman's pick, Morning star, Long sword, Warhammer.
