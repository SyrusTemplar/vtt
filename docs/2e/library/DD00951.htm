<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Gem of Brightness:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This crystal appears to be a long, rough prism. Upon utterance of the proper
spell words, however, the crystal emits bright light of one of three sorts.
<P></P>
One command word causes the gem to shed a pale light in a cone-shape 10 feet
long, emanating from the gem to a radius of 2? feet at the end of the beam. This
does not discharge any of the energy of the device.
<P></P>
Another command causes the <I>gem of brightness</I> to send out a very bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet long. Any
creature struck in the eyes by this beam will be dazzled and unable to see for 1d4
rounds. The target creature is entitled to a saving throw versus magic to
determine whether or not its eyes were shut or averted in time. This use of the gem
expends one energy charge.
<P></P>
The third manner in which the item may be used is to cause it to flare in a
blinding flash of light in a cone 30 feet long with a 5-foot radius at its end.
Although this glare lasts but a moment, all creatures within its area must save
versus magic or be blinded for 1-4 rounds and thereafter suffer a penalty of -1
to -4 to attack rolls due to permanent eye damage. This use expends five
charges.
<P></P>
Dazzling or blindness effects can be reversed by a <I>cure blindness</I> spell; eye damage can be cured only by a <I>heal</I> spell. The <I>gem of brightness</I> has 50 charges and cannot be recharged. A <I>darkness</I> spell cast at the gem's owner drains one charge from a <I>gem of brightness,</I> or makes it useless for one round, at the option of the gem owner. A <I>continual darkness</I> spell causes it to be useless for one day, or to expend five charges, at the
option of the owner.
<P></P>
