Combat Penalties
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Many critical strikes hamper the victim?s ability to fight or move by
penalizing his attack rolls or reducing his movement rate. A character with reduced
movement may not choose to charge, jog, run, sprint, or force-march in order to
compensate. A character reduced to no movement may still drag himself along with
an effective movement rating of 1 or ride a mount with difficulty.
<P></P>
A few critical strikes may prevent the victim from attacking at all; if this
is the case, the character may not engage in spellcasting or performing any
other actions except for using magical items or possibly using psionic powers that
affect only his own body.

automatic result; the victim may still attempt a saving throw vs. death magic to
remain on his feet.
