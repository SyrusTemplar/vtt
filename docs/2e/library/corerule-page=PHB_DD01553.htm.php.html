A weaponsmith is required to fashion arrowheads, but the bowyer/fletcher can
perform all other necessary functions. The construction time for a long or short
bow is one week, while composite bows require two weeks, and 1d6 arrows can be
made in one day.
<P></P>
When the construction time for the weapon is completed, the player makes a
proficiency check. If the check is successful, the weapon is of fine quality and
will last for many years of normal use without breaking. If the check fails, the
weapon is still usable, but has a limited life span: An arrow breaks on the
first shot; a bow breaks if the character using it rolls an unmodified 1 on his
1d20 attack roll.
<P></P>
<I>Option:</I> If a character wishes to create a weapon of truly fine quality and the DM
allows it, the player can opt to use the following alternative procedure for
determining the success of his attempt. When the proficiency check is made, any
failure means that the weapon is useless. However, a successful check means that
the weapon enables the character to add Strength bonuses to attack and damage
rolls. Additionally, if the proficiency check is a natural 1, the range of the bow
is increased 10 yards for all range classes or is of such fine work that it is
suitable for enchantment.
