When the <I>audible glamer</I> spell is cast, the wizard causes a volume of sound to arise, at whatever
distance he desires (within range), and seem to recede, approach, or remain at a
fixed place as desired. The volume of sound created, however, is directly related
to the level of the spellcaster. The volume is based upon the lowest level at
which the spell can be cast, 1st level. The noise of the <I>audible glamer</I> at this level is that of four men, maximum. Each additional experience level
of the wizard adds a like volume, so that at 2nd level the wizard can have the
spell cause sound equal to that of eight men. Thus, talking, singing, shouting,
walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The auditory illusion
created by an <I>audible glamer</I> spell can be virtually any type of sound, but the relative volume must be
commensurate with the level of the wizard casting the spell. A horde of rats
running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight men running and shouting. A
roaring lion is equal to the noise volume of 16 men, while a roaring dragon is
equal to the noise volume of no fewer than 24 men.
<P></P>
A character stating that he does not believe the sound receives a saving
throw, and if it succeeds, the character then hears a faint and obviously false
sound, emanating from the caster's direction. Note that this spell can enhance the
effectiveness of the <I>phantasmal force</I> spell.
<P></P>
The material component of the spell is a bit of wool or a small lump of wax.
