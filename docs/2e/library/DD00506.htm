Fighting on horseback (or on a wyvern, unicorn, or pegasus, or whatever) is a
different affair from battling on solid ground. The fighters must deal with
their mounts--unpredictable and sometimes skittish creatures. Plus, the business
of fighting on horseback demands different tactics from foot combat.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Mounts trained for combat (a heavy warhorse, for example) present few
problems. These can be used in mounted combat with no penalties. However, steeds not
trained for combat are easily frightened by the noise and confusion.
<P></P>
Those fighting from the back of untrained creatures suffer a -2 on their
chance to hit, since much of their time is spent simply trying to keep the mount
under control.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Panic:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The rider of an untrained mount must make a Riding proficiency check whenever
the mount is injured or startled by a surprising event (such as a<I> lightning bolt</I> spell blasting the rider or someone close by).
<P></P>
If the check fails, the mount panics and bolts, carrying its rider up to 1-1/2
times its normal move. Although the mount panics in a more or less random
direction, it goes generally forward unless that carries it straight into the face
of danger. If unable to flee, a panicked mount rears and bucks uncontrollably.
<P></P>
Characters without the Riding proficiency automatically lose control of a
panicked mount. A proficient character can attempt to regain control once per
round. Regardless of the rider's proficiency, the mount's panic lasts only 1d4
rounds.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> In mounted fighting, a character gets a +1 bonus to his chance to hit
creatures smaller than his mount. Thus, a man on horseback gains a +1 bonus to his
attack rolls against all medium-sized creatures such as other men, but would not
gain this bonus against another rider or a giant. Those on foot who fight against
a mounted rider, have a -1 penalty; this not applied to attacks against the
mount, however.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Lances</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> are the preferred weapons of the mounted rider. However, the type of lance
used (light, medium, or heavy) can't be greater than the size of the horse ridden
(light, medium, or heavy).
<P></P>
Medium and heavy lances gain their striking power from the momentum of the
mount. By themselves, these lances are not capable of doing significant damage.
Simply stabbing someone with a heavy lance won't produce much in the way of
results. Therefore, these weapons are most effective when there's plenty of attack
space.
<P></P>
During the first round of a battle, a rider can attack with a heavy or medium
lance. After this, however, the rider must break off (most likely by continuing
past his opponent), turn his mount, and gallop back again. This series of
actions takes one round. Thus, at best, a rider can attack with a lance once every
other round.
<P></P>
If the rider wants to continue the fight close in, he must throw the lance to
the ground and draw another weapon. Often, lances are used for the first attack
and then discarded in favor of swords, maces, etc.
<P></P>
Another consideration to bear in mind when using a lance is that lances are
breakable. Heavy and medium lances are relatively inflexible. The DM can make an
Item Saving Throw (for crushing blow) on each successful hit. A light lance is
made with a great deal of spring (bamboo or cane are common materials). An Item
Saving Throw is made only if the number needed to hit is rolled exactly, after
modifiers.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Missile fire</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">from the back of a moving horse is possible only if the rider is proficient in
horsemanship. Even then, only short bows, composite short bows, and light
crossbows can be fired from horseback by normally proficient characters.
<P></P>
Long bows can be used by those with specialization (if this is used). Heavy
crossbows can be fired once, but cannot be reloaded by a mounted man since the
bracing and pull is inadequate.
<P></P>
If the mount is not moving, the rider can fire normally (with full ROF and
chance to hit). When firing while on the move, the rider has his rate of fire
reduced by one. A 2-shot-per-turn ROF becomes a 1 shot every two turns; and so on.
<P></P>
In addition, the distance moved modifies the attack rolls according to <A HREF="DD00507.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00507.htm">Table 53</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> .

<A NAME="04fbe2a5"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Being Dismounted</B>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The other great hazard and difficulty of mounted combatants is the risk of
being abruptly and rather rudely dismounted. An opponent can make this happen in
one of several ways.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Killing the Mount:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This is the grim and efficient method. Once the horse (often an easier target)
is dead, the rider is certainly dismounted. The steed automatically falls to
the ground.
<P></P>
If the rider has the Riding proficiency, he can attempt to land safely on his
feet on a successful check. Otherwise, the character also falls to the ground
and suffers 1d3 points of damage. The character cannot take any action that
round and must spend another entire round gathering himself back up and getting to
his feet.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Lassoing the Rider:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The more heroic method of dismounting someone is to try to bring down the
rider without harming the mount. This is also more desirable from a bandit's point
of view, as he would rather have a live horse than a dead one.
<P></P>
Certain weapons (such as the lasso) can be used to yank a rider off his
speeding mount. However, riders with Riding proficiency can attempt to stop short,
reining the horse in before the rope is fully played out. If the check is
successful, the horse stops before the line goes taut. The rider remains mounted,
albeit still lassoed.
<P></P>
Whether the proficiency check is made or missed, the person or monster
wielding the lasso must make a Strength check with a +3 bonus for every size category
he's bigger than the rider (or a -3 penalty for every size category smaller).
<P></P>
A 20 is always a failure and a 1 always succeeds--unless the DM deems the
result utterly preposterous. If the check is successful, the roper remains standing
and the rider falls. If the check fails, the fellow on the ground gets yanked
down and possibly dragged along.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon Impact:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Riders also can be knocked off by solid blows from a variety of weapons. Any
time a rider hits another mounted character or creature with a melee weapon 3'
or longer and scores a natural 20 on the roll, the other character is knocked
from the saddle, suffering 1d3 points of damage (if from the back of a normal
horse).
<P></P>
Foot soldiers with weapons of 10' or greater have the same chance. Riders with
Riding proficiency can attempt to retain their seating by rolling a successful
proficiency check.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>The Flying Tackle:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Finally, those on horseback can attempt to dive on another rider by making an
attack roll.
<P></P>
If the attack roll misses, the attacker falls to the ground, suffering 1d3
points of damage (more, at the DM's discretion, if the mount is larger than a
horse).
<P></P>
If the attack roll succeeds, the target must roll a successful Dexterity check
to remain in the saddle. If this roll succeeds, the rider remains mounted, but
the attacker is hanging on his side, feet dangling just above the ground. If
the attack succeeds and the Dexterity roll is failed, both the rider and the
attacker fall to the ground.
<P></P>
Footsoldiers can also attempt to pull down a rider. This is handled by the
rules for overbearing.
