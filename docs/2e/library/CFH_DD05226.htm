</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> You can perform the Disarm maneuver with thrown weapons and missile weapons.
<P></P>
When throwing small (S) weapons, you suffer an additional ?2 attack penalty
because these weapons don't have a lot of weight; it's harder for them to knock
the weapon out of someone's hands. Medium (M) or larger weapons don't suffer
this penalty, nor do arrows, quarrels, or sling stones.
<P></P>
Thrown-weapon and missile Disarms may only be performed against single-hand
weapons. They automatically fail vs. two-hand weapons and shields.
