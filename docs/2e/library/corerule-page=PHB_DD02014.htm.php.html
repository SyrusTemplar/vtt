By means of this spell, the wizard surrounds himself with an invisible barrier
that moves with him. The space within this barrier is totally impervious to
all magic and magical spell effects, thus preventing the passage of spells or
their effects. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magical items or
spells within its confines. The area is also impervious to breath weapons, gaze or
voice attacks, and similar special attack forms.
<P></P>
The antimagic shell also hedges out charmed, summoned, or conjured creatures.
It cannot, however, be forced against any creature that it would keep at bay;
any attempt to do so creates a discernible pressure against the barrier, and
continued pressure will break the spell. Normal creatures (a normally encountered
troll rather than a conjured one, for instance) can enter the area, as can
normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magical sword does not function magically
within the area, it is still a sword. Note that creatures on their home plane are
normal creatures there. Thus, on the Elemental Plane of Fire, a randomly
encountered fire elemental cannot be kept at bay by this spell. Artifacts, relics,
and creatures of demigod or higher status are unaffected by mortal magic such as
this.
<P></P>
Should the caster be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, parts of
his person may be considered exposed, at the DM's option. A <I>dispel magic</I> spell does not remove the spell; the caster can end it upon command.
