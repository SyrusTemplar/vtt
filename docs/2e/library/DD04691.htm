The chain flail is a 6-foot length of weighted chain. In combat it is whirled
around very fast and swung at the enemy's legs. A character who is proficient
with a chain flail will use it to knock his opponent off balance. He must state
that he is attacking the legs, and rolls at -4 attack. If he succeeds, he rolls
for damage normally. In addition, his target must succeed in a Dexterity check
or be knocked to the ground by the chain's impact.
