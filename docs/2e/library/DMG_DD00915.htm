<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cloak of Arachnida:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This black garment gives the wearer the ability to climb as if a <I>spider climb</I> spell had been placed upon him. When magic is detected for, the cloak
radiates a strong aura of alteration magic.
<P></P>
In addition to the wall-climbing ability, the cloak grants the wearer immunity
to entrapment by webs of any sort?the wearer can actually move in webs at a
rate equal to that of the spider that created the web, or at a base movement rate
of 6 in other cases.
<P></P>
Once per day the wearer of this cloak can cast a double-sized <I>web.</I> This operates like the 2nd-level wizard spell.
<P></P>
Finally, the wearer is less subject to the poison of arachnids. He gains a +2
bonus to all saving throws vs. such poison.
