<P></P>
A wizard's vision can be permanently or temporarily impaired as a result of
blindness (magical or natural), disease, poison, or physical damage. Vision is
also impaired in darkness.
<P></P>
The ability to see is not crucial in the casting of many spells. For instance, <I>mirror image, monster summoning,</I> <I>tongues,</I> and <I>comprehend languages</I> (when used to translate spoken words) do not require the wizard to be looking
at anything in particular, and can therefore be cast with impaired vision.
However, spells such as <I>read magic, detect invisibility</I>, and <I>comprehend languages</I> (when used to translate written words) that require the wizard to be looking
at a particular object or location cannot be cast with impaired vision.
<P></P>
Impaired vision has no effect on spells the wizard casts on himself, such as <I>change self</I> or <I>armor</I>. Likewise, impaired vision has no effect when the wizard is attempting a
touch spell (such as <I>protection from evil</I>) on a willing subject, presuming the wizard is close enough to the subject to
touch him. However, if a wizard attempts to use a touch spell on an unwilling
subject, the wizard must make a successful attack roll with a -4 penalty (this
assumes that the wizard is close enough to his intended subject to touch him).
As with all attacks, the DM can modify this roll if the victim is unprepared
for the attack or is unaware of it. If the roll succeeds, the wizard touches the
subject and the normal spell effect occurs.
<P></P>
Spells that are cast on a specific person, place, or thing from a distance,
such as <I>charm person</I> or <I>magic missile</I>, cannot be cast by wizards with impaired vision. A wizard cannot simply blast
a <I>magic missile</I> in a general direction and hope for the best-- the spell does not operate
that way. Knowing the exact destination of these types of spells is a vital
element of their execution.
<P></P>
Spells that are cast over a general area can be cast by wizards with impaired
vision, although their effects may not be as precise as they would be if the
wizard could see. For instance, a wizard with impaired vision could cast <I>flaming sphere </I>in front of himself and direct it to move straight ahead toward an area where
he hears a group of screeching goblins. But if the goblins scatter at the
approach of the <I>flaming sphere</I>, the wizard will not be able to accurately direct its movement to run them
down.
<P></P>
This limitation also holds true for illusion spells that create illusionary
images, such as <I>phantasmal force</I>; at best, the illusionist is making a rough estimate as to the location of
his illusion, and any adjustments he makes to the illusion (such as moving it or
having it respond to the actions of other characters) is unlikely to be more
than an educated guess.
<P></P>
Additionally, the vision-impaired wizard is creating visual illusions from
memory, and the results might not always be as precise as they would be if the
wizard could see. In general, the more complex the illusion cast by a
vision-impaired wizard, the more easily the illusion will be disbelieved by an opponent;
the DM is free to add as much as a +4 bonus to the saving throws of opponents
attempting to disbelieve such illusions (see pages 81-82 of the <A HREF="PHB_DD01650.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01650.htm">Player's Handbook</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> for details on adjudicating illusions, and the section on illusions in
Chapter 7 of this book).
<P></P>
Vision-impaired wizards can use their familiars for information about their
surroundings, thus enabling them to cast spells with more accuracy and precision. <I>Wizard eye</I> and similar spells can help a vision-impaired wizard to &quot;see.&quot; <I>Infravision</I> is not always useful in these situations, since it works to enhance the
wizard's natural vision (although <I>infravision</I> helps if the wizard's vision is impaired because of darkness, and not because
of disease or damage). The non-weapon proficiency Blind Fighting is equally
ineffective for the vision-impaired wizard.
