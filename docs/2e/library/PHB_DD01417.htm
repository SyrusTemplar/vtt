You will need some sort of character record. TSR publishes character record
sheets that are quite handy and easy to use, but any sheet of paper will do.
Blank paper, lined paper, or even graph paper can be used. A double-sized sheet of
paper (11 ? 17 inches), folded in half, is excellent. Keep your character
record in pencil, because it will change frequently during the game. A good eraser
is also a must.

A full set of polyhedral dice is necessary. A full set consists of 4-, 6-, 8-,
10-, 12-, and 20-sided dice. A few extra 6- and 10-sided dice are a good idea.
Polyhedral dice should be available wherever you got this book.
<P></P>
Throughout these rules, the various dice are referred to by a code that is in
the form: # of dice, followed by ?d,? followed by a numeral for the type of
dice. In other words, if you are to roll one 6-sided die, you would see ?roll
1d6.? Five 12-sided dice are referred to as ?5d12.? (If you don't have five
12-sided dice, just roll one five times and add the results.)
<P></P>
When the rules say to roll ?percentile dice? or ?d100,? you need to generate a
random number from 1 to 100. One way to do this is to roll two 10-sided dice
of different colors. Before you roll, designate one die as the tens place and
the other as the ones place. Rolling them together enables you to generate a
number from 1 to 100 (a result of ?0? on both dice is read as ?00? or ?100?). For
example, if the blue die (representing the tens place) rolls an ?8? and the red
die (ones place) rolls a ?5,? the result is 85. Another, more expensive, way to
generate a number from 1 to 100 is to buy one of the dice that actually have
numbers from 1 to 100 on them.

At least one player should have a few sheets of graph paper for mapping the
group's progress. Assorted pieces of scratch paper are handy for making quick
notes, for passing secret messages to other players or the DM, or for keeping
track of odd bits of information that you don't want cluttering up your character
record.

Miniature figures are handy for keeping track of where everyone is in a
confusing situation like a battle. These can be as elaborate or simple as you like.
Some players use miniature lead or pewter figures painted to resemble their
characters. Plastic soldiers, chess pieces, boardgame pawns, dice, or bits of paper
can work just as well.
