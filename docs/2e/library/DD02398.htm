If the standard encumbrance rules aren?t worth the trouble, here?s an easier
way to do it. Most of the weight a character carries is in armor and weapons. To
streamline things, only use the character?s armor, shield, and largest weapon
when figuring the total weight carried. This slightly favors PCs, but it?s much
faster than tracking every addition of weight.

In <A HREF="DD02746.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02746.htm">Chapter Seven</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, armor is rated with a base encumbrance. This is the typical encumbrance
level of a human wearing that armor. For example, plate mail is rated as moderate
encumbrance, with a movement of 6 for a typical human. These default values make
it easy to eyeball NPC movement rates.

If you use the simplified encumbrance rule, make sure that it is not abused.
If the DM feels that a PC is taking advantage of this rule (for example,
carrying dozens of weapons or vast amounts of adventuring gear), he can insist on
using the more detailed accounting of the normal encumbrance rules.
