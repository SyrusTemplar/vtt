<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Javelin of Lightning:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A <I>javelin of lightning</I> is considered equal to a +2 magical weapon, although it has neither attack
nor damage bonuses. It has a range of 90 yards and whenever it strikes, the
javelin becomes the head of a 5-foot wide, 30-foot long stroke of lightning. Any
creature hit by the javelin suffers 1d6 points of damage, plus 20 points of
electrical damage. Any other creatures in the path of the stroke take either 10 or 20
points of damage, based on whether their saving throws are successful or not.
<P></P>
From 2-5 javelins will be found. The javelin is consumed in the lightning
discharge.
