<P></P>
Creatures with powerful weapon immunities should be used with care. Players
trust the DM to create situations in which they have a chance to win. Don't use
such creatures unless the party has weapons to defeat them, or there is some
other reason for encountering that monster.
<P></P>
Every player character in the party needn't have a weapon effective against
the monster, but there should be at least two in the party. Avoid making an
encounter dependent on the actions of a single character. It's not much fun for the
other players and too many things can go wrong with the plan if the key player
doesn't cooperate or his character gets hurt.
<P></P>
The warning above is just that, however--a warning. It's not a rule. There are
times where using such creatures on an unprepared party can lead to creative
and entertaining play.
<P></P>
For example, say the party is just beginning an adventure involving lots of
werewolves. Early on, they are attacked by a hairy creature and their weapons
don't seem to do any good! If not dispatched by spells, it causes serious injury,
but doesn't manage to kill anyone, before it flees for some reason or another.
It shouldn't take too much for players to figure out what they need, and
getting appropriate weapons can become part of the adventure.
<P></P>
Immune creatures also can be used to control a party that has become abusive
or just too powerful. Such uses of very potent creatures should be extremely
rare.
