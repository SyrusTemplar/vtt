This god is related to the god of sky and weather, but he is devoted only to
winds. Sailors, especially, pray to these gods, praying for good winds to take
them in the direction they wish to go. Wind-gods are playful and sometimes
malicious, and may choose to blow ships wildly off-course.
<P></P>
The priesthood of the god of winds makes these prayers for friendly winds, and
tries to make sure that the wind-god gets his due of worship; but these
priests otherwise are left much to their own devices, and many are adventurers and
hero-sailors.
<P></P>
Lesser wind-gods will be gods representing specific types of winds: The cold
north wind, the balmy southern wind, the terrifying typhoon or hurricane, the
incredibly destructive tornado.
<P></P>
Wind-gods are male.

The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Sky/Weather.
