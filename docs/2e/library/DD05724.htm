   Once a kit is chosen for a ranger, it can't be exchanged later in the game for
a different one. However, unless otherwise specified, it can be abandoned
entirely, the character continuing the game as a standard ranger; that is, a ranger
as described in the <I>Player's Handbook</I> without any of the benefits or hindrances associated with a particular kit.
<P></P>
   Why would a player want to abandon a kit? Maybe recent campaign events have
made the kit less fun to play (the king has declared amnesty for all Forest
Runners). Perhaps the player feels limited by the kit restrictions (he wants more
spells than those allowed to the Greenwood Ranger). Or maybe he's just tired of
it (the Sea Ranger is fed up with life on the water). Whatever the reason, the
DM should honor a player's request to abandon his kit. The abandonment may take
place gradually, if the DM's wishes to work the change into an adventure, or
immediately, if the DM doesn't see the change as significantly affecting the
story line of his campaign.

   A character who abandons a kit undergoes the following modifications:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> All of the kit's bonuses and benefits are lost. All penalties and hindrances
are ignored.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The character may use any weapons and armor normally available to the ranger.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Should the character acquire new weapon proficiency slots, they may be spent
on weapon proficiencies of the player's choice.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The nonweapon proficiencies associated with the kit, including requirements
and recommendations, no longer apply.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Bonus proficiencies <I>aren't </I>forfeited. Instead, they are set aside (written down but not used) until the
character acquires new nonweapon proficiency slots. The new slots must be spent
paying for the former bonus proficiencies, in an order determined by the
player. The player must pay for all former bonus proficiencies before he can choose
any new nonweapon proficiencies.
