This cycle is most likely to exist in campaigns which <I>don't</I> have gods of birth, death, fertility and rebirth. In campaigns which do
feature such gods, the forces of fertility and death are opposed, while in campaigns
where this cycle is the primary force, fertility and death are part of the
overall cycle. Therefore, if the DM has gods of death and fertility in his
campaign, he may not have this cycle; if he has this cycle, he may not have those gods.
<P></P>
Followers of this force believe that living things are born, live, and die,
and then reincarnate in a continuing cycle. Perhaps the cycle is endless; perhaps
its purpose is to give the soul of the living thing enough experience that he
can achieve a greater level of being.
<P></P>
In campaigns where this cycle does exist, it provides enough magical energy
for its priests to cast spells. The priests' duties include education of the
flock in the beliefs of the cycle, comforting the flock with the knowledge that
death is merely a point in the cycle and not the end, and protection of the world
from forces which might disrupt the cycle. Because undead beings have been
removed or removed themselves from this natural cycle, the priests are their sworn
enemies.
<P></P>
The priests of this force are on good terms with Druids and the priests of
Agriculture, Animals, Death, Earth, Fertility, Nature, Seasons, Sky/Weather, and
Vegetation.
