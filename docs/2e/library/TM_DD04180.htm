The use of an <I>alacrity</I> spell allows the wizard to speed up the casting of spells of 5th level and
lower. Only spells that are cast within the <I>alacrity</I> spell's duration are affected.
<P></P>
Casting times of 2-5 are reduced by 1; casting times of 6-9 are reduced by 2;
and a casting time of one round is reduced to a casting time of 8. Casting
times for spells which require more than 1 round are reduced by 20% (e.g., an <I>animate dead</I> spell affected by <I>alacrity</I> could be cast in only 4 rounds). Spells which have a casting time of 1 are
not affected by this spell.
<P></P>
The material component is a miniature hourglass which is destroyed when the
spell is cast.
