A thief campaign can probably run for a long time on the central conflict of
&quot;Haves vs. the Have-nots&quot;. Players and DMs alike will find a lot more flavor and
depth in a setting with a little broader background of conflict, however.
<P></P>
Conflicts appropriate to a thief campaign are little different from those that
should liven up any campaign. Every social setting will have tension between
the various legs of the power structure, whether these are ruling houses,
political parties, or even different members of the same ruling family.
<P></P>
Conflict between different classes or social strata is another common point of
tension in society. The rich might seek to dominate the poorer folk, who
strive in their own right to gain a share of the good life. In a mercantile society
there might be a middle class of merchants and artisans who seek to insulate
their privileges from those less fortunate, while at the same time striving for
financial betterment for themselves and their families.
<P></P>
Religious conflict is a common feature of campaigns, particularly appropriate
in worlds with a wide pantheon of varied gods. Thieves and others can often be
employed by the clerics of different temples in order to spy upon, pilfer, or
sabotage the centers of rival religions.
<P></P>
Conflicts among thieves themselves, and obviously between the law and breakers
of the law, should be standard features of the campaign. The conflict between
a thieves' guild and independent (usually player character) thieves has become
a cliche, but it still creates a tense background for a thief's activities.
Just try to establish that this is not the only conflict around which the campaign
is based.
<P></P>
Conflicts, as always, are most effective when they can be personalized. In a
religious conflict, for example, detail the influential clerics on each side. If
a thief PC encounters a challenge from an NPC thief working in the same
territory, give that NPC a face and a personality. When conflicts are personalized,
player characters develop a natural motivation and enthusiasm for their
resolution.
