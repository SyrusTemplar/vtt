When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to confound any attempt to scry
(by means of either a spell or a magical device) any point within the area of
effect of the spell. To use the spell, he must be aware of the scrying attempt,
although knowledge of the scryer or the scryer's location is not necessary. Upon
casting the spell, the caster and all he desires within the radius of the spell
become undetectable to the scrying. Furthermore, the caster is able to send
whatever message he desires, including vision and sound, according to the medium
of the scrying method. To do this, the caster must concentrate on the message
he is sending. Once concentration is broken, no further images can be sent,
although the caster remains undetectable for the duration of the spell.

The material component for this spell is the ground dust of an emerald worth
at least 500 gp, which is sprinkled into the air when the spell is cast.
