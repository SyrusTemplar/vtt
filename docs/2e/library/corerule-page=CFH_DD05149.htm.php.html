<B>Description:</B> The Swashbuckler is the sophisticated, witty, lightly armed and armored hero
in a sophisticated city-based campaign—a la <I>The Three Musketeers</I>. He's fully capable of putting on heavy armor, picking up a bastard sword,
and soldiering alongside other tank warriors—but he shines in comparison when the
heroes are adventuring in the city, in light armor and with light weapons.
<P></P>
To be a Swashbuckler, a character must have an Intelligence and Dexterity of
13 or better.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> In a campaign, the Swashbuckler is the happy-go-lucky hero with the ready wit
and the flashing rapier. He's happiest when he's in the big city, but can be
an imposing warrior anywhere—enemies often underestimate him because of his
charming manners and don't realize that he can plate on armor and wield heavy
weapons as well as anyone else. The Swashbuckler, because he's bright and
well-spoken, often becomes party leader . . . or at least the leader's spokesman.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> The Swashbuckler can choose his own Secondary Skill. Good choices include:
Navigator (if he's in with a band of pirates, especially), Gambler, Jeweler,
Scribe, and Weaponsmith.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> The Swashbuckler receives two extra weapon proficiency slots which must be
devoted to weapon proficiency with one of the following weapons: stiletto*,
main-gauche*, rapier*, and sabre*. (The &quot;*&quot; symbol denotes new weapons to be found
in the <I>Equipment</I> chapter.) Throughout his career, he must devote half of his weapon
proficiency slots to those four weapons. Once he has achieved proficiency in all four of
those weapons, he may freely choose where the rest of his weapon proficiency
slots go.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Bonus Proficiencies: (General) Etiquette, (Rogue) Tumbling. Recommended:
(General) Artistic Ability, Dancing, Heraldry, Languages (Modern), Riding
(Land-Based), Seamanship, (Warrior) Blind-Fighting, Gaming, (Priest, double slots unless
Paladin) Musical Instrument, Reading/Writing, (Rogue) Appraising, Disguise,
Forgery, Juggling, Musical Instrument, Tightrope Walking, (Wizard, double slots
unless Ranger) Reading/Writing.
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> The Swashbuckler must buy the weapon in which he has specialized, but except
for that limitation may spend his gold precisely as he pleases.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> The Swashbuckler has three special benefits. First, when using up his
Nonweapon Proficiency slots, he doesn't have to devote double the normal number of
slots when choosing Rogue proficiencies. Second, when he's wearing light or no
armor (i.e., no armor, leather armor, or padded armor), he receives a –2 bonus to
his AC (that is, an AC of 7 would become a 5); he's so nimble that he's very
hard to hit. Third, the Swashbuckler is such a romantic figure that he always
receives a +2 adjustment on his reaction roll from NPC members of the opposite sex.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> Trouble seeks out the Swashbuckler. This is something that the DM will have
to play very carefully if the Swashbuckler is to be as hindered as all the other
Warrior Kits. When there's another Swashbuckler around, intent on proving that
he's the best swordsman in the world, it's the PC Swashbuckler he settles upon
and challenges. When a certain young lady is being pursued by the king's
guards, who are intent on stopping her from revealing secrets in her possession, it
is the Swashbuckler she stumbles across when fleeing. When a prince is too
drunk to attend his own coronation, miraculously he looks just like the
Swashbuckler. Life conspires to make things difficult for the Swashbuckler, and the DM
should always throw just a little more good-natured bad luck at that Warrior Kit
than at any other.
<P></P>
<B>Wealth Options:</B> The Swashbuckler receives the standard 5d4x10 gp starting money allotment.
<P></P>
<B>Races:</B> Any demihuman who'd look elegant in foppish dress, wielding a narrow blade,
will work fine as a Swashbuckler, especially elves, half-elves and halflings.
Dwarves and gnomes are not entirely inappropriate, but are likely to have to
defend themselves from plenty of jokes at the expense of their curious looks.
