Along with character classes and levels comes the natural tendency to classify
campaigns according to the level of the characters. Experienced players speak
of &quot;low-level&quot; or &quot;high-level&quot; games in different terms and, indeed, such games
are different from one another. Also differing from game to game, however, is
the definition of high level.
