<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Crystal Hypnosis Ball:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This cursed item is indistinguishable from a normal <I>crystal ball,</I> and it radiates magic, but not evil, if detected for. Any wizard attempting
to use it will become hypnotized, and a telepathic <I>suggestion</I> will be implanted in his mind.
<P></P>
The user of the device will believe that the desired object was viewed, but
actually he came partially under the influence of a powerful wizard, lich, or
even some power/being from another plane. Each further use brings the <I>crystal ball</I> gazer more under the influence of the creature, either as a servant or tool.
The DM decides whether to make this a gradual or sudden affair according to the
surroundings and circumstances peculiar to the finding of the <I>crystal hypnosis ball</I> and the character(s) locating it.
<P></P>
