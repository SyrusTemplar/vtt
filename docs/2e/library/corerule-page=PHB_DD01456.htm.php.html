</B>After choosing your character's race, you select his character class. A
character class is like a profession or career. It is what your character has worked
and trained at during his younger years. If you wanted to become a doctor, you
could not walk out the door and begin work immediately. First you would have to
get some training. The same is true of character classes in the AD&amp;D game.
Your character is assumed to have some previous training and guidance before
beginning his adventuring career. Now, armed with a little knowledge, your character
is ready to make his name and fortune.
<P></P>
<P></P>
The character classes are divided into four groups according to general
occupations: warrior, wizard, priest, and rogue. Within each group are several
similar character classes. All classes within a group share the same Hit Dice, as
well as combat and saving throw progressions. Each character class within a group
has different special powers and abilities that are available only to that
class. Each player must select a group for his character, then a specific class
within that group.

Fighter, mage, cleric, and thief are the standard classes. They are historical
and legendary archetypes that are common to many different cultures. Thus,
they are appropriate to any sort of AD&amp;D game campaign. All of the other classes
are optional. Your DM may decide that one or more of the optional classes are
not appropriate to his campaign setting. Check with your DM before selecting an
optional character class.
<P></P>
To help you choose your character's class, each group and its subordinate
classes are described briefly. The groups and classes are described in detail later
in this chapter.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Warrior:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There are three different classes within the warrior group: fighter, paladin,
and ranger. All are well-trained in the use of weapons and skilled in the
martial arts.
<P></P>
The <I>fighter</I> is a champion, swordsman, soldier, and brawler. He lives or dies by his
knowledge of weapons and tactics. Fighters can be found at the front of any battle,
contesting toe-to-toe with monsters and villains. A good fighter needs to be
strong and healthy if he hopes to survive.
<P></P>
The <I>paladin</I> is a warrior bold and pure, the exemplar of everything good and true. Like
the fighter, the paladin is a man of combat. However, the paladin lives for the
ideals of righteousness, justice, honesty, piety, and chivalry. He strives to be
a living example of these virtues so that others might learn from him as well
as gain by his actions.
<P></P>
The <I>ranger</I> is a warrior and a woodsman. He is skilled with weapons and is knowledgeable
in tracking and woodcraft. The ranger often protects and guides lost travelers
and honest peasant-folk. A ranger needs to be strong and wise to the ways of
nature to live a full life.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wizard:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The wizard strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping them and
casting them as spells. To do so, he studies strange tongues and obscure facts and
devotes much of his time to magical research.
<P></P>
A wizard must rely on knowledge and wit to survive. Wizards are rarely seen
adventuring without a retinue of fighters and men-at-arms.
<P></P>
Because there are different types (or schools) of magic, there are different
types of wizards. The <I>mage</I> studies all types of magic and learns a wide variety of spells. His broad
range makes him well suited to the demands of adventuring. The <I>illusionist</I> is an example of how a wizard can specialize in a particular school of magic,
illusion in this case.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Priest:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A priest sees to the spiritual needs of a community or location. Two types of
priests--clerics and druids--are described in the <I>Player's Handbook.</I> Other types can be created by the DM to suit specific campaigns.
<P></P>
The <I>cleric</I> is a generic priest (of any mythos) who tends to the needs of a community. He
is both protector and healer. He is not purely defensive, however. When evil
threatens, the cleric is well-suited to seek it out on its own ground and
destroy it.
<P></P>
The <I>druid</I> class is optional; it is an example of how the priest can be adapted to a
certain type of setting. The druid serves the cause of nature and neutrality; the
wilderness is his community. He uses his special powers to protect it and to
preserve balance in the world.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Rogue:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The rogue can be found throughout the world, wherever people gather and money
changes hands. While many rogues are motivated only by a desire to amass
fortune in the easiest way possible, some rogues have noble aims; they use their
skills to correct injustice, spread good will, or contribute to the success of an
adventuring group.
<P></P>
There are two types of rogues: thieves and bards.
<P></P>
To accomplish his goals, for good or ill, the <I>thief</I> is a skilled pilferer. Cunning, nimbleness, and stealth are his hallmarks.
Whether he turns his talent against innocent passers-by and wealthy merchants or
oppressors and monsters is a choice for the thief to make.
<P></P>
The <I>bard</I> is also a rogue, but he is very different from the thief. His strength is his
pleasant and charming personality. With it and his wits he makes his way
through the world. A bard is a talented musician and a walking storehouse of gossip,
tall tales, and lore. He learns a little bit about everything that crosses his
path; he is a jack-of-all-trades but master of none. While many bards are
scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere.
