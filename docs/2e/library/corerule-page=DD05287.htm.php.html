</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> As you know, damage from Punching, Martial Arts, and the Sap maneuver is 25%
normal and 75% temporary.
<P></P>
This means, whenever a character is sustaining damage from one of these
attacks, he must calculate which portion of it is normal, &quot;permanent&quot; damage, which
must be healed by magic or by medicine, and which portion is temporary, which
will wear off after a while.
