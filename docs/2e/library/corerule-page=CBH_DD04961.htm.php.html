<B>Specialty:</B> Viking Poet/Warrior.

<B>Qualifications:</B> Standard ability scores. Dwarves can advance up to the 12th level as Skalds.
<P></P>
<B>Introduction:
<P></P>
</B> I'm Herak the Skald
<P></P>
and I am quite bald,
<P></P>
but I have lots of gold,
<P></P>
as I am quite bold.
<P></P>
<I>It needs a little work, but I can get to that latter. Welcome! Come in by the
fire and I'll tell you a bit about my clan.
<P></P>
Being a Viking, I'm a great warrior and belong to the mightiest clan of
raiders ever assembled. When we go on our great forays, it is I, Herak, who records
our deeds for all to hear. But that is only part of my role as a Skald. When
combat is fierce, I often chant one of the great war songs of my forefathers.
These songs have great power, and more than once have I turned the tide of battle
in our favor.
<P></P>
When my clan isn't at war or on a raid, I work on ballads, poems, and chants.
It is our tradition that the clan's elder Skald pass on those songs that
establish the clan's worth to the upcoming Skalds. To these are added the greatest
tales of the current clansmen. In this way, all our descendants will know how
great they are. They can retell these tales, sing the ballads, and thus establish
their place among the clans.
<P></P>
Being a Skald is a wonderful life. There is nothing to match rowing a longboat
across a mist-shrouded bay early in the morning, in preparation for a raid on
some enemy village. Everyone is silent, the only sound is the creaking of oars
and soft slap of the water, and you can hear the chatter of teeth due to the
cold and nerves. We eventually slip up onto land, enter the village, then I shout
out a mighty chant and the fun begins.
<P></P>
</I> <B>Description:</B> Skalds are honored and respected members of their clans. These great poets
memorize the feats of each raid and battle, setting them down in the form of
poetry.
<P></P>
Every war party loves to have a Skald in its midst. This assures that their
great deeds and mighty skills will be honored in the Skald's next recital, and
thereafter immortalized for all time. Members of most bands treat Skalds with
utmost respect and courtesy. It is well known that the foolish warrior who maligns
a Skald will soon hear his name slandered in innumerable ballads across the
land.
<P></P>
Poems are the form in which Skalds honor others and themselves. Poems are also
used to relate the oral history of the clan. Significant ballads are passed
down from one generation to another via the Skald's talents. In this way, the
lessons and deeds of the past are related to those of the present so they can be
passed into the future.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> Skalds are often supported and protected by clan nobles and kings who love to
hear of great duels and mighty wars. When events are unfolded in the form of
poetry, it makes the telling all the more inspiring. Such men would hear Skalds
relate tales of their family's glory to visitors.
<P></P>
Skalds rarely perform together unless they have entered into a poetic duel.
<P></P>
Adventuring Skalds are common. Every Skald is easily caught up in the fervor
and majesty of adventure, danger, and combat. Great quests also serve as source
material for their ballads and poems.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> Armorer, Bowyer/Fletcher, Hunter, Leather worker, Weaponsmith.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> An initial proficiency slot must be spent on either the broad sword, hand
axe, battle axe, or spear. At least half of the Skald's weapon proficiencies must
be spent on these weapons (until they are all selected).
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonuses:</I> Ancient History, Local History, Poetry, Singing. <I>Suggested:</I> Armorer, Blacksmithing, Blind-fighting, Bowyer/Fletcher, Crowd Working,
Etiquette, Hunting, Leatherworking, Musical Instrument, Weaponsmithing.
<P></P>
See &quot;Special Hindrances&quot; concerning the reading/writing proficiency.
<P></P>
<B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Skalds lean toward warrior skills more than most bards. Because of this, they
can wear any form of armor up to bronze plate, and they can even use shields.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B>
<P></P>
<I>War Chant: </I>By chanting a war song, a Skald can inspire allies as they go forward into
combat. For the chant to have an effect, the Skald must begin chanting at least
three rounds before combat begins, otherwise his allies are too caught up in the
events about them to benefit from this ability.
<P></P>
Such chanting has an effective range of ten feet per level of the Skald. The
effects end as soon as the Skald receives his first wound. If the Skald does not
enter the fray (and avoids being wounded), the effects end in a number of
rounds equal to the Skald's level.
<P></P>
At 1st level, the Skald can choose only one of the following six effects per
battle; at 3rd level two effects are chosen, three at 6th, four at 9th, <I>etc</I>. The Skald player chooses the effects, and can change them from one battle to
the next.
<P></P>
Chanting can elevate spirits, remove concerns about danger, keep men's minds
focused on combat, and fill friendly forces with a sense of being larger than
life. Translated into game terms, this results in the following six possible
effects for the members of the Skald's party:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Bonus hit points equal to the Skald's Hit Dice.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> A morale bonus of 1 for every six levels of the Skald (rounded up).
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> A +1 bonus to all attack rolls.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> A +1 bonus to all damage rolls.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> A +1 bonus to all saving throws.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> A -1 bonus to everyone's Armor Class.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Influence Reactions:</I> If a Skald spends 1d10 rounds singing ballads, he can attempt to improve the
reactions of an audience. Everyone able to clearly hear and understand the
Skald must roll a saving throw vs. paralyzation with a -1 penalty per three levels
of the Skald. Those who fail have their reactions to the Skald improved by one
level. Those who succeed do not find the Skald's ballad to be particularly
moving. Those who succeed on a natural 20 find the song to be offensive and their
reactions worsen one level.
<P></P>
<I>Battle Chant:</I> Skalds are a bit more combative than most bards. This provides them with
certain combat advantages. The Skald fights with a +1 attack roll bonus any time he
is singing or chanting during combat, even a soft chant under his breath. In
addition, the Skald gains a +1 damage bonus when using a broadsword, axe (any
type), or spear while he is chanting, provided that he has proficiency with the
weapon. These bonuses almost always apply, unless the bard is silenced, under
water, <I>etc</I>.
<P></P>
<I>Legend Lore:</I> Skalds love legends about war and combat. Legend lore works the same for
Skalds as it does for True Bards, except that Skalds can perform legend lore only
upon magical items having to do with war or combat (<I>e.g.,</I> weapons, armor,<I> strength potions, etc.</I>).
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B><I> The</I> Skald's society does not have a written language. Because of this, Skalds
cannot take the reading/writing proficiency when created. Furthermore, they do not
get the read languages ability at 3rd level if they stay in their home
society. However, both of these limits are lifted once the Skald comes into contact
with a culture that reads and writes. He can then pick up the reading/writing
proficiency at twice the normal cost and gains the read languages ability at a 0%
base (<I>i.e.,</I> he must put points into the skill or he has a zero chance for success).
<P></P>
Skalds do not gain the use any written magical item ability at 10th level.
<P></P>
Spells are also nearly unknown in the Skald's society, and they are viewed
with suspicion in any event. Thus, Skalds cannot learn any spells until they
encounter a spellcasting culture. Once contact has been made, the Skald can begin
casting spells when he gains his next level. At this time he is considered a
2nd-level spellcaster (providing he is at least 3rd level by this time). His
spellcasting level increases by 1 every time he gains a level thereafter.
<P></P>
If your campaign does not have a Viking culture, but a player still wishes to
play a Skald, assume that the character left his distant homeland and has
journeyed to the existing campaign setting. This character can take reading/writing
proficiency when he gains his next level, provided he has the proficiency slots
available. He gains the ability to cast spells as outlined above.
<P></P>
<B>Notes:</B> The <I>Vikings Campaign Sourcebook</I> is a good resource to be used in conjunction with Skald bards.
