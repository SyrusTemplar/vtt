This spell causes confusion in one or more creatures within the area, creating
indecision and the inability to take effective action. The spell affects 1d4
creatures, plus one creature per two caster levels. Thus, seven to ten creatures
can be affected by a 12th- or 13th-level caster, eight to 11 by a 14th- or
15th-level caster, etc. These creatures are allowed saving throws vs. spell with
-2 penalties, adjusted for Wisdom. Those successfully saving are unaffected by
the spell. Confused creatures react as follows (roll 1d10):

The spell lasts one round for each level of the caster. Those who fail their
saving throws are checked by the DM for actions each round, for the duration of
the spell, or until the ?wander away for the duration of the spell? result
occurs.
<P></P>
Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible in their most
typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). This is not
panicked flight. Wandering creatures also have a 50% chance of using any
special innate movement abilities (plane shift, burrowing, flight, etc.). Saving
throws and actions are checked at the beginning of each round. Any confused
creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its
basic nature.

The material component of this spell is a set of three nut shells.

Note: If there are many creatures involved, the DM may decide to assume
average results. For example, if there are 16 orcs affected and 25% could be expected
to successfully roll the saving throw, then four are assumed to have
succeeded, one wanders away, four attack the nearest creature, six stand confused and
the last acts normally but must check next round. Since the orcs are not near the
party, the DM decides that two who are supposed to attack the nearest creature
attack each other, one attacks an orc that saved, and one attacks a confused
orc, which strikes back. The next round, the base is 11 orcs, since four
originally saved and one wandered off. Another one wanders off, five stands confused,
four attack, and one acts normally.
