The basic encumbrance rule gives general categories of encumbrance but does
not allow for fine distinctions. Some players and DMs may take exception to the
idea that adding one more pound to a character suddenly shifts that character to
the next (and drastically worse) encumbrance category. They may want to use
the following optional table; <A HREF="DD01640.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01640.htm">Table 48</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> reduces a character's movement rating 1 factor at a time.
<P></P>
To determine your character's movement rate (see “<A HREF="DD01774.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01774.htm">Movement</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">” in Chapter 14: Time and Movement) for a given load, find the row on Table 48
with his Strength score. Read across it until you find the first column in
which the number of pounds listed is <I>greater</I> than your character's current load. At the top of that column are two rows
for base movement rates. Characters with a base movement rate of 12 use the top
row; those with a base movement rate of 6 use the bottom row. The number in the
appropriate upper row is your character's modified movement rate.

<I> Tarus (a human with a base movement of 12) has a Strength of 17 and is
carrying a 140-pound load. Looking across on the 17 rows shows that 140 falls between
133 and 145 on the table. Looking at the top of the 145 column shows that Tarus
has a modified movement rate of 7. He can carry five more pounds of gear
(total 145 pounds) and maintain his speed, or drop seven pounds of equipment (to 133
pounds) and increase his speed to 8.
