Spell Components: Yes or No?
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> One of the optional rules presented in the <A HREF="PHB_DD01653.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01653.htm">Player’s Handbook</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>is the use of spell components. You are free to decide to use or ignore
components in your own campaign; as long as the NPCs abide by the same rules and
restrictions the players do, the game works equally well in either case. The real
crux of this issue are material components, and whether or not players should
have to keep track of their stocks of spell reagents.
<P></P>
There are some very good reasons why you shouldn’t use material components in
play; it requires a great attention to detail and some honesty on the part of
the players, and may create obstacles or difficulties that take away from the
DM’s plot. After all, if the party’s wizard has to drop out of the epic adventure
in mid-stride to track down the ingredients for his next <I>fireball </I>spell, all concerned may feel a little frustrated or annoyed.
<P></P>
On the other hand, using spell components and requiring an account of what the
wizard has on his person and what he has stockpiled in his laboratory or home
base can add another dimension of detail and pseudo-realism to the game. If
spell components aren’t used, who cares if a wizard is down to his last three
coppers? More than any other class, a wizard can operate with no concern for
material wealth— unless he has to worry about whether or not he can afford to buy the
materials he’ll need to be able to cast his spells. In addition, the use of
spell components requires players to spend some time and effort thinking about
situations their characters would certainly be dealing with and can enhance
role-playing if it isn’t taken to extremes.
<P></P>
Generally, enforcing the requirements for material components works best for
low- to mid-level characters. By the time a wizard is 8th or 9th level, he’s
usually wealthy enough to easily buy any materials he needs, and his daily
selection of spells is so broad that keeping track of each type of component carried
becomes a logistical nightmare. By that time, the DM can allow the player a
little slack; the wizard’s a mighty hero now, and both player and DM may have other
arenas of role-playing (building laboratories or establishing strongholds)
that the character will be graduating to. However, at low levels, wizards and
priests will find that some of their favorite spells have to be saved for when
they’re truly needed.
<P></P>
For example, low-level wizards often rely on the <I>armor </I>spell as their sole means of defense against physical attack. <I>Armor </I>requires a piece of leather—no problem there—that has been <I>blessed </I>by a priest. Referring to <A HREF="DMG_DD00602.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00602.htm">Table 69</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : NPC Spell Costs in the <I>DMG</I>, bless is usually reserved for characters of the same faith as the casting
priest, and even then a small sum might be required. So, the wizard who wants the
piece of leather <I>blessed </I>for his spell might have to convert to the faith of nearest available priest,
and tithe him 10 or 20 gp to boot! If you consider how often players simply
say, “Oh yeah, I’ll cast <I>armor </I>the day before we leave, so I’ll have my 1st-level spell open and <I>armor </I>in effect,” you can see just how much hassle (and role-playing opportunities!)
are ignored by the player and DM.
