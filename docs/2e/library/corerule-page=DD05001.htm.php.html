Although a degree in music isn't required to play a bard character, it often
increases realism if such players know a few basics. This way they can role-play
their characters with an air of authority, understanding, and authenticity.
For this reason, a few common terms associated with many forms of music are
defined below. By briefly studying this mini-glossary, you can breathe some new life
into the vocabulary of your bard.
