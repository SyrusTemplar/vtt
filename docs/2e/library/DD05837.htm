This is a major advantage for a thieves' guild member. It goes without saying
that many items of use to a thief are hardly available on the open market in
almost any society! Armor and weapons can be had, and likewise straightforward
items such as ropes, iron spikes, crowbars, and the like. But where does the
thief get lockpicks, tiger's claws, razor rings, silenced armor, and suchlike?
From the thieves' guild, of course.

In addition to being a source of equipment for sale (and possibly even for
loan), here is an obvious chance for role-playing possibilities. The &quot;blueprint
profile&quot; for the Thieves Quartermaster (later in this chapter) shows how a simple
trip to buy some new lockpicks at the guild can be turned into an encounter
with a very resourceful and entertaining NPC, one the player of the thief PC
won't forget!

In some powerful guilds, magical items may be available for exchange (for
other magical items, obviously ones of superior value!) or even possibly for loan
(with a fat deposit securing the item). Loaning allows thief PCs to enjoy having
a magical item without the DM letting them have it permanently! It should go
without saying that absconding with the item will lead to relentless and
murderous pursuits until the item is returned.
