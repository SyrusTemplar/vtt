<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Bell's Palette of Identity:</B> This device offers protection against <I>polymorph</I> spells and other magical effects that change a person's physical appearance.
<P></P>
The item is an artist's palette covered with bright, mystical paints. To use
the item, a person must paint a self-portrait. The painting does not need to be
created with any expertise, but the painter must believe that the portrait is
accurate.
<P></P>
Any time a character carries his self-portrait on his person, the portrait
suffers the effects of unsuccessful saving throws for him when <I>massmorph, polymorph other, polymorph any object</I>, or <I>seeming</I> spells are cast on him. The portrait also suffers the effects if a character
steps in front of a <I>mirror of simple order</I>.
<P></P>
The character's saving throw is made normally. If successful, the spell simply
fails. If the saving throw is unsuccessful, the portrait is altered,
reflecting the effect of the spell, but the character is unharmed. Once the portrait
suffers these effects, it no longer can offer protection for the person it
represents.
<P></P>
A person on the plane of Hades carrying a picture made from <I>Bell's palette of identity</I> is protected from the effects of fading on this plane. It is the picture that
slowly fades to grey while the person retains all of his color. After two
weeks in Hades, a character makes a saving throw against being trapped in Hades. If
the saving throw is unsuccessful, the portrait becomes useless to the person
who painted it.
<P></P>
There is always a risk that some denizen of Hades will discover a baneful use
for a discarded painting. Travelers are wise not to leave such personal effects
behind on this plane.
<P></P>
A single <I>Bell's palette of identity</I> can be used to paint 2-5 portraits.
