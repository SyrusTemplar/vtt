silver-blue, is the patron of gnomish smiths--not just blacksmiths but also
goldsmiths, silversmiths, and all other workers in metal. He is physically the strongest
of the gnomish gods, and his uncanny ability to sniff of the veins of metal
that thread through the earth makes him a patron of miners.
