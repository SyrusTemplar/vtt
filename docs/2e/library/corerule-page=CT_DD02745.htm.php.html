</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Generally, a character may apply his Strength bonuses to any weapon powered by
his own muscle. Any hand-held weapon used to slash, bludgeon, or thrust at an
enemy certainly counts, but weapons that don’t inflict damage or don’t have a
type don’t allow a character to use his attack bonuses. For example, a
character’s Strength has no effect on the use of a lasso or net.
<P></P>
Characters may use their reaction adjustment for high Dexterity when throwing
or firing any kind of missile weapon. However, they do not use their Strength
bonuses unless the weapon is thrown and complies with the conditions above.
Firearms, bows, slings, and crossbows are not normally affected by a character’s
Strength.

Bows can be made to take advantage of a character’s Strength bonuses, but must
be custom-made. Refer to Chapter 6: Money and Equipment in the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01630.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01630.htm.php.html">Player’s Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">.

<B>The 16th-level Dart Specialist: </B>It’s ludicrous to allow a high-Strength character the full benefit of his
muscular power if he insists on using tiny little weapons such as darts. A good way
to address this kind of min-maxing is to limit the damage bonus granted by
high Strength to the maximum roll of the weapon’s base damage. A dart normally
causes 1d3 points of damage against size M targets, so a character with
exceptional Strength could gain a total of +3 to his dart’s damage—but no more, even if
he is normally entitled to a damage bonus of +4 or more.
