The <I>mass suggestion</I> spell enables the wizard to influence the actions of one or more chosen
creatures in the same way as the <I>suggestion</I> spell. Up to one creature per experience level of the caster can be
influenced, provided that all subject creatures are within the 30-yard range. Undead are
not subject to this spell. The suggestion must be reasonably worded and
understood by the creatures, and must be the same for all hearing it. Creatures
successfully saving vs. spell are unaffected. Saving throws against the spell suffer
a penalty of -1, and if a single creature is to be affected, its saving throw
suffers a -4 penalty. Note that a very reasonable mass suggestion can cause the
saving throw to be made with an additional penalty (such as -1, -2, etc.), at
the discretion of your DM. A mass suggestion can continue in effect for a
considerable duration, at the DM's discretion. Conditions that will trigger a
special action can also be specified; if the condition is not met before the spell
expires, the action will not be performed.

The material components of this spell are a snake's tongue and either a bit of
honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil.
