The DM knows when a planned encounter is to occur, based on the conditions or
location he has prepared. The same is not true of random encounters. For these,
the DM must make encounter checks.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Frequency of Encounter Checks:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">How often the DM makes encounter checks depends on the situation. Different
types of terrain (or dungeons) may make checks more or less frequent.
Furthermore, the type of terrain and population density will affect the chance the
characters have a meaningful encounter. <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD00556.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD00556.htm.php.html">Table 56</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> lists both the frequency of checks and the chance that an encounter will
occur for the most common wilderness situations. If characters are adventuring in
other types of terrain, the DM can use a comparable entry from the table or can
determine frequency and chance of encounter himself.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Encounter Chance:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This lists the number or less that must be rolled on 1d10 for an encounter to
occur.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Time of Day:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">If an x appears under a specific time of day, an encounter check should be
made. This does not ensure an encounter, it only requires the check for one.
<P></P>
The chance of having an encounter can be modified by several factors. Foremost
of these is population density. The chances of an encounter listed on <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD00556.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD00556.htm.php.html">Table 56</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> assume an unpopulated wilderness area.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wilderness Checks:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">If the region is patrolled or sparsely settled, the chance of an encounter
increases by one. In heavily populated areas, the chance of an encounter increases
by two. These modifiers should not be used unless the DM has specially
prepared encounter tables to reflect the differences between settled lands and
wilderness, however.
<P></P>
The DM can also choose to modify the chance of an encounter for any other
reason he feels is justified. If the characters have been making excessive noise or
if the village alarm has been sounded, the DM can increase the chance of an
encounter. The DM can even decide arbitrarily that an encounter will occur,
although it can hardly be considered random any more.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Dungeon Checks:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Encounter checks in the dungeon are not affected by terrain (since there isn't
really any terrain to consider). Normally, one encounter check is made every
hour, with an encounter occurring on a roll of 1 on 1d10.
<P></P>
If the DM deems part of a dungeon particularly dangerous, the number of checks
can be increased to once per turn (10 minutes of game time). The DM can also
increase the chance of an encounter occurring. If the characters engage in an
activity that makes excessive noise (hammering spikes or taking part in a loud
battle), an encounter check should be made immediately.
