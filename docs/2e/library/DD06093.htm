The<I> Player's Handbook</I> lists eight different greater schools of magic, but more are possible.
Additional schools can expand a player's options, add color to the campaign, and
allow the DM to put his own mark on the game. Designing new magic schools is one
of the DM's toughest jobs, but it can also be one of the most rewarding.
<P></P>
This chapter presents a step-by-step procedure for creating schools of magic
from scratch. We'll demonstrate the process by creating a brand new school right
before your eyes the school of metamorphics.

At the end of this book is a blank planning sheet. This may be copied to help
you design your own new schools
