<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Even newly created, 1st-level characters have proficiencies. The number of
proficiency slots that a character starts with is determined by his group, as
shown in <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01524.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01524.htm.php.html">Table 34.</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Each proficiency slot is empty until the player “fills” it by selecting a
proficiency. If your DM allows nonweapon proficiencies, the character's
Intelligence score can modify the number of slots he has, granting him more proficiencies
(see <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01432.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01432.htm.php.html">Table 4</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">). In both cases, new proficiencies are learned the same way.
<P></P>
Consider the case of Rath, a dwarf fighter. <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01524.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01524.htm.php.html">Table 34</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> gives him four weapon proficiency slots (he is a warrior). If nonweapon
proficiencies are used, he has three slots and his Intelligence of 11 gives him two
additional proficiency slots (according to <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01432.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01432.htm.php.html">Table 4</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">) for a total of five nonweapon proficiency slots. The player must assign
weapon or nonweapon proficiencies to all of these slots before the character goes
on his first adventure. These represent what the character has learned before
beginning his adventuring career.
<P></P>
Thereafter, as the character advances in experience levels, he gains
additional proficiency slots. The rate at which he gains them depends on the group he
belongs to. <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01524.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01524.htm.php.html">Table 34</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> lists how many weapon and nonweapon proficiency slots the character starts
with, and how many levels the character must gain before he earns another slot.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Initial Weapon Proficiencies</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">is the number of weapon proficiency slots received by characters of that group
at 1st level.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B># Levels</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">(for both weapon and nonweapon proficiencies) tells how quickly a character
gains additional proficiency slots. A new proficiency slot is gained at every
experience level that is evenly divisible by the number listed. Rath (a warrior),
for example, gains one weapon proficiency slot at every level evenly divisible
by 3. He gets one new slot at 3rd level, another at 6th, another at 9th, and so
on. (Note that Rath also gains one nonweapon proficiency at 3rd, 6th, 9th,
etc.)

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Penalty</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> is the modifier to the character's attack rolls when he fights using a weapon
he is not proficient with. Rath, a dwarf, chose to be proficient with the
warhammer. Finding himself in a desperate situation, he snatches up a flail, even
though he knows little about it (he is not proficient with it). Using with
weapon awkwardly, he has a -2 penalty to his chance to hit.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Initial Nonweapon Proficiencies</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">is the number of nonweapon proficiency slots that character has at 1st level.
Even if you are playing with weapon proficiencies, nonweapon proficiencies are
optional.
