With this spell, the caster creates a small variation in probabilities. This
variation lasts only a moment, but creates alternate results for one recent
event. When the spell is cast, any one event attempted by the recipient during the
previous round is recalculated, essentially allowing (or forcing) the creature
to make new die rolls.
<P></P>
Only events that begin and end in a single round can be affected. Only one die
roll can be rerolled. If the creature touched is a willing recipient, the
player can choose which roll (the original or the new roll) affects him, more than
likely picking the most successful. If the creature is unwilling, he must redo
the action. The second result, whatever its outcome, cannot be changed.
<P></P>
Typical uses of this spell include allowing a fighter to reroll an attack,
forcing an opponent to reroll a saving throw, or allowing a wizard to reroll the
damage caused by a fireball.
<P></P>
The material component is a small, unmarked die.
