mages are not necessarily evil, most tend to be grim characters who are at home
in the darkness. The school of shadow is built around the thesis that all
shadows are actually connected in some mystical way in the Demiplane of Shadow; the
shadow mage?s repertoire of spells reflects this belief. Shadow mages must be
keen-minded individuals; a character must have an Intelligence of 15 and a
Wisdom of 16 (Intelligence/Reason and Wisdom/Will) in order to select this
specialty. The school of shadow is opposed by the schools of invocation/evocation and
abjuration.

The shadow mage follows the normal rules for specialist wizards, with one
notable exception: the target?s saving throw modifiers are tied to the prevalent
lighting conditions, and range from +2 to ?4. The shadow mage himself receives no
saving throw modifiers versus spells of any kind (see <A HREF="DD03406.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03406.htm">Table 3</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Shadow Mage Target Saving Throw Modifiers).

Shadow mages also gain the ability to see in darkness due to their connection
with the plane of gloom. At 4th level, the shadow mage sees as well in
moonlight as a normal human does by broad daylight, and all darkness-based combat
penalties are reduced by 1 point. At 7th level, he can see perfectly by starlight
and reduces combat penalties for darkness by 2 points. At 10th level, the shadow
mage can see perfectly in total darkness, negating all combat penalties. Note
that magical blindness or fog can still impair the wizard?s vision.

The shadow mage?s spells are both powerful and subtle. Of all the specialist
wizards, he makes the best spy or infiltrator, especially by night. While the
shadow mage isn?t very well-suited for open battle, his spells are perfect for
solitary confrontations.
