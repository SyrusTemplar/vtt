Now, when you take a Called Shot against one of those special locations,
interesting things can happen:
<P></P>
If the attack's damage equalled or exceeded the victim's &quot;Numbed&quot; number in a
single blow, then that location is Numbed. It is useless for the rest of this
combat round. At the start of the next round, before initiative is rolled, the
character recovers full use of that body part.
<P></P>
If the attack's damage equalled or exceeded the victim's &quot;Useless&quot; number in a
single blow, then that location is injured, and is Useless for the rest of the
fight. Once the fight is over (i.e., one side or the other is defeated,
surrendered, or departed, or the two sides are now at peace), the character recovers
use of the injured body part in 2d6 minutesâ€”or immediately upon its being
magically healed up to the &quot;Numbed&quot; number or better.
<P></P>
For these effects to take place, remember that the attack must have done the
required amount of damage in a <I>single blow</I>; multiple blows don't add together for this purpose.
<P></P>
Damage from Punching, Wrestling, and Martial Arts can also cause body parts to
become Numbed and Useless.
<P></P>
A Sap attack (described above under &quot;Melee Maneuvers&quot;), regardless of how much
damage it does, does not achieve the Numbed or Useless results. That maneuver
attempts an instant knockout; if the knockout fails, the victim takes only the
damage done by the attack and none of the special body locations results
described here.
