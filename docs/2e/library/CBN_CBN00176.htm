<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Appearance:</B> For a lich, Vermissa’s body is remarkably well-preserved, still possessing
the same voluptuous curves and alluring contours of an attractive young woman.
Vermissa carries the full weight of her undead transformation in her face, where
the skin has shrunken tight over her skull, and her eyes burn with infernal
radiance in their empty sockets. She sometimes uses a <I>solipsism</I> to disguise her true nature (she can subdue her aura, chilling touch, and
glowing eyes at will). Vermissa’s voice can be soft and sweet (she can sing
beautifully) when she is receiving visitors; when angered, however, her voice gains a
tone of commanding power and malevolence.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Background:</B> Vermissa lived when the first Necromancer King ruled Sahu in the distant
past. She founded the Cult of Worms, directly challenging King Uruk’s authority.
Even then, Vermissa’s power was great, and Uruk dared not anger Thasmudyan, her
infernal patron. Rather than destroying Vermissa, Uruk and eight of his barons
forged an eternal prison for their nemesis. They lured Vermissa into the Garden
of Eternity and locked her within using nine seals of power.
<P></P>
Vermissa raged against Uruk, but he left her there to perish. In time, Uruk
passed away, and his dynasty faded into oblivion, but Vermissa lived on, granted
the gift of lichdom by Thasmudyan. Although she is prevented from physically
leaving the Garden, others can enter and leave at will.
<P></P>
She has since rebuilt her Cult of Worms into a semblance of its former glory.
Vermissa has cultivated relationships with powerful necromancers like Kazerabet
(see her NPC sheet), providing ancient lore in exchange for destroying a seal
of her prison. Now only three seals remain, and she is slowly training her own
branch of wizards through Pizentios (see his NPC sheet). Once her private corps
of necromancers is sufficiently powerful, she will be free at last.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Role-Playing Notes:</B> Vermissa is a master manipulator, a priestess and politician with a long-term
view. Her living cult members control all the villages on Sahu, and her
countless undead minions (ghouls and ghasts mostly) range freely over the island's
“haunted” highlands. Vermissa’s power is strongest on Sahu. She can project her
spirit into any undead creature on the island and see through the eyes of any
corpse within a score of miles from her lair. Her power extends, more tenuously,
from Sahu to the mainland beyond, where her fanatical cult members have
insinuated their way into positions of political power and authority.
<P></P>
Vermissa's quick and agile mind has been numbed by centuries of boredom. She
would gladly welcome a party of explorers into her subterranean Garden to
relieve some of the monotony. She might even let some of them live if they are
suitably entertaining. If not, their remains can be served to Thasmudyan at his next
infernal feast. Hostile visitors will meet a similar fate.
