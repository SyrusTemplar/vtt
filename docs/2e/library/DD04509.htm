<TITLE>Saddle of Flying-- Miscellaneous Magic (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Saddle of Flying:</B> This saddle resembles a normal leather saddle with a small, silver buckle
near the pommel. When the saddle is secured to a horse or any other nonmagical
mount and the silver buckle is fastened, the mount sprouts wings and acquires the
ability to fly at its normal movement rate (Maneuverability Class D). The
flying mount can carry its normal encumbrance.
<P></P>
The <I>saddle of flying</I> functions for only one hour per day. When the silver buckle is unfastened or
the duration expires, the wings disappear and all flying ability is immediately
lost, regardless of whether the mount is airborne or on the ground.
