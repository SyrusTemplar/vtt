<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>Militant Wizard</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Description</B>: The Militant Wizard is skilled in
both magical and military arts, making him an extremely formidable
opponent. They can come from aggressive, warmongering cultures bent
on the conquest of weaker nations, or from cultures continually under
siege from their more warlike neighbors, making military preparedness
vital to their defense. In any case, the Militant Wizard considers a
trained body as important as a trained mind, and prides himself on
keeping his combat skills as sharp as his magical talents.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">A character must have a Strength of at least 13 to be
a Militant Wizard. Though male Militant Wizards will be more common,
female Militant Wizards are allowable as well, unless the DM's world
specifically forbids them.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Abandoning this kit is difficult. A Militant Wizard
must abstain from using both of the weapons he has chosen for his
Weapon Proficiencies for three full experience levels. Once he
reaches the third experience level, he loses the use of his two
Weapon Proficiencies. If he then renounces his citizenship from his
home culture, he can successfully abandon this kit.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">For example, consider a 5th-level Militant Wizard with
Weapon Proficiencies in short sword and long bow. If he abstains from
using both of these weapons (and the corresponding Weapon
Proficiencies), he loses his Weapon Proficiencies in short sword and
long bow when he reaches 8th level. If he then renounces his
citizenship from his home culture, he can abandon this kit. If he
uses these weapons before reaching 8th level, he must begin again,
abstaining for an additional three levels of experience (for
instance, if he uses his long bow Weapon Proficiency when at 7th
level, he'll have to abstain until he reaches 10th level in order to
abandon this kit. )</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Preferred Schools:</B> Militant Wizards prefer
schools with an excess of offensive and defensive spells, such as
abjuration, alteration, conjuration/summoning, invocation/evocation,
and necromancy.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Barred Schools:</B> Militant Wizards are barred
from specializing in the schools of enchantment/charm and illusion,
as their cultures tend to consider them relatively useless in combat.
Though greater divination has uses on the battlefield, particularly
in the area of reconnaissance, Militant Wizards are discouraged, but
not barred, from divination specialization.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Role:</B> Militant Wizards are among the most
honored and respected citizens in their societies, since their
powerful magic makes them exceptionally able soldiers. Depending on
his background, the Militant Wizard may be a brutal, savage killer,
wallowing in the violence of the battlefield, or he may be a heroic
warrior, fighting with honor and taking lives only when necessary.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">A Militant Wizard might have a variety of reasons for
joining an adventuring party. Perhaps he shares the party's goal of
defeating a force of evil, or he might be seeking treasure to finance
his own army at home. He might wish to study the fighting techniques
of other cultures, or he might hire on as a mercenary.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Whatever his reasons, the Militant Wizard's fighting
skills should greatly benefit any party. He makes an excellent
leader, but he is also capable of following orders to the letter,
assuming the orders are issued by a commander he respects. The
Militant Wizard tends to prefer action to inaction and combat to
negotiation. He is skeptical of scholarly and philosophic types, and
is unlikely to form close relationships with such characters.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Secondary Skills:</B> No particular Secondary Skill
is recommended or required. He receives his Secondary Skill either by
choosing or rolling randomly, whatever method is normal for the campaign.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Weapon Proficiency:</B> Required (choose one from
of the following): Battle axe, bow (any), crossbow (any), dagger,
javelin, sling, spear, sword (any), warhammer. These are different
from the weapons normally associated with wizards, but they are
common for Militant Wizards. Also, see the Special Benefits section below.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Nonweapon Proficiency:</B> Bonus: (Warrior)
Endurance. Recommended: (General) Animal Handling, Direction Sense,
Riding (Land-based), Swimming;(Wizard) Languages (Ancient); (Warrior;
these take 2 slots only) Blind- fighting, Tracking, (Warrior; these
take 1 slot only) Mountaineering, Running, Set Snares.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Equipment:</B> The Militant Wizard may buy any
equipment he chooses, keeping whatever money he might not use.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Special Benefits:</B> The Militant Wizard receives
a bonus Weapon Proficiency free of charge; this is in addition to his
normal Weapon Proficiency. This bonus Weapon Proficiency does not use
any of the wizard's proficiency slots, but he must choose it from the
weapons listed in the Weapon Proficiency entry above. Additionally, a
Militant Wizard can acquire any of the Warrior's Nonweapon
Proficiencies given on </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="PHB_DD01538.htm">Table
37</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> on page 55 of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>
at the listed number of slots; for instance, if a Militant Wizard
wants the Animal Lore proficiency, it costs him only 1 slot instead
of the normal 2 for a wizard.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Special Hindrances:</B> Because a Militant Wizard
devotes so much of his time and energy to the mastery of military
skills, he is limited in his access to spells from various schools.
Table 6 lists the oppositional schools for Militant Wizards of each
specialty; the Militant Wizard is forbidden to learn spells from
these schools.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3">Militant Wizard mages are likewise limited. The DM may
decide which of the following limitations affects Militant Wizard
mages in his campaign (choose only one limitation).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">1. The Militant Wizard mage is forbidden to learn
8th-level and 9th-level spells from any school.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">2. The Militant Wizard mage learns spells as if his
Intelligence were two points lower than he actually has, as indicated
on </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="PHB_DD01432.htm">Table
4</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, page 16 of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>.
This limitation also affects the number of languages he can learn,
the highest level of spells he can cast, the maximum number of spells
per level he can know, and his spell immunity. For instance, if this
limitation is in effect for a Militant Wizard mage with an
Intelligence score of 15, he can only know three languages, can cast
spells of no higher than 6th-level, has a 55 percent chance to learn
a new spell, and has a maximum of nine spells per level that he can know.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">3. The Militant Wizard mage can learn spells from only
five schools. To determine which schools are unavailable to him, roll
1d8 three times, where 1 = abjuration, 2 = conjuration/summoning, 3 =
greater divination, 4 = enchantment/charm, 5 = illusion, 6 =
invocation/evocation, 7 = necromancy, and 8 = alteration. If the same
result occurs twice, roll again.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Wealth Options:</B> The Militant Wizard receives
the standard (1d4 + 1) x 10 starting money.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Races:</B> No restrictions</FONT></P>
