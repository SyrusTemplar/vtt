<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Any square that a creature can reach with its weapons
or claws also <I>threatens </I>those squares and therefore any
characters or creatures standing in one of the threatened squares.
The character&#146;s own facing doesn&#146;t matter&#151;it&#146;s
possible to be threatened by someone standing behind you.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Threatened characters can choose to ignore the
creature threatening them and take any combat action they wish, but
if they do, the threatening creature gains an immediate attack of
opportunity. The following actions create an attack of opportunity
for the threatening creature:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Attempting missile
combat (other than at the threatening creature, and only in the
combat round when it first threatens the character).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Moving away from the
threatening creature. This includes move, charge, and run, but not withdraw.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Turning so that the
threatening creature is now in a rear square.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Attempting an
unarmed attack against any foe except an unarmed human-like creature.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Monsters and characters threaten all eligible squares
throughout the entire round. If a character tries to sprint through
the threatened squares to get by the defender, the defender gets an
attack of opportunity as the character runs by. If the creature being
attacked suffers from a successful knockdown roll or if a critical
hit from the attack of opportunity is suffered, then it must stop
moving. Otherwise, it may run by the creature threatening it.</FONT></P>
