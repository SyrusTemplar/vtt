A priest casting <I>fear contagion</I> selects a single creature to be the focus of the spell. The creature is
affected by magical fear and receives no saving throw to avoid the effect. All
creatures within 10 yards of the target creature must make a saving throw versus
spell with a -4 penalty; failure indicates that they are also affected by fear.
<P></P>
If BATTLESYSTEM™ rules are used, the spell forces the affected unit to make a
Morale Check at a -6 penalty. If this roll fails, the unit automatically routs.
<P></P>
Creatures affected by fear will flee in a direction away from the spellcaster
for as long as they are able to run (refer to Chapter 14 of the <A HREF="PHB_DD01776.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01776.htm">Player's Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> for rules). Such creatures will then spend one full turn cowering after being
forced to rest. During this time, affected creatures suffer -4 penalties to
attack rolls, and all dexterity bonuses are negated.
<P></P>
When using BATTLESYSTEM rules, fear-struck creatures are permitted rally tests
with a -3 penalty and must engage in rout movement until they rally. However,
a rally test is not permitted until two turns of rout movement have been
completed.
<P></P>
As creatures run in fear, their fear is contagious. Any creature that comes
within 10 yards of a creature affected by this spell must make a saving throw (no
penalties) or be forced to flee from the spellcaster. In BATTLESYSTEM™ rules,
creatures make a standard Morale Check with a -3 penalty.
<P></P>
Creatures affected by fear no longer cause fear in others after they have
passed one mile from the original center of the spell effect.
