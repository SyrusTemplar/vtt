Do other minor schools of magic exist? That's a decision for the DM. Depending
on the DM's style and the parameters of his campaign, he could select a small
group of spells and assign them to a minor school. For instance, a minor school
of lesser illusions could include all illusions of 1st-level through
3rd-level. A minor school of lesser abjuration/necromancy could include all abjuration
and necromancy spells of 1st level.
<P></P>
To add color to the campaign rule, the DM might want to create a historical
explanation for the existence of any new minor schools. It's possible, for
instance, that the minor school of lesser illusions was created by the administration
of an academy of magic to accommodate students who lacked the aptitude to
become full-fledged illusionists. The minor school of abjuration/necromancy might
have been developed by an ancient clan of good-aligned wizards to help protect
them from attacks by a rival band of abjurers allied with a force of undead.
<P></P>
All wizards, regardless of their specialty, should have access to the spells
of any minor school. If he wishes, the DM may assign bonuses and penalties to
the various specialists' chances of learning the spells of a related minor
school. Some possibilities follow.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> A specialist has a 15 percent (or 30 percent) bonus, a non-specialist has a 15
percent (or 30 percent) penalty.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> A specialist has a 30 percent bonus, a non-specialist has a 30 percent
penalty.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Both the specialist and the non-specialist have 15 percent (or 30 percent)
bonuses.
<P></P>

Careful judgement should always be exercised when adding new minor schools.
Remember that the more access characters have to magic, the more powerful they
become. And the more powerful the characters are, the harder it is for the DM to
maintain play balance. In general, the following two guidelines should apply:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> A minor school should include only a handful of low-level spells, none of them
higher than 4th-level. Four or five 1st-level spells, two or three 2nd-level
spells, one or two 3rd-level spells, and one or two 4th-level spells are
sufficient.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> A campaign should include no more than two minor schools. (Note than in almost
every campaign, one of the two minor schools will be lesser divination.)
