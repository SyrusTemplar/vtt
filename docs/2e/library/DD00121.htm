Developed from the common agricultural sickle or scythe, the fauchard consists
of a long, curving blade with a large, pointed head and a <I>fluke</I> (a small, curved hook found on many polearms). The head is mounted on a
wooden pole about eight feet long. Peasants can often change scythes into fauchards.

The fauchard is classified as a glaive. It is not very good as a thrusting
weapon, but is used mainly as a slashing weapon. It fulfils the need for a weapon
that puts some distance between the wielder and his enemy.

Since the fauchard is not an instrument designed foremost as a weapon but
rather a farm tool adapted for war, it is inefficient as a weapon of war, being
rather bulky and needing a large area to be used properly.
