The first place to start is the creation of the universe and the world.
<P></P>
In most creation stories, there was usually some disinteresting, stable
condition in effect at the dawn of time. It might have been a formless void, or
darkness, or unending ice and snow.
<P></P>
Then, we have the first great being, the one who brings about creation of the
world. Note that this great being doesn't have to be the god who is now
dominant in the campaign world. The myths are packed with tales of gods who created
their worlds, became oppressive, and were then cast down by other gods, even
their own children, who now rule in their place.
<P></P>
Nor does the creation have to have been a deliberate event. It might have been
an accident; the god could have been dreaming and his dreams became reality.
<P></P>
The creator could be a tremendous monster, one which began the process of
creating the world, but was overthrown before it finished making the world to its
own satisfaction . . . and one which, legends say, will return some day to
finish the job.
<P></P>
It could be a simple creature, one not necessarily deserving of worship, which
shapes the world simply by acting as the animal it is. As one example, if the
original state of the universe were a giant block of salt, this creature could
be a giant cow which licks it into the shape of the world.
<P></P>
In some mythologies, the great being that shapes the world stays around after
that task is done; he or she might be the principal deity of the world. More
often, that great being perishes, or is cast down by descendants, or settles for
a lesser role once creation is accomplished.

<P></P>
What is the shape of the world and the universe once they are created? What
are suns, moons, planets and stars?
<P></P>
The entire universe could be a single huge world, with a dome overhead which
holds the stars and confines the sun(s) and moon(s). The world could be a disk,
a sphere, a bowl, or an unending surface continuing in all directions to
infinity.
<P></P>
The sun and moon could be glowing chariots, or bright gods continually flying
across the sky (perhaps as a service to the world, perhaps because they're
being chased). They could be worlds unto themselves, and the player-characters
might someday have the opportunity to visit and walk the bright surface of the sun
in search of adventure. They could be the great, glowing eyes of the most
powerful deity. They could be gigantic, fiercely-burning lamps created by the
craftsman-god, lamps which circle the world on some giant mechanism. (Perhaps,
instead of circling the world, they just shut off each day when the time is due; the
sun just turns off, and the moons just turn on.) They could even be suns and
moons as we understand them, though some of the charm of fantasy lies precisely
in making such things <I>different </I>from our cold, modern explanations of them.
<P></P>
The planets and stars could be holes in the dome of the sky, suggesting that
there is a great brightness beyond. They could be decorations placed in the sky
by the gods. They could be worlds unto themselves. They could be glowing
creatures forced to trace paths through the sky every night. They could be the suns
of distant worlds.
<P></P>
And, of course, the DM can choose for all these astronomic bodies to be one
thing, but for the prevailing belief of the people to be different, an incorrect
belief; nothing says that the world's deities want the humans and demihumans to
know the truth.

<P></P>
<P></P>
In the real world, the terrain of the human culture to which a mythology
belonged often had a strong effect on the myths. Norse mythology started with a
huge abyss filled with ice, for instance.
<P></P>
If one race's religion is dominant in the campaign world, the DM should
decide whether or not their creation-story has a setting like the land where that
race originated.
<P></P>
In a fantasy world, this situation could come about from one of two reasons:
<P></P>
The gods, having emerged from a particular type of terrain, would find similar
terrain in the mortal world to be their favorite land for creating new races,
exploring, and interacting with humans; or
<P></P>
The sentient races might have erroneously re-interpreted the story of the
world's creation as a reflection of the terrain in which they live, and the legend
is simply wrong.
