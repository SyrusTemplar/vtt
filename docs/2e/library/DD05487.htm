Some priesthoods, the most powerful ones in a culture, are able to demand <I>tithes</I> of their followers. A tithe is an amount of money, often represented as a
fraction of the money-earner's regular wage, which the follower is required to pay
to the priesthood. Theoretically, it is used for upkeep of churches and
temples, purchase of supplies and equipment for the priests, etc. Some priesthoods
also use these moneys for influence with the government; a very few corrupt
priests dip into it for personal gain.
<P></P>
In an AD&amp;D? game campaign, only the religion of a monotheistic state, or the
state religion, will be able legally to demand tithes of its followers. Such
tithes will usually run from 5% to 15% of the character's income, with 10% being
most common.
<P></P>
Priesthoods of other faiths will ask their followers to tithe a like amount.
Naturally, not all their followers will tithe and so such religions bring in
less tithed income than those who can demand it.
<P></P>
Player-character priests don't get to see that money; it is recorded by church
accountants, stored in church treasures, and distributed or spent by superior
priests.
