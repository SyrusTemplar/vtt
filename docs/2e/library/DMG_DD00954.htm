<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Girdle of Dwarvenkind:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This belt lowers the wearers' Charisma score by 1 with respect to nondwarves
and their ilk. The girdle causes the wearer to gain one point of Charisma with
respect to halflings of the stout sort and with respect to all gnomes as well.
Dwarves regard the wearer as if he has Charisma two points higher than before.
The girdle enables the wearer to understand, speak, and read dwarvish language.
The wearer also gains the racial benefits of dwarvenkind (i.e., +1
Constitution, saving throw bonuses based on total Constitution, 60-foot infravision, and
detection/determination of approximate depth underground as described in the <A HREF="PHB_DD01445.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01445.htm">Player's Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> ). All bonuses and penalties apply only as long as the individual actually
wears the girdle. Benefits such as additional languages and combat bonuses
against giant-type-opponents never apply.
