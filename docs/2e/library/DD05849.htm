This is most likely to be an organized activity in a port, or possibly in a
major inland trade city built on a nexus of trade roads. In the case of a port,
there is a possibility that thieves might also be allied with pirates, both
through smuggling and through getting messages to the pirates regarding the sailing
times, cargoes, and protection of sailing vessels leaving the port. The
smuggling can be of any prohibited item or items, and in troubled lands the smuggling
of weapons can be particularly lucrative.

Subtle variants on this theme are possible. Consider a thieves' guild which
has good connections with the rulers, in a weak country ruled by evil. The
country might officially outlaw slavery (for fear of offending neighboring countries
which are not ruled by evil), while the thieves actually carry this on as a
subterfuge activity, smuggling slaves into and perhaps through the country. This
is done with the full knowledge and connivance of the rulers, who take a
percentage of the profits. Selling the slaves to another, more distant, evil land
could raise plenty of funds for the thieves and the rulers. In time, this evil land
could flourish and become strong on the profits of its wicked trade.
