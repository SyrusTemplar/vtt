sacrificing any spellcasting ability. All other requirements for receiving a quest
spell must be met normally, see the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dTM_DD04140.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dTM_DD04140.htm.php.html">Tome of Magic</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I> </I>for details.

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Improved Undead Turning: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Upon reaching 21st level, a priest who receives the granted power to turn
undead can use the power multiple times within the same encounter. The character
may continue to turn undead so long as prior attempts against the same group of
creatures were successful. Once an attempt fails, the priest cannot continue.
<P></P>
In the case of mixed groups of undead, where a single turning attempt succeeds
against some creatures in the group but not others, further attempts to turn
the unaffected creatures are useless. Weaker creatures continue to be affected
as long as attempts against them succeed.
<P></P>
For example, Wulf meets a lich, six vampires, and a horde of skeletons and
ghouls. Wulf is a 21st-level cleric and rolls a 7 on his turning attempt. Wulf
automatically destroys 2d6+2d4 skeletons and 2d6+2d4 ghouls. The roll is
sufficient to turn the vampires; Wulf rolls 2d6 and gets a 5, leaving one vampire
unaffected. The turning roll of 7 is insufficient to turn the lich. The next round,
Wulf can use his turning ability against the skeletons, ghouls, and the
remaining vampire, but the lich is unaffected since Wulf’s initial roll did not affect
him.

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Increased Spell Selection: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">At 21st level, the priest gains minor access to a sphere of spells the
character previously did not have access to or gains access to another level of spells
in a sphere the character already has minor access to.
<P></P>
For example, clerics do not have access to the plant, animal, or weather
spheres, and they have only minor access to the elemental sphere. A 21st-level
cleric could gain minor access to the plant, animal, or weather sphere or get access
to 4th-level elemental spells. The DM can make the selection or let the player
choose.
<P></P>
At 25th level, the priest gains minor access to another sphere of spells or
adds access to another level of spells in one of the character’s minor spheres,
including the minor sphere the priest added or enhanced at 21st level.
<P></P>
At 27th level, the priest gains minor access to another sphere of spells or
adds access to another level of spells in one of the character’s minor spheres,
including the minor spheres added or enhanced previously.

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Holy Army: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A priest of 21st level or higher can call up an army of dedicated followers to
accomplish a single task. The task can be as simple or complex as the priest
desires, but it must be something that can be accomplished through force of
arms. Acceptable tasks include: destroying a particular castle, temple, or town;
rescuing a captive; recovering a stolen item; bringing a fugitive to justice;
deposing a ruler; and so on. The task cannot violate the principles of the
priest’s alignment or ethos. A priest cannot summon a holy army if the character
already has one in the field and cannot summon more than one each year.
<P></P>
A holy army can contain as many troops as the priest’s experience point total
divided by 1,000. For example, a priest who has just attained 21st level can
summon 2,925 troops. Most troops are 0-level fighters, but there is one commander
of half the priest’s level (round down). The commander in turn has two
assistants of half the commander’s level, and each of those characters have two more
assistants and so on. Each commander and assistant also has a priest or cleric
of similar level. For example, a holy army summoned by a 21st-level priest has
one commander of 10th level, two subcommanders of 5th level, four lieutenants of
2nd level, and eight sergeants of 1st level. Each officer is accompanied by a
priest of similar level. If the priest is lawful good, there is a 10% chance
that any given officer is a paladin. If the priest is of any good alignment, and
the task involves activities in the wilderness, there is a 10% that any
commander is a ranger.
<P></P>
To summon a holy army, the priest must be in a place where people worship the
character’s deity openly. A holy army takes two weeks to gather for every 500
people in it, though the priest can summon a smaller army. If worshippers of the
character’s deity are not common in the area where the priest is, the
gathering time is doubled. An army usually stays together for a maximum of one month
for each level of the priest summoning it. However, the priest can hold it
together a little longer by paying the troops well (2–4 gp per 0-level trooper and
100 gp per level for commanders and priests) or by making a successful
Charisma/Leadership check. In either case, the army’s goal must be within easy reach, and
the troops remain active for an additional 2d4 months.
<P></P>
When an army disbands, the troops may return home or they may decide to remain
together as an independent force to pursue their own goals. It is best if the
priest sees to it that the troops return home instead of giving a more radical
element the opportunity to take control of the army.
