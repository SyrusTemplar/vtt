The couatl are feathered serpents of myth and lore. It is believed that they
are distant relatives of dragons, although this remains unproven.
<P></P>
So rare as to be considered almost legendary, the couatl is one of the most
beautiful creatures in existence. It has the body of a long serpent and feathered
wings the color of the rainbow. Since it has the ability to polymorph, the
couatl will sometimes appear in the form of other creatures (always of good
alignment).
<P></P>
Couatl are able to communicate via telepathy with almost any intelligent
creature which they encounter. In addition, they can speak common and most serpent
and avian languages.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A couatl will seldom attack without provocation, though it will always attack
evildoers caught red-handed. Whenever possible, a couatl will attack from the
air.
<P></P>
Since it is highly intelligent, the couatl will frequently use its spells from
a distance before closing with its foes. If more than one couatl is involved,
they will discuss their strategy before a battle. The couatl will also not
hesitate to polymorph into another, more effective form in combat.
<P></P>
The couatl have a variety of abilities which make them more than a match for
most other creatures. In addition to being able to polymorph themselves at will,
a couatl can use magic. Fully 45% will be 5th level wizards, while 35% can act
as 7th level priests. The remaining 20% are able to use both types of
abilities.
<P></P>
In addition to their other magical abilities, couatl can render themselves and
up to 450 pounds of additional matter ethereal at will. Further, they can <I>detect good/evil, detect magic,</I> turn <I>invisible</I>, and employ <I>ESP</I> whenever they desire to do so. The oldest and most powerful of couatl can
also use a <I>plane shift</I> on themselves and up to 8 others. This ability has a 90% chance of reaching
the desired plane.
<P></P>
The couatl uses its poisonous bite and constriction when forced into melee
combat. When it bites it does 1-3 points of damage and injects a deadly toxin. If
the victim fails a save vs. poison it is killed instantly. If the constriction
attack succeeds, the victim takes 2-8 points damage each round until it or the
couatl is killed.
<P></P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This winged serpent is native to warm, jungle-like regions but can also be
found flying through the ether. Their intelligence and goodness have made them
objects of reverence by the natives of the regions which they inhabit. Considered
to be divine, there are many legends in which the couatl is the benefactor of
mankind and the bestower of such precious gifts as agriculture and medicine.
There are even shrines in certain areas dedicated to the couatl, and any who
attack or harm a couatl are automatically viewed as the blackest of villains.
<P></P>
Although solitary in nature, couatl think of themselves as a single, extended
clan. This clan is led by the oldest and wisest of their numbers but assembles
only in dire emergencies.
<P></P>
Most couatl dwell alone, making their lairs in caves and abandoned buildings
in remote, uninhabited regions. They hunt jungle animals for food once every
fortnight or so. Many enjoy traveling, often undertaking long journeys of
exploration.
<P></P>
On rare occasions, a pair will mate for life and establish a joint lair.
Unlike many other reptiles, the couatl bear live young. Births are rare, averaging
only one per couple each century. Both parents participate in the rearing and
education of the single offspring, and will fight to the death if their child is
threatened. Young couatl reach maturity in thirty or forty years and, though
some will elect to remain with their parents for as long as a century, will
eventually set off in search of the couatl's never-ending quest for wisdom.
<P></P>
Intellectually curious, all couatl have vast stores of information and enjoy
learning more. When one of them learns some new and fascinating fact he will
inevitably set out in search of his brethren to share and discuss it.
<P></P>
Couatl can sometimes be persuaded to help good adventurers or give sound
council. If they feel that they are being sought for frivolous reasons, they will
simply fly away. They are not greedy and do not seek treasure for its own sake.
Aid from a couatl may well take the form of a magical item from its hoard.
<P></P>

most other monsters.
