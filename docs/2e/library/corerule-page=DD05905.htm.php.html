These include racial divisions, religious persecution of thieves, unique
historical factors, and the like. The DM should note any of these which are
important. Since such factors will always be unique, there is no way the design system
here can accommodate them. The DM will have to ascribe modifiers to certain
dice rolls for these factors as he sees fit!
