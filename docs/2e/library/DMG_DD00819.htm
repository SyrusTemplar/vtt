<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Rod of Alertness:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This magical rod is indistinguishable from a <I>footman's mace +1.</I> It has eight flanges on its macelike head. The rod bestows +1 to the
possessor's die roll for being surprised, and in combat the possessor gains -1 on
initiative die rolls. If it is grasped firmly, the rod enables the character to <I>detect alignment, evil, good,</I> illusions, <I>invisibility, lie,</I> or <I>magic.</I> The use of these detect powers does not expend any of the charges in the rod.
<P></P>
If the <I>rod of alertness</I> is planted in the ground, and the possessor wills it to alertness, the rod
will &quot;sense'' any creature intends to harm the possessor. Each of the flanges on
the rod's head then cast a <I>light</I> spell along one of the main directions (N, NE, E, etc.) out to a 60-foot
range. At the same time, the rod creates the effect of a <I>prayer</I> spell upon all creatures friendly to the possessor in a 20-foot radius.
Immediately thereafter, the rod sends forth a mental alert to these friendly
creature, warning them of possible danger from the unfriendly creature(s) within the
120-foot radius.
<P></P>
Lastly, the rod can be used to simulate the casting of an <I>animate object</I> spell, utilizing any 16 (or fewer) objects specially designated by the
possessor and placed roughly around the perimeter of a 6-foot-radius circle centered
on the rod. The selected objects can be 16 shrubs, 16 specially shaped
branches, or whatever.
<P></P>
All of the rod's protective functions require one charge. The <I>animate object</I> power require one additional charge, so, if all of the rod's protective
devices are utilized at once, two charges are expended.
<P></P>
The rod can be recharged by a priest of 16th level or higher, as long as at
least one charge remains in the rod when the recharging is attempted.
