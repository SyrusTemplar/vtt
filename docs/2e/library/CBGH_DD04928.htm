The Urchin is a specialized halfling thief who attempts to pass as a human
child. Many an unsuspecting victim has tried to collar the annoying brat, only to
learn that the apparently feeble child who robbed him or her is in fact an
adult with all the skills of an accomplished thief.
<P></P>
Urchins are encountered almost exclusively in cities and large towns, where
people don't know all their neighbors. Roaming the chaotic network of a city's
streets and alleys, the Urchin blends in to the local population, keeping several
escape routes and hiding holes ready to hand at all times. Living mostly on
the street, the Urchin takes shelter where he or she can find it--as often as not
among the poor and destitute of the community.
<P></P>
The Urchin must have a Charisma score of at least 11.
<P></P>
Roads to Adventure: The Urchin character is typically a kit chosen by
necessity--a halfling comes to a city alone and finds no market for his or her skills.
At the same time, he or she grows tired of sneering bullies, some of whom pick
on the halfling merely because of his or her size. Finding it easier to escape
unwanted attention by blending in than by flight, he or she finds welcome
anonymity in a life of disguise.
<P></P>
Role: The Urchin typically works alone, though he or she may well be a member
of a small group; urban thieves' guilds made up entirely of halflings have been
known to exist, most of whose members will be either Urchins or Burglars.
Sometimes a halfling Urchin becomes the leader of a gang of children, both human
and demihuman. In this case the Urchin will take a very protective, almost
parental care with his or her young charges.
<P></P>
Dressing in juvenile clothes, with a haircut similar to those of local
children, the Urchin will wander about the city like any child with a free day.
However, he or she is adept at picking pockets and always has several escape routes
memorized, ready at any moment for a quick getaway.
<P></P>
Diversions and distractions are a part of the Urchin's typical routine. If he
or she can topple--or better yet, get someone else to topple--a fruit vendor's
cart, for example, the resulting confusion will result in a situation ripe with
possibilities for profit.
<P></P>
Secondary Skills: Any or none.
<P></P>
Weapon Proficiencies: The Urchin's double life prevents the character from
openly wearing weapons children would normally not carry (&quot;Say--what's that kid
over there doing with that crossbow?&quot;). Hence Urchins tend toward
easily-concealed or disguised weapons (dagger, darts, sling, quarterstaff).
<P></P>
Bonus Nonweapon Proficiencies: Because his or her very existence depends upon
playing a role, the Urchin quickly develops a knack for disguise. At first
level, the Urchin can effectively disguise himself or herself as a human. Upon
reaching second level, the Urchin gains the Disguise proficiency in full.
<P></P>
Recommended Nonweapon Proficiencies: Forgery, Blindfighting, Tumbling, and
Ventriloquism can all have their uses to the Urchin.
<P></P>
Thieving Skill Emphasis: Urchins are consummate pickpockets (see Special
Benefits, below); Climb Walls and Hide in Shadows are helpful when it comes to
getaways.
<P></P>
Equipment: Aside from weapons and perhaps a set of lockpicks, the Urchin needs
no special equipment.
<P></P>
Special Benefits: With Urchins, picking pockets is both a hobby and a way of
life. Because of constant practice, Urchins develop unusual skill in this
particular aspect of thievery. This translates into a +5% bonus <B>per level</B> to their Pick Pockets rolls, starting at second level (i.e., +5% at 2nd
level, +10% at 3rd level, c.).
<P></P>
Special Hindrances: The local guardsmen and city officials can take a real
dislike to the activities of an Urchin, causing no end of trouble for the poor
player character.
