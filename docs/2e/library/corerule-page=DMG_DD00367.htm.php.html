Everyone gathered around an AD&amp;D game table is playing a game. Games are
entertainment, and entertainment is supposed to be fun. If the players don't have a
good time playing in AD&amp;D game sessions, it shows.
<P></P>
Therefore, one of the goals of the AD&amp;D game is to have fun. Much of the
pressure to provide this elusive quality rests on the DM's shoulders, but the
players can also contribute. When they do, players should be rewarded with experience
points since they are making the game a good experience for all. The DM who
doles out awards for adding to the fun will find more players making the effort
to contribute.
<P></P>
To give out experience points for fun the DM should consider the following:
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>1. Did the player actively get involved in the game? </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A player who does nothing but tell one funny joke during the course of the
game isn't really participating. The DM should be careful, however, not to
penalize players who are naturally shy. Involvement should be measured against a
player's personality.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>2. Did the player make the game fun for others or make fun at their expense? </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The second is not really deserving of any reward.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>3. Was the player disrupting or interfering with the flow of the game? </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This is seldom enjoyable and tends to get on everyone's nerves quickly.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>4. Was the player argumentative or a &quot;rules lawyer?&quot; </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">These are players who can quote every rule in the game and try to use even the
most obscure rules to their advantage, often to the detriment of the spirit of
the game. This is definitely not fun for the DM, but the DM should allow a
reasonable amount of disagreement with his decisions. Players will want (and
should be allowed) to argue their views from time to time. However, rules arguments
properly belong outside the actual game session. The DM should make a ruling
for the moment and then hear appeals to his decision after the adventure. This
way the game is not interrupted.
