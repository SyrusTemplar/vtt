<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Armor of Rage:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This armor is identical in appearance to <I>armor of command</I> and functions as a suit of <I>plate mail +1</I>. However, when worn, the armor causes the character to suffer a -3 penalty to
all encounter checks. All friendly troops within 360 feet have their morale
lowered by -2. The effect is not noticeable to the wearer or those affected
(i.e., characters will not immediately notice that donning the armor is the cause of
their problems).
