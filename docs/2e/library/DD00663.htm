Using the sphere analogy, outside of the Primes and the Ethereal planes are
the <I>inner planes,</I> the primary building forces of the multiverse. The inner planes consist of
the elemental, para-elemental, and quasi-elemental planes, and the planes of
energy. The elemental planes are the building blocks of matter-Air, Water, Fire,
and Earth. Where the elemental planes touch each other there arise the
para-elemental planes-Smoke, Ice, Ooze, and Magma. The Energy planes are the Positive
Energy plane (also called the Plane of Life) and the Negative Energy plane (the
source of entropy). The quasi-elemental planes exist where the elemental planes
touch the Energy planes-Lightning, Steam, Minerals, and Radiance around the
Positive Energy plane, and Salt, Vacuum, Ash, and Dust around the Negative Energy
plane. Many of the planes have their own creatures and rulers who are sometimes
summoned to one of the primes through spells or magical items.
