</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Multi-classed characters are demihumans with two or more
professions-fighter/thief, cleric/wizard, thief/wizard/fighter, etc. Such a character gets to spend
the full allotment of CPs granted by each class. The points from each class
must be spent buying abilities from that class’s list only. The character
receives, however, only one class’s allowance of CPs for purchasing proficiencies; he
gets the largest number allowed by his various classes. He can choose
proficiencies from any of those allowed to any of his classes. When character points are
awarded for advancing a level, they must be divided by the number of classes
the character has (retain fractions, don‘t round them up or down).

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Dual-classed characters are humans who change their current classes and adopt
new professions. For example, a 5th level fighter might put away his sword and
become a 1st level wizard. When he—and any other character—changes professions,
any unspent character points are lost. The 1st level wizard spends his new
character point allotment normally, as if he were adventuring from scratch. When
the wizard’s new level exceeds that of his first class, he can freely use the
abilities of both classes—following all the normal game rules for such a
character.
