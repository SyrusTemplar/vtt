<P></P>
The following spells are altered as described when cast underwater. All spells
are from the <I>Player's Handbook</I>, except those labeled NS (for New Spell) which are found in Chapter 8 of this
book
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>1st Level</B>
<P></P>
<I>Chromatic Orb</I> (NS): The heat, fire, and stinking cloud effects are unavailable underwater.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>2nd Level</B>
<P></P>
<I>Filter </I>(NS): Instead of filtering vapors, filter eliminates poisons in the water.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Ice Knife</I> (NS): Because of water resistance, an ice knife cast underwater can strike
targets only within 10 yards. It causes a maximum of 1-4 hit points of damage.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Melf's Acid Arrow</I>: The acid from this arrow lasts only a single round before it is washed away
by surrounding water.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>3rd Level</B>
<P></P>
<I>Fly</I>: This spell enables the subject to swim effortlessly at any depth and in any
direction, even if the subject is encumbered or is normally too heavy to float.
The maximum speed is 9.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Lightning Bolt:</I> Instead of a stroke, the electrical discharge takes the form of a sphere with
a 20-yard radius, centering on the point where a stroke would have occurred if
the spell had been cast above water. All those within the sphere suffer 1d6
hit points of damage per level of the caster; the maximum damage is 10-60 (10d6)
hit points. A successful saving throw reduces this damage to half (round
fractions down).
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Monster Summoning I:</I> Only creatures that can breathe and function underwater can be summoned. (If
available, the DM should use the appropriate Aquatic Monster Summoning table in
the <I>Monstrous Compendium</I>.)
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Phantom Steed:</I> A phantom steed created underwater is a hippocampi with a black forebody and
silver-gray scales. These steeds do not gain the special traveling or flying
abilities of the regular <I>phantom steeds</I>, but they do gain the movement rate of 4 per level of the spell caster (to a
maximum movement rate of 48). Otherwise, they are similar to the steed created
by the spell.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>4th Level</B>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Ice Storm</I>: The hail stones created by this spell will be as large as normal, but their
downward force is greatly reduced, inflicting only 1-10 hit points of damage
before floating toward the surface. The sleet variation of this spell is useless
underwater, since all of the sleet melts as soon as it is created.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Monster Summoning II:</I> Only creatures that can breathe and function underwater can be summoned. (If
available, the DM should use the appropriate Aquatic Monster Summoning table in
the <I>Monstrous Compendium</I>.)
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Wall of Ice</I>: A <I>wall of ice</I> can be formed underwater, but it immediately floats to the surface and bobs
in the water like an ice floe. This renders the<I> ice plane</I> and hemisphere variations useless. The <I>ice sheet</I> variation of this spell inflicts no damage underwater.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>5th Level</B>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Conjure Elemental: </I>Air elementals and fire elementals cannot be conjured underwater. Earth
elementals must remain on the floor of the sea, lake, or river from which they are
conjured. While unable to leave the floor, they can still attack creatures or
assault constructions that are resting on or are imbedded in the floor. Water
elementals can be conjured normally.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Monster Summoning III</I>: Only creatures that can breathe and function underwater can be summoned. (If
available, the DM should use the appropriate Aquatic Monster Summoning table
in the <I>Monstrous Compendium</I>.)
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Transmute Rock to Mud: </I>This spell operates underwater as it does elsewhere, except that the mud
immediately begins to dissipate. If cast on the ocean floor (or the floor of any
other body of water), only extremely heavy creatures who are unable to swim are in
any danger of sinking into the mud.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>6th Level</B>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Chain Lightning</I>: Underwater, this acts as a <I>lightning bolt</I> of twice the normal size (either a forked bolt up to 20 feet wide and 80 feet
long, or a single bolt 10 feet wide and 160 feet long. However, it strikes
only a single object and inflicts only 1d6 hp of damage for every level of the
caster (save vs. spells for half damage). It will not arc to other targets.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Conjure Animals:</I> Only creatures that can breathe and function underwater can be conjured.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Monster Summoning IV:</I> Only creatures that can breathe and function underwater can be summoned. (If
available, the DM should use the appropriate Aquatic Monster Summoning table in
the <I>Monstrous Compendium</I>.)
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Otluke's Freezing Sphere:</I> The <I>frigid globe</I> variation of this spell can be extremely dangerous to the caster when cast
underwater. The globe of absolute zero matter will instantly freeze the water
around the caster into a block of ice of a volume equal to 50 cubic feet per level
of the caster. The entombed wizard will immediately float to the surface.
Unless he receives assistance or is able to free himself, he will immediately begin
to suffocate.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Part Water:</I> This spell can be used to form a &quot;tunnel&quot; through water-filled areas, no
wider than 10 feet in diameter. The &quot;tunnel&quot; contains air, enabling creatures
inside it to breathe normally.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Transmute Water to Dust:</I> Casting this spell underwater causes a &quot;hole&quot; to open in a previously
water-filled area. The size of the &quot;hole&quot; is up to 10 cubic feet per level of the
caster. Assuming there is sufficient surrounding water-- that is, if the spell was
not cast on or near the surface of the water-- the unaffected water will rush
in, inflicting 1 hit point of damage per level of the caster to all within (no
saving throw).
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>7th Level</B>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Monster Summoning V:</I> Only creatures that can breathe and function underwater can be summoned. (If
available, the DM should use the appropriate Aquatic Monster Summoning table in
the <I>Monstrous Compendium</I>.)
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion:</I> At the caster's option, the mansion can be filled with water, or the influx
of water can be prevented, keeping the mansion's interior tidy and dry.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>8th Level
<P></P>
</B>
<P></P>
<I>Monster Summoning VI:</I> Only creatures that can breathe and function underwater can be summoned. (If
available, the DM should use the appropriate Aquatic Monster Summoning table in
the Monstrous Compendium. )
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Sink:</I> This spell places the subject a specified number of feet beneath the floor of
the lake, ocean, or sea. The magic of the containment will radiate through the
water to the surface.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>9th Level</B>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Monster Summoning VII:</I> Only creatures that can breathe and function underwater can be summoned. (If
available, the DM should use the appropriate Aquatic Monster Summoning table in
the <I>Monstrous Compendium</I>.)
