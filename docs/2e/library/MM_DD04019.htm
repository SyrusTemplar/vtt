</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Half-Ogre
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">When adventuring companies journey into the wilderness they often run into
ogres; big, ugly humanoids. Occasionally, an ogre party will include one or two
individuals that are a little shorter, but significantly smarter, wielding a
weapon with more skill than might have been expected. They have a better
understanding of their opponents, and they grunt commands that anticipate the
adventurers' moves. In this way half-breeds, the issue of ogres and humans, earn the
respect of their kind.
<P></P>
Half-ogres range from 7 to 8 feet in height and weigh from 315 to 425 pounds.
Skin and hair color are variable, but tend toward brown, gray, black, dull
yellow (skin only), or any of the above with a slight gray-green tint. Teeth and
nails are always orange. Most half-ogres have human-like eyes, though about one
in five have the white pupils common to ogres. Their odor is noticeable, but it
is not as overpowering as that of a full-blooded ogre. The half-ogre
traditionally wears heavy skins and furs, bringing his Armor Class up to that of his ogre
brethren, but rare individuals have the ability to make a shirt of chain-mail,
for an AC of 3. Half-ogres speak common (more clearly and unimpeded than
ogres), ogrish, orcish, troll, and one other, usually human, language. They live
about 110 years.
<P></P>
Half-ogres posses infravision out to 60 feet. Their sense of smell is better
than an ogre's, but it falls short of a human's.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Half-ogres of any sort suffer -2 penalties to their attack rolls against
dwarves and -4 against gnomes, since those smaller races are so skilled at battling
bigger folk.
<P></P>
Half-ogres in combat are often found with full-blooded ogres. If so, the
half-ogre will most likely be leading the ogre party. The ogres fight more wisely
when led by a half-ogre that concentrates assaults on characters it recognizes as
spellcasters, and teaming up against skilled fighters. Ambushes are
better-planned and more carefully baited.
<P></P>
To earn command privileges, particularly when ogre leaders are present, a
half-ogre must show himself quick to battle and fierce in combat. Half-ogres' usual
weapon of choice is a huge sword (use the statistics for a two-handed bastard
sword, save that half-ogres can employ it one-handed, with a large shield in
the other), or a war spear capable of causing 2d4 points of damage. A half-ogre
inflicts an additional 2 points of damage, due to his mass.
<P></P>
Half-ogres sometimes gather together to form their own tribes. In this case,
they will be encountered in bands of 2d10 and will expend as much energy
choosing and preparing an ambush as on the combat itself.
<P></P>
For every five half-ogres in an encounter, there is an additional veteran with
5+3 Hit Dice. For every 10 half-ogres, there is a kader with 6 Hit Dice. If
more than 15 half-ogres are encountered, they will have a shaman, a
fighter/priest with 5 + 3 Hit Dice and the spells of a 4th-level priest, and two acolyte
shamans, with 4+6 Hit Dice and the spells of a 2nd-level priest.
<P></P>
Half-ogres are inclined to intimidate others. A broad, fang-filled smile and
perhaps a slamming fist, often encourages an NPC to suddenly remember
appointments, or perhaps faint dead away. Kobolds will clutch their spears and cringe in
unison when 7'6'' of solid muscle smashes their door to splinters and storms
in; even larger monsters have serious reservations about attacking half-ogres.
They will also terrify local human populations into leaving a half-ogre and his
companions alone.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Half-ogres have no society of their own. If they live with ogres, they are the
quick-thinking members of the tribe, ever on their toes to prove themselves
worthy. If a half-ogre is reared in a human community, he learns to live with
suspicion and fear, and often turns to a military or solitary occupation.
<P></P>
Occasionally, half-ogres join with half-orcs, orogs, ogrillons, and other
humanoids. These communities are small (5-200 residents) and usually isolated, but
can appear in virtually any terrain. Half-ogres fill a middle niche -- more
powerful than half-orcs or orogs, but smarter than ogrillons, trolls, and other
humanoids. As a whole, these communities are chaotic evil, with neutral
tendencies stemming from the level of cooperation necessary in a &quot;half-caste&quot; situation.
They prefer others of their own kind, and are tolerant of orcs and ogres.
Enough of them have human blood that they regard humans with neutrality. Indeed,
chaotic evil humans often find their most enthusiastic followers in such a hybrid
tribe. They also tolerate monstrous humanoids such as trolls and giants, but
all other races are treated with undisguised hostility.
<P></P>
Hybrid settlements raid civilized territories for prisoners and loot. A
settlement may be found holding prisoners. It is also likely for treasure to be found
in a hybrid camp. Half-ogres are usually cheated out of most of their rightful
treasure shares by the more cunning orogs and half-orcs.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Sages have expressed much concern over the years, wondering why ogres can
interbreed with humans but not with elves or halflings. When the actual answer was
discovered, the sages' concerns proved unfounded. The explanation had nothing
to do with any supposed common origin of humans and ogres, but rather in a
unusual characteristic that ogres share with orcs: rapidly adaptive biology. Just as
orcs and ogres can adapt quickly to any terrain, from forests to the highest
mountains, their genetic construction allows them breed with any humanoid race.
<P></P>
This ability to breed easily is frequently passed on to their progeny.
Half-ogres can also breed successfully with most other humanoid races. If this process
continues for many generations, the result is a horrible hybrid known as a <I>mongrelman.</I> Many mongrelmen have strong strains of orc and ogre in their bloodlines,
which may account for their chaotic evil attitudes.
<P></P>
The half-ogre shares the ogre's place in the ecosystem: that of a plague upon
demihumans and humans, lusting for treasure and making neither crafts nor good
labor. The beginnings of half-ogre poetry have been around for many years, but
it is exceptionally ugly and disturbing.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Half-Ogres as NPCs or PCs
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Half-ogres may be NPCs or even PCs, with DM's consent. If so, they have
statistics determined in the following fashion. Strength is ld6 +13, with a roll of 6
being treated as 18(00) strength. Characters with a Strength roll of 5 (18
strength) should roll normally for extraordinary strength. Dexterity is 3d4.
Constitution is ld6 +13, with a roll of 6 being treated as an 18. Intelligence is
3d4. Wisdom is 2d6. Charisma is 2d4, doubled for effective Charisma with respect
to ogres, half-ogres, orcs, orogs, and other humanoids. Half-ogres reared
outside of the tribes do not gain the languages mentioned earlier. Player character
half-ogres may not be exclusively priests, but may practice any other class
allowed half-ogres. Starting Hit Dice are doubled at 1st level, progressing
normally at 2nd level and above.
<P></P>
As NPCs, shaman half-ogres are fighter/priests. Also possible are half-ogres
that function solely as priests, rising to 8th level, and rarely seen
fighter/thieves (3+9 Hit Dice with the skills of 1st- or 2nd-level thieves). Half-ogre
thieves are always self-taught, and accept the following racial adjustments: Pick
Pockets -20%, Open Locks +5%, Find/Remove Traps +0%, Move Silently -5%, Hide
in Shadows +5%, Detect Noise +0%, Climb Walls -30%, Read Languages -25%.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ogrillon
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The ogrillon is a fiercer species of the half-ogre, being the fruit of a union
between ogres and orcs. The ogrillon displays the general tendencies of its
larger cousin with some exceptions. It is even more brutish and violent, and it
normally learns to speak only ogrish and a handful of words in common.
<P></P>
The ogrillon is the size of an orc, and closely resembles one. One in every
ten is born with features and coloration very similar to those of ogres: purple
eyes with white pupils, black teeth, yellowish skin with dull, dark green hair.
The skin of an ogrillon of either type is covered with small horn plates,
giving it a superior Armor Class and enabling it to fight without weapons. An
ogrillon disdains armor and most other material items, retaining only a handful of
gold pieces as treasured belongings. It is uncertain why they would keep gold,
except perhaps as good luck charms.
<P></P>
They love mayhem. In combat they disdain weapons and plunge in with both
fists. Due to their great strength and horn-reinforced fists, each punch delivers
ld6+1 points of damage. An ogrillon out of combat is restless and troubled, but
it will be seen chuckling merrily to itself during a good fight.
<P></P>
Because of their single-mindedness, ogrillons are often approached by orcs
when they need good fighters against some enemy. Ogrillons are happy to join and
fight, sometimes for the love of combat and destruction, but often for more
lucky gold pieces. In combat, there is only a 10% chance that a typical ogrillon
can be distinguished from an orc. Ogrillons that resemble ogres, of course,
clearly stand out.
<P></P>
Ogrillons are the issue of a female orc mated with a male ogre. Thankfully, it
is sterile. The union of a male orc and a female ogre yields an orog, a better
class of humanoid monster detailed in the &quot;Orc&quot; entry.
