<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Your battlefield should now be complete. Chances are, you have some defensible
terrain and some open areas that invite attack. Now, the DM should decide
where each force starts. If one side surprises the other, the surprised fellows
have to set up first, and the surprising force gets to set up around them. If one
side was stationary or defending, they set up along one randomly-determined map
edge, and the attackers set up opposite them.
<P></P>
If both forces were moving, roll randomly to see which edge of the mapboard
each force was coming from. They can enter the encounter area from adjacent sides
of the battle map, but not from the same side. If the players have a set
marching order, the DM can insist that they set up their figures accordingly. Or, if
the circumstances dictate, he can allow them to place their figures wherever
they see fit.
<P></P>
Please note that the simple creation of a battlefield does not guarantee a
more exciting and interesting encounter-the DM has to reward characters who use
their heads by making use of the terrain, and present the party with enemies who
do the same. Even a grizzled party of adventurers should think twice before
going up a rocky hillside against a band of orcs who can see them coming.
