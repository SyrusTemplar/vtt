<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Barbarian</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The barbarian is perhaps the most common fantasy-fiction archetype.
Powerfully built, immensely strong, and clad in furs and skins, the barbarian often is
seen as a muscle-bound bully. However, barbarians are more than that. They
arrive in the campaign’s setting from some distant, primitive land where people
must still fight the environment at every turn just to survive. Playing a
barbarian is all about working the mystique of a primitive culture into a more
“civilized” world.

the social or economical ladder of the civilized community they are now a part
of. Roll 2d6 to determine the barbarian’s rank.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Requirements:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Barbarians must have minimum Strength/Stamina and Constitution/Health scores
of 13. The barbarian kit is barred to paladins, clerics, and bards. This kit is
open to all player character races.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Barbarians prefer simple, large, and dependable weapons. Suggested weapons
include: axe (all), sword (all), club, dagger, knife, war hammer, mace, sling,
spear, javelin, long bow, and quarterstaff. The following weapons are likely
inappropriate for barbarians—at least until they are immersed in a new
culture—crossbow (all), polearms (all), flail (all), lances (all).
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended nonweapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Endurance, animal handling, animal training, bowyer/fletcher, fire-building,
fishing, riding (land-based), hunting, mountaineering, running, survival,
tracking.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Equipment:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> A barbarian cannot initially purchase armor heavier than splint mail, banded
mail, or bronze plate mail. Of course, once exposed to superior forms of armor
in the campaign, the barbarian may choose to purchase other armor types.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended traits:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Alertness, direction sense, immunities, keen senses, light sleeper, weather
sense.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Benefits/Hindrances:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Barbarians are intense, and NPCs tend to have very strong reactions to them.
People either are drawn by the barbarian’s animal magnetism or repulsed by his
primitive qualities. This effect comes into play when NPCs meet barbarians for
the first time. If the NPC’s reaction roll result is 8 or less, an additional
–2 bonus is applied to the result. For example, if the character is acting
indifferently toward a shopkeeper and the shopkeeper’s reaction result is a 7, the
shopkeeper is <I>indifferent</I>. However, since the character is a barbarian, the –2 bonus applies, lowering
the shopkeeper’s result to a 5—a <I>friendly</I> response. The shopkeeper has been won over by the barbarian’s presence.
However, if the shopkeeper’s reaction roll was a 14 or higher, the modifier becomes
a +2 penalty, resulting in a 16—<I>threatening</I>—score. For more information on reaction results, see the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00563.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00563.htm.php.html">Dungeon Master Guide</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>.

</I> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wealth:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> A barbarian begins with the standard amount of money for his class, but all
of it must be spent before play begins. The DM might allow the Barbarian to
retain a few silver pieces or a handful of coppers, but not much more.
