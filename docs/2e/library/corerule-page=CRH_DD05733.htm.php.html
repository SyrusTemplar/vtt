<FONT SIZE="3">A ranger who reaches 8th level can learn and use
certain spells. Unlike a wizard, he doesn't need a spell book, nor
does he need to roll to learn spells. Instead, he obtains spells like
a priest, acquiring the spells he wants to memorize through
meditation and prayer. Chapter 8 examines the relationship between
rangers, priests, and faiths in more detail.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike priests, rangers have access to
spells only from the animal and plant spheres. As shown on Table 5 in
Chapter 1, a ranger can cast spells at an increasingly higher level
as he himself advances in level; a 9th-level ranger casts spells as a
2nd-level caster, while a 12th-level ranger casts spells as a
5th-level caster. Also note that a ranger can choose to memorize <I>any</I>
plant or animal sphere spell of the level shown on Table 5; for
instance, a 13th-level ranger can have any three 1st-level spells
from the plant and animal spheres and any two 2nd-level spells from
the plant and animal spheres memorized at one time.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; This chapter presents several new spells
that the ranger should find especially useful, along with a few new
magical items. For quick reference, Table 56 lists all spells
available to the ranger. <B>Bold-face</B> spells are described in
this chapter; the rest are detailed in the <I>Player's Handbook.</I></FONT></P>
