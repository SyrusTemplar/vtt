<B>Key Idiosyncrasies: </B>Septien has an infamous &quot;ego signature,&quot; as explained below. He also has a
real loathing of dwarves, and his shortsword is his most treasured magical item.
He does not attempt to expel dwarves from his guild, but they do not advance
easily, and Septien has even shopped one or two to the law by anonymous tip-offs.
<P></P>
<B>Cover:</B> Septien is a well-known and appreciated musician who gives well-attended
public performances of his playing on harpsichord-like instruments.
<P></P>
<B>Guild and Leadership:</B> The Gryrax Guild has a complex/mix structure; the guildmaster co-rules with a
ruling council of three. Septien's style of guildmastering is slightly weak
(he shares power), just, and fairly populist (the council attends to general
feelings within the guild and Septien listens to them).
<P></P>
<B>History:</B> Septien Selfareine is Guildmaster in Gryrax of the Principality of Ulek, of
Oerth (in the World of Greyhawk). His identity as guildmaster is known only to
the three members of the ruling council of this guild; he is known to everyone
else as &quot;White Lily.&quot; This pseudonym comes from a weakness he has for leaving a
fresh white lily at the scene of his audacious burglaries.
<P></P>
Septien was born the illegitimate son of a minor female elven noble in Celene,
where such a birth is no stigma. The half-elf's quick wits and skill soon
brought him private training in magic from his doting mother, and he began
adventuring early in life. The evils of the Pomarj, so close to Celene, offered ample
opportunity for a mage to gain experience and prosper. But Septien's
light-fingered talents found employment in the tolerant, liberal capital of Celene as well.
<P></P>
Septien made happy progress as mage and thief, all the while cultivating his
social graces and musicianship. It took the ravages of a broken love affair with
a haughty grey elf ballerina to drive Septien first to drink and then to
exile. Septien grew lazy, fat, and depressed in the lands of Ulek, until the day his
second love entered his lifeâ€”the White Lily Diamond. Found in the Kron Hills,
bought by the Prince of Ulek and exhibited at the Gryrax Palace of Culture, the
heavily-guarded diamond was irresistible. Septien brought off a daring
robbery, and left a flower behind; the origins of his name. He privately sold the gem
back to the Prince for 25,000 gp, a fraction of its value, later. Septien does
not want riches. He does not steal for the wealth. He steals for the joy of
being skilled and smart enough to get away with it.
<P></P>
Septien avoided joining the thieves' guild for some years, but bumped into the
acting guildmaster when the two decided to rob the same place at the same
time. Septien was just putting his flower in place when the second thief arrived!
The old guildmaster had just died, and to have the famous White Lily as
guildmaster was a decision which unified the squabbling and divided membership and
ruling council. Septien was drafted in, and somewhat regrets this. In truth, there
is little burden on him, since the council makes all the day-to-day decisions
and his freedom of action is little curtailed. But Septien regrets the day his
identity was discovered. On the other hand, his increasing success as a musician
(he is much in demand for concerts and as an accompanist) brings him good
fees, public acclaim, and a steady rate of arrival of hopeful females at his
secluded town house. There is word of his being made a Court Companion, the formal
title given to an adviser to the Prince, who is thought to seek his views on
elven and cultural affairs.
<P></P>
<B> Septien in Game Play:</B> As &quot;White Lily,&quot; Septien is the classic mystery figure. PCs may have a wild
range of adventures trying to find him, stop his robberies, foil his schemes,
etc. Putting PCs up against an enemy who will only wish to outsmart them, and
will never kill unless he is forced to, will make a nice change of atmosphere. A
medium-level thief needing training in Ulek might find that only Septien can
train him, and part of the guildmaster's terms might be that the PC will have to
find him first! Given his concerts, his liking for female company, and his
activity as a mage (although he is not a member of the Mages guild of Ulek), there
are several ways in which PCs can meet Septien while, at the same time, hunting
the infamous White Lily!
<P></P>
<B> Tactical Notes:</B> With his amulet, Septien is almost impossible to scry. Adding his <I>ring of chameleon</I> power to his thief skills makes this no easier. His major advantage is his
amazing ability to get into and out of places, and with spells such as <I>wizard eye</I> he does his best to scry places in advance. <I>Nolzur's marvellous pigments</I> are ideal for getting into places (hey presto! a door!) if Septien's half-elf
skill and wand don't find the secret doors.
<P></P>
Septien does not use aggressive, damaging evocation-type spells and the like
if at all possible. He prefers subtlety and guile, and a spell such as<I> spectral force</I> to cover his escapes (using<I> teleport</I> to his villa in dire necessity). Septien is not strong and has few hit
points, and so he will avoid melee combat if possible. If he must fight, unleashing
his <I>longsword of dancing</I> while he fights with his magical shortsword can make him quite formidable.
However, his <I>cloak of displacement</I> makes it virtually certain that he will be able to escape at least a first
blow in melee, and he often takes advantage of this to<I> teleport</I> (or <I>dimension door</I> if he has this spell memorized, having scried in advance with <I>wizard eye</I>) away. His magical boots also enable him to make fast escapes.
