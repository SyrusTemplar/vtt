<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Religion:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Characters with religion proficiency know the common beliefs and cults of
their homeland and the major faiths of neighboring regions. Ordinary information
(type of religious symbol used, basic attitude of the faith, etc.) of any
religion is automatically known by the character. Special information, such as how the
clergy is organized or the significance of particular holy days, requires a
proficiency check.
<P></P>
Additional proficiencies spent on religion enable the character either to
expand his general knowledge into more distant regions (using the guidelines above)
or to gain precise information about a single faith. If the latter is chosen,
the character is no longer required to make a proficiency check when answering
questions about that religion. Such expert knowledge is highly useful to priest
characters when dealing with their own and rival faiths.
