By means of this spell, the caster (or any other creature whose levels of
experience or Hit Dice do not exceed the wizard's own level) can be put into a
cataleptic state that is impossible to distinguish from death. Although the person
or creature affected by the <I>feign death</I> spell can smell, hear, and know what is going on, no feeling or sight of any
sort is possible. Thus, any wounding or mistreatment of the body is not felt
and no reaction occurs; damage is only half normal. In addition, paralysis,
poison, and energy-level drain cannot affect an individual under the influence of
this spell. Poison injected or otherwise introduced into the body takes effect
when the spell recipient is no longer under the influence of this spell, although
a saving throw is permitted.
<P></P>
Note that only a willing individual can be affected by a <I>feign death</I> spell. The spellcaster can end the spell effects at any time desired, as will
a successful dispel, but a full round is required for bodily functions to
begin again.
