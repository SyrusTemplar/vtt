A single-class Warrior can take more than one Style Specialization. Weapons
such as Bastard Sword, Javelin, and Spear, which can be used one-handed or
two-handed, with or without a shield, can have up to four different Style
Specializations taken for them.
<P></P>
<I>Example: A single-class Warrior has Proficiency with Bastard Sword. He could
theoretically take Single-Weapon Style Specialization, Two-Hander Style
Specialization, Weapon and Shield Style Specialization, and Two-Weapon Style
Specialization with it. Between fights, or even in the course of the fight, he could
change the way he uses his weapon in order to gain different advantages in the
course of a combat.
