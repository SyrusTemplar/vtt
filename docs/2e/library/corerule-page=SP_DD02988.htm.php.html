<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Peasant Hero</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> A Peasant hero is the “local kid done good.” Whatever his class, whatever
his ambitions, this character always remembers that his roots are in the soil of
his home—be it a bustling village, a quiet hamlet, or a lone farm miles from
the nearest neighbors. He might leave his home and become a great general, a
mighty wizard, a noble priest, or a master thief—but his home will always be
foremost in his heart. A peasant hero might fight against tyrannical nobles who are
oppressing the common people, or he could simply yearn for the wealth of the
nobles—so he can return to his village and build homes, temples, schools, and more.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Benefits:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The disadvantaged often make it through the rough times by helping each
other. Therefore, in his homeland, a peasant hero always will be given shelter and
any other help his fellows can give. They will hide him and his friends from an
evil ruler’s troops, heal his wounds, and feed and clothe him. Of course, this
is conditional—if the peasant hero has given up his down-to-earth ways or
mistreats his former friends, he’ll find all doors in the village closed to him.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hindrances: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As he is viewed as something of a hero, a peasant hero will find the people of
his homeland coming to him for assistance. If livestock are disappearing from
the pens, or the village elder has been jailed for speaking against the nobles,
or if another peasant is accused of crime he didn’t commit, the peasant hero
will be called upon to help.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wealth:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Peasant heroes begin with half the starting maximum gold allowed for their
adventuring class.
