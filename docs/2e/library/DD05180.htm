In the Myrmidons campaign, the player-characters are all heroes with the
Myrmidon Warrior Kit. They're either part of an elite unit in a regular army or
guard, or they're a small, efficient mercenary team who've worked together for
years (before the campaign began, that is).
<P></P>
This campaign is best suited to providing the characters with interesting
military and tactical situations.
<P></P>
For example, in one adventure, their superiors/employers instruct them to
rescue a kidnapped ambassador from an old, abandoned fort that is now occupied by
bandit/kidnappers. The heroes are given a map of the place, a certain amount of
gold for equipment, and a deadline (never more than a few days). They have to
work out all the plans of the assault and rescue, then go in, retrieve the
kidnapee, and escape with him unharmed if they're to get their money or the
commendation of their superiors.
<P></P>
In other adventures, the characters' unit might be part of a much larger
military force fighting a long-standing war; some adventures will be stand-up
combats with enemy troops, some will be reconnaissance missions behind enemy lines,
some will be rest and recreation binges in nearby civilian towns.
<P></P>
In most cases, the players should have the opportunity to plan out their own
military operations. This gives them a greater sense of satisfaction when the
plans succeed . . .and a better understanding of how things work in the
game-world when the plans fail.
<P></P>
Obviously, this is a very pro-military campaign setting, and the PCs and their
NPC friends won't tolerate differing outlooks. Minor villains in this campaign
include officers who know less about military operations than the PCs, or
officers who deliberately sacrifice subordinates in order to gain success and
promotions; so are civilians who rabidly oppose the ongoing conflict, those who are
disrespectful of soldiers, etc.
