<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Rod of Rulership:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The individual who possesses this magic rod is able to command the obedience
and fealty of creatures within 120 feet when he or she activates the device.
From 200 to 500 Hit Dice (or levels of experience) can be ruled, but creatures
with 15 or greater Intelligence and 12 or more Hit Dice/levels are entitled to a
saving throw vs. spell. Ruled creatures will obey the wielder of the <I>rod of rulership</I> as if he or she were their absolute sovereign. Still if the wielder gives a
command that is absolutely contrary to the nature of the creatures commanded,
the magic will be broken. The rod has a casting time of 5. Each charge lasts for
one turn. The rod cannot be recharged.
