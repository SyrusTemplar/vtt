What types of requests do not warrant a Power granting a quest spell?
Generally, a quest spell is not needed for events which affect only a minor sphere of
interest for the deity and events that are part of normal Prime Material
conflict; a senior priest being killed by an agent of an evil Power isn't enough to
justify the use of a quest spell. Any problem that has limited scale or should
resolve itself in time through the normal efforts of priests does not need quest
magic.
<P></P>
The DM must consider whether a problem is out of the ordinary. Only under
extraordinary circumstances should a quest spell be granted. If the DM is in doubt,
a simple question may provide the answer: Could the problem have a fair chance
of resolution through the use of upper-level priest spells if wisely used?
Only if the answer is &quot;no&quot; should quest magic be considered.
