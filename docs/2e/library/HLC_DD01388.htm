</B>Demihumans in High-Level Play </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Demihuman characters are usually forced to retire or assume secondary roles in
the campaign once human player characters begin to reach high levels and the
demihuman characters reach their advancement limits. That is exactly what is
supposed to happen. Many DMs are tempted to ignore demihuman advancement limits,
especially when players are unwilling to retire their high-level demihuman
characters.
<P></P>
Do not ignore demihuman advancement limits; they are the price players must
pay for gaining demihuman advantages at lower levels. Ignoring the advancement
limits unbalances play by placing high-level power in the hands of characters who
already have extra abilities, and it is grossly unfair to players who have
chosen human characters and have labored long and hard to get to the point where
their choices begin to pay dividends in the form of unlimited advancement.
