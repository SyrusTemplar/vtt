<FONT SIZE="3">This spell calls into being a curtain or field of
water that remains intact and upright in defiance of gravity. The
wall lasts as long as the wizard chooses to concentrate on
maintaining it or one round per level if the wizard chooses not to
concentrate on holding it together. The caster may shape the <I>wall
of water </I>in one of three ways:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>A. Water Curtain. </B>In this form, the wizard
conjures one plane of water, 5 feet square and 1 foot thick, per
experience level; for example, a 5th-level caster can create five
5-foot x 5-foot x 1-foot wall sections that would be enough to block
an arched passageway 15 feet wide and 10 feet high with a curtain of
water 1 foot thick. The curtain&#146;s lower edge must rest upon the
ground, but it need not be anchored on either side, and it remains
cohesive and upright for the duration of the spell. Once raised, the
wall cannot be moved.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>B. Hemisphere. </B>In this manifestation, the <I>wall
of water </I>forms a dome 1 foot thick over the caster, with an
inner radius equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level; a
7th-level caster could create a dome with a 10-foot radius. The wall
must rest upon the ground. The dome is immobile.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>C. Sphere. </B>If cast underwater, the caster may
shape the <I>wall of water </I>into a sphere 1 foot thick, with an
inner radius equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level (no air is
in the sphere). The sphere is centered on the caster and moves with him.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">In any form, the wall of water has two primary
effects. First of all, missile fire through the wall is next to
impossible, suffering a &#150;4 attack penalty for each foot of
thickness as well as a &#150;1 damage penalty for every two feet of
thickness. Creatures gain a +1 bonus to saving throws against attack
spells that must pass through the wall. If the spell allows no saving
throw, none is granted by the <I>wall of water</I>. Secondly,
physical passage through the wall is hindered; any creature trying to
pass through must take one full round to do so and becomes soaked to
the skin in the process.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The <I>wall of water </I>can be defeated or bypassed
by a number of spells or effects. At the end of the spell&#146;s
duration, the water loses its cohesiveness and collapses, which may
surprise those sheltering under the hemisphere or standing next to
the curtain. Note that the water itself may be fresh water (25%
chance), salt water (50% chance), or brackish (25% chance), although
the sphere will always be composed of the water type that surrounds
it. The material component is a vial full of blessed spring water.</FONT></P>
