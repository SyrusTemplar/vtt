Known as the most common type of priest, a cleric makes a suitable
representative for a variety of powers. A cleric is both a sturdy soldier with formidable
spell powers and a defender of the faith and proselytizer; overall, he is the
most versatile and well-rounded priest character. Clerics with a Wisdom score of
16 or better earn a 10% bonus to the experience they gain. A cleric may be of
any alignment acceptable to his patron deity.
