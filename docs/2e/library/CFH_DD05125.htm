The text on <A HREF="PHB_DD01604.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01604.htm">Weaponsmithing</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> proficiency from the Player?s Handbook is basically correct, but let's
elaborate on it.
<P></P>
As mentioned, a weaponsmith does need to have a <I>smithy</I>. The costs for having a smithy are given above in this section, under
&quot;Armorer.&quot; In fact, the same smithy can be used for armoring and weaponsmithing.
<P></P>
The Weapon Construction numbers on <A HREF="PHB_DD01609.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01609.htm">Weapon Construction table</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> on page 65 of the <I>Player's Handbook</I> are correct. It constitutes one Overseer-level weaponsmith working by himself
and crafting weapons of average quality. An Overseer weaponsmith working with
two apprentices cuts the time in half. The time indicated on the chart should
be converted to weeks so that you can compare the weaponsmith's times with the
armorer's; consider 5 days on the chart to constitute one week.
