without a proficiency check. Additional objects can be added, but a check is
required; use a –1 modifier for each item beyond the fourth. Checks are also required
for spectacular feats, such as juggling lighted torches or whirling scimitars,
with failure meaning that 1d4 items are dropped. The potential for damage or
disaster is left to the DM.

This skill is primarily useful for entertainment or diversions, though
characters with the juggling proficiency have a chance to catch small objects—such as
darts or daggers—that are thrown at them. They must be facing the source of the
attack to make such an attempt, and they must make a proficiency check with a
–2 modifier. Failure means they are automatically hit by the thrown objects.
