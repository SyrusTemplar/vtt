<FONT SIZE="3">This awful spell brings into existence a short-lived <I>sphere
of annihilation </I>(as described in Appendix 3 of the </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD01054.htm.php.html">DMG</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">).
The sphere is a black ball of nothingness about 2 feet in diameter
that instantly and utterly destroys any matter that comes into
contact with it. The <I>sphere </I>appears anywhere in the
spell&#146;s range and moves up to 15 feet per round as the wizard
directs. If the wizard attempts to bring the sphere into contact with
a living creature, the potential victim gains a saving throw vs.
breath weapon to dodge aside, but a victim who is unaware of the <I>sphere&#146;s
</I>appearance or unable to move is destroyed without a saving throw.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Once conjured, the<I> sphere of ultimate destruction </I>may
not move exactly as the caster wishes. The wizard has a 75% chance
to control it, plus 1% per point of Intelligence over 12 and 3% for
each point over 15. In other words, a wizard with an Intelligence of
18 would gain a +12% bonus to his chance to control the <I>sphere</I>.
If the wizard fails to control the <I>sphere </I>in any given round,
it automatically moves directly towards him at its maximum speed of
15 feet per round. Unlike the magical item, another wizard may not
contest the caster&#146;s control of a <I>sphere </I>of ultimate
destruction unless the second wizard possesses a <I>talisman of the sphere</I>.
(See the </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD01060.htm.php.html">DMG</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> .)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Should a <I>gate </I>spell be cast upon the sphere,
there is a 50% chance that the <I>sphere </I>is destroyed, a 35%
chance that nothing happens, and a 15% chance that a gap is torn in
the spatial fabric, catapulting everything in a 180-foot radius to
another plane of existence. If the sphere is touched by a <I>rod of cancellation</I>,
a tremendous explosion inflicts 3d4 x 10 points of damage to
everything within 60 feet as the two forces negate each other. No
other spell or magical item has any effect on a <I>sphere of ultimate destruction</I>.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">There is a 5% chance that any particular manifestation
of this spell does not cause a victim&#146;s utter destruction but
instead transports him to a random plane of existence. The conjuring
wizard has no way of knowing whether he has destroyed his enemy or
merely blasted him into some remote dimension. The material component
of this spell is a dark crystal ball that has been on the Ethereal
Plane and that can be comfortably held in two hands.</FONT></P>
