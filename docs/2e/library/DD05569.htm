<P></P>
This god represents the performing arts -- vocal and instrumental music,
traditional and interpretive dance, even stage tragedy and comedy. He is closely
related to the gods of arts and of literature/poetry, and is the favorite god of
bards.
<P></P>
His priests are devoted to the advancement of music and dance in the
population. They organize events where music is played, dances are performed, and plays
are enacted. Sometimes they tour as part of theatrical companies, among bards
and other performers. Their quest is to bring light to others through the
performing arts.
<P></P>
Lesser gods of this attribute concentrate on only one of his aspects. One god
might be the deity of vocal music, another the deity of wild, frantic dances,
another the god of ballet.
<P></P>
A god who encompasses all the aspects of music and dance is probably going to
be male. Gods of individual aspects are more likely to be female.

Crafts, Culture, Divinity of Mankind, Light, Literature/Poetry, Metalwork, and
