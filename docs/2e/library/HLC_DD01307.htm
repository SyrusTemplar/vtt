<P></P>
The character engaged to oversee a magical duel is the person who decides how
isolated the combatants are. A fairly impenetrable defensive spell, such as <I>prismatic sphere</I> or a hemispherical <I>wall or force</I>, insures that no one can easily disrupt the proceedings. A fairly weak spell,
such as<I> protection from evil 10? radius</I>, offers the combatants very little protection.
<P></P>
The mediator-s secondary roll is keeping things honest. It is his
responsibility to make sure the combatants do not employ magical items in an attempt to
gain an unfair advantage. It is traditional for the mediator to search each
combatant for contraband before construction of the arena begins. Prohibited items
are usually confiscated and held until the duel is completed. Careful mediators
usually insist on physically searching each combatant to foil <I>nondetection </I>spells and <I>amulets of proof against detection and location</I>, which can defeat divination spells.
<P></P>
The mediator can end the arena construction process just by touching one of
the combatants. The mediator can end the duel itself in a similar manner. A
dedicated mediator resists attempts to disturb the combatants, but mediators with
less resolve have been known to flee when challenged.
<P></P>
The mediator knows how much time each caster spends contributing spells to the
arena, and some judges have been known to intervene, ending the duel for good
or for ill.
<P></P>
The mediator is under no special compulsions toward fairness or honesty unless
duelists take precautions. A <I>geas </I>spell can help insure a mediator-s fairness, but powerful characters can
usually avoid the worst effects of violating the <I>geas</I>. It is best if both combatants agree on a mediator they can trust.
<P></P>
If the protective spell the mediator casts over the duelists is large enough,
the character can include himself in the spell and be protected along with the
combatants. Some spells, such as <I>prismatic sphere</I>, allow the caster free passage in and out, which makes them ideal for
mediators who want to keep an eye on the situation outside the arena as well as the
battle taking place in the arena.
