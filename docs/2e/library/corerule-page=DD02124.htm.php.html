This spell enables the priest to command another creature with a single word.
The command must be uttered in a language understood by the creature. The
subject will obey to the best of his/its ability only as long as the command is
absolutely clear and unequivocal; thus, a command of “Suicide!” is ignored. A
command to “Die!” causes the creature to fall in a faint or cataleptic state for one
round, but thereafter the creature revives and is alive and well. Typical
commands are back, halt, flee, run, stop, fall, go, leave, surrender, sleep, rest,
etc. No command affects a creature for more than one round; undead are not
affected at all. Creatures with Intelligence of 13 (high) or more, or those with 6
or more Hit Dice (or experience levels) are entitled to a saving throw vs.
spell, adjusted for Wisdom. (Creatures with 13 or higher Intelligence <I>and</I> 6 Hit Dice/levels get only one saving throw!)
