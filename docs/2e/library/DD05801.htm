<P></P>
<P></P>
Each type of thief described in this chapter is defined by means of a kit. A
kit is made up of the following elements, following the style of the warrior
kits in the AD&amp;D? 2nd Edition<I> Complete Fighter's Manual:
<P></P>
</I>
<P></P>
<I>Description:</I> The kit explains the thief type, describing the typical appearance, manner,
cultural background, and use of the character in a campaign. It also lists any
requirements necessary for a character to take the kit.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Role:</I> Many of these thief types arise in particular social contexts. A Fence, for
instance, exists because other thieves need to market stolen goods. The kit will
therefore describe the role of the Fence in his society, and may suggest how
he might function in relation to the rest of the fantasy adventure campaign.
<P></P>
Under &quot;Role&quot; you will also find notes on the personalities or backgrounds
typical for thieves of this kit. This reflects our earlier discussion of
&quot;role-playing thieves,&quot; where we examined setting, social background and motivations, and
presented a few thief archetypes.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Secondary Skills:</I> If you have chosen to use the Secondary Skills rules from AD&amp;D? 2nd Edition
(see <I>Player's Handbook</I>, <A HREF="PHB_DD01535.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01535.htm">p. 53</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">), then your kit may require your thief to take a specific skill, or choose
from a limited range of choices. You might not be able to choose or roll randomly
from among all the secondary skills listed in the <I>Player's Handbook</I>.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Weapon Proficiencies:</I> If you're using the weapon proficiency rules from AD&amp;D? 2nd Edition, then
your kit could require your thief to take specific weapon proficiencies. Or, he
might have to choose one from a limited range; the Bandit, for instance, is
required to take one bludgeoning weapon.
<P></P>
Some kits (Assassins, for example) are permitted a wider range of weapons than
normal thieves. This, too, is noted under weapon proficiencies.
<P></P>
Unlike nonweapon proficiencies, below, weapon proficiencies required for a
thief kit are NOT bonuses unless otherwise specified. They must be taken to fill
the weapon proficiency slots normally given to a first level thief.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</I> If you have chosen to use the nonweapon proficiency rules from AD&amp;D? 2nd
Edition, then you will find useful the information in each kit on what
proficiencies are required or recommended for that sort of thief. The Bounty Hunter, for
instance, is required to take the tracking proficiency; and a number of other
proficiencies related to wilderness survival and tracking down people are
recommended.
<P></P>
Note that required proficiencies are bonuses, given in addition to the
nonweapon proficiency choices that you may make as usual. Sometimes a bonus
proficiency will come from a group other than the General or Thief groups, but (since it
is a bonus anyway) it doesn't matter how many extra slots it would otherwise be
required to occupy.
<P></P>
When a proficiency is only recommended in a thief kit, it is not given
automatically to the character. If the character decides to take a recommended
nonweapon proficiency, it is chosen to fill one of the thief's open slots. Beginning
thieves should have no more than one nonweapon proficiency that is not among
those recommended or required for their kit.
<P></P>
So let us suppose we have a bounty hunter named Baltrin. As a first level
thief, Baltrin starts with three nonweapon proficiency slots. In addition, for
choosing the Bounty Hunter kit, he gets Tracking as a bonus proficiency. Two of his
three nonweapon proficiency slots must be spent on proficiencies that are
recommended for his kit; he chooses alertness and riding (land-based). His final
slot may be filled with any one-slot proficiency that he desires. The player
chooses carpentry, deciding that Baltrin came from a family of carpenters.
<P></P>
A number of new nonweapon proficiencies are mentioned in these kits. See
Chapter 2, &quot;<A HREF="DD05777.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD05777.htm">Proficiencies</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">,&quot; for a complete listing of thief nonweapon proficiencies and complete
descriptions of those which are new.
<P></P>
It is not recommended that you use both secondary skills and nonweapon
proficiencies. We strongly recommend that you use the nonweapon proficiency rules if
you are going to use these new guidelines for thief types; they give the thieves
much more color and definition, and make for a more interesting and versatile
campaign.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Skill Progression:</I> This section of each thief kit suggests which of the traditional thieves'
skills (picking pockets, etc.) are most valuable to that sort of thief. It is
recommended that characters rise fastest in those skills, since they are the ones
that are likely to get the most practice. These are meant as suggestions?the
choice of how to allot skill improvements ought to remain in the hands of the
player.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Equipment:</I> Some thief types tend to make use of certain forms of equipment, either from
preference or need; or they may be limited in what equipment they can carry. We
will note such situations. A Beggar, for instance, can't beg very well if he's
dressed in resplendent finery, with gilded armor and bejeweled weapons.
<P></P>
These equipment listings aren't really restrictions. Rather, they reflect what
time and trial have proven to be most advantageous for a thief of this or that
variety. If the character is fulfilling his role, the equipment will make
sense; and the DM is encouraged to assist in pointing out the value of the
suggested equipment when a character experiments with other things.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Special Benefits: </I>Most thief types have some special benefits that the others don't. These may
be straightforward special abilities. Often, however, they reflect the thief's
relationship to his society; they may be defined as special reaction bonuses,
special privileges in certain cultures or regions, and so forth. A Fence, for
instance, gets better reactions from other thieves (especially if they want him as
a business partner), and also has less trouble than other characters in
finding thieves willing to hire out their skills.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Special Hindrances:</I> Similarly, each thief type has certain disadvantages which hinder him, such
as the reaction penalties of Beggars.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Races:</I> In the previous chapter we discussed nonhuman thieves in general. Each kit
was written with the human character in mind. In a sense, demihuman thieves of
each race are a kit unto themselves, because of their nonhuman heritage. However,
it is certainly possible for demihumans to take one of these kits (pending the
Dungeon Master's approval, of course). Before putting too much effort into a
non-human character, be sure to approve the race/kit mix with your DM. He might
not appreciate dwarf pirates, for instance.
<P></P>
Under the heading &quot;Races&quot;, we note in each kit special considerations for
nonhuman thieves: races recommended (or the opposite) for that kit, and any special
modifications that might apply if a nonhuman character is used.
<P></P>
<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
In the following sections, several thief kits include reaction bonuses and
penalties as part of their special benefits and special hindrances. A word of
caution needs to accompany them.
<P></P>
In the AD&amp;D? game, when a character is very charismatic, he gets what is
called a &quot;reaction adjustment.&quot; (See the <I>Player's Handbook</I>, <A HREF="PHB_DD01436.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01436.htm">p. 18</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.) When the character has a high Charisma and receives a bonus, it's expressed
as a plus; +2, for instance. When he has a low Charisma and receives a
penalty, it's expressed as a minus; -3, for example.
<P></P>
However, when you roll the 2d10 for encounter reactions (see the<I> Dungeon Master's Guide</I>, <A HREF="DMG_DD00563.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00563.htm">p. 103</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">), don't add the bonus (+) or subtract the penalty (-) from the die roll. Do
it the other way around. If the character has a Charisma of 16, and thus gets a
+5 reaction adjustment, you subtract that number from the 2d10 roll. (Otherwise
the NPCs would be reacting even more badly because the character was
charismatic!)
