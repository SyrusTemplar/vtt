</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Githyanki are a militant and xenophobic race, descended from humans, that
dwell on the Astral Plane and pay eternal homage to an undying necromancer
queen. In their strictly regimented society, organized into martial hierarchies of
command, specialized wizards—including necromancers—play an important role.
Every githyanki command structure, from the smallest platoon to the mightiest
citadel, contains at least one necromancer capable of devastating opponents on the
field or manipulating the dead to fight for the living.
<P></P>
Unlike the wizards in drow society, githyanki necromancers have a respected
rank and high status in their civilization. Githyanki wizards tend to be female
in honor of their lich-queen. Although of slightly inferior rank to an acting
captain, they are independent of the military chain of command and lend their
support in a battle where it is needed.
<P></P>
On the Prime Material Plane, githyanki necromancers are always encountered
supporting a larger war party consisting of at least 2–7 other individuals. The
party might be hunting for sport, engaging in a serious training mission (human
blasting), performing reconnaissance for an upcoming outpost or stronghold, or
seeking to recover a lost necromantic artifact (probably a silver sword capable
of severing a mortal’s silver cord in the Astral Plane). Like other members of
their race, actively serving githyanki necromancers vary in power from the 4th
to 11th levels of experience. However, once they reach the 12th level,
githyanki are brought before their paranoid and pitiless queen, who greedily devours
their life force in a solemn ritual known as “retirement.”
<P></P>
In addition to their magical and racial powers, all githyanki possess powerful
psionic abilities which vary according to class and level of ability. <A HREF="corerule-page%3dCBN00068.htm.php.html#a33082f5"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dCBN00068.htm.php.html#a33082f5">Table 6</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> presents a suggested regimen of psionic abilities for githyanki wizards. The
mental strength of such mages increases with level, starting with a base 150
Psionic Strength Points (PSPs) and increasing by 10 PSPs per level (maximum of
250 PSPs at 11th level).
