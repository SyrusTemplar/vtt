A few extra Hit Dice and an Armor Class bonus are not enough to make a legend.
This section contains suggestions for the extraordinary powers that legendary
creatures possess; feel free to create more.

Not all powers are the same. Just like a dragon’s fear radius is based on its
age, the potency of a legendary monster’s power is based upon its overall rank.
For example, the lethality of an elder’s breath weapon is noticeably different
than that of a lesser scion.
