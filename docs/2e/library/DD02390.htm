Grappled characters are physically restrained by their foes. There are a
number of ways to grapple with an opponent; wrestling, martial holds, pinning, and
grabbing are all possible. In addition, some monsters have special attacks that
grapple their victims. For example, a giant scorpion can pin its prey in its
claws, or an owlbear can hug a victim.

Grappled creatures must get free before they can move. The only combat actions
a grappled creature can take are:

<P></P>
Respond with unarmed combat.
<P></P>
Attack the grappling creature with a size S weapon.
<P></P>
Attempt to escape. Each grappling method defines a means of escape.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Grappling creatures occupy the same square on the battle map, unless there is
something unusual about the monster doing the grappling. For example, a roper
can grapple characters up to 10 squares away with its special tentacle attack.
<P></P>
Grappling figures never threaten other squares.
