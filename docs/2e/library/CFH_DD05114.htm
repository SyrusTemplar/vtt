With the Armorer proficiency, a character knows how to build all varieties of
armor. Armorer overlaps a couple of other proficiencies:
<P></P>
The Armorer knows enough Blacksmithing to forge metal armor and craft scale
and chain mail (though he cannot forge horseshoes, wrought iron gates, hardened
metal tools, or any other useful items unless he also knows Blacksmithing);
<P></P>
The Armorer knows enough Leatherworking to cut and shape boiled leather into
leather armor, shield coverings, and the under-layers of scale mail and banded
mail (though he cannot make dress jerkins, saddles, elaborate pouches or
rucksacks, or any other useful leather items). The Armorer knows enough of the
Tailor's art to manufacture padded armor and armor padding (but not enough to cut
and sew any sort of good-looking garment).
<P></P>
Naturally, the ordinary Blacksmith cannot forge metal armor, the Leatherworker
is not experienced with making leather armors, and the Tailor isn't conversant
with the making of padded armor, unless they also take the Armorer proficiency.
<P></P>
The Armorer can repair existing armor that has taken damage (if you're using
that optional rule), and can also craft barding (horse armor) through use of his
proficiency.
<P></P>
But what does all of this mean in a campaign?
