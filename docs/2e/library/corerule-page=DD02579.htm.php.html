Climbing characters lose all AC bonuses for Dexterity and shield, and may have
rear attack modifiers applied against them. They have a –2 penalty to attack,
damage, and saving throw rolls. If a character is above his enemy, he gains a
+2 bonus on his attack rolls; if he is beneath his enemy, he suffers an
additional –2 penalty.

Any time a character is struck while climbing, she must make a climbing check,
detailed in Chapter 14: Time and Movement in the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01781.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01781.htm.php.html">PHB</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">. Note: you can use a default check of 30% in good conditions.
