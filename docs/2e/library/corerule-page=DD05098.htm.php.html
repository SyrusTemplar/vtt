Druids may wish to consecrate a sacred grove, perhaps awaken it to its magical
properties. To this end, they must find a suitable natural site with the
features described earlier.
<P></P>
After preparing a site, the druid performs a ritual to sanctify it. This
ceremony, a blessing and invocation of Nature--takes a day of uninterrupted prayer.
Once sanctified, a site becomes a sacred grove--a living shrine to Nature,
where druids can perform their rites.
<P></P>
As druids worship there over the years, a sacred grove tends to absorb power
from the rituals, becoming a holier place. If druids consistently venerate a
grove, it may awaken to the magical powers described earlier. Venerating a grove
means that druids (not necessarily just the one who sanctified it) pray and
meditate there on a regular basis. Furthermore, the druid appointed the grove's
steward must faithfully tend it.
<P></P>
A sanctified sacred grove actively visited and tended for seven years has a
chance to gain magical powers. This time need not be contiguous--that is, a
sacred grove can be active for five years, then abandoned, then active for another
two years. After the seven years have passed, the DM begins rolling 1d10 each
spring. On a roll of 10, the grove &quot;awakens.&quot; Awakened groves gain the basic
powers of a lesser sacred grove and a special ability (<A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD05099.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD05099.htm.php.html">Table 3</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">).
<P></P>
Sacred groves with a long history of druidic use become the most potent, their
power slowly increasing over the ages as a result of continued exposure to
druidic magic. For every seven years an awakened grove remains active, it has a
further 10% chance of gaining additional powers, to a maximum of six powers. Roll
on Table 3 at each success, rerolling duplicated powers.
<P></P>
A lesser magical sacred grove becomes a greater grove only through millennia
of use by druids or direct divine intervention. DMs may assume a 10% chance of
gaining greater grove status (and 1d4 such powers) per thousand years of
veneration by druids.
