The <I>highway</I> spell creates a shimmering plane of force that acts as a magical conveyor for
the priest. By standing at the forward edge of the 10 x 100 yard plane, the
priest and as many followers as can fit onto the square can travel as outlined
below.
<P></P>
The <I>highway</I> travels 30 miles per hour (MV 88) over all terrains. The priest sets the
height of the <I>highway</I> in a range from 1 foot to 100 yards above ground level. The highway moves as
the priest wills; if the priest wishes to fix a destination in his mind, the <I>highway</I> will take the shortest route to that destination until the priest changes the
course in his mind.
<P></P>
The <I>highway</I> cannot be used offensively. It will automatically travel over or around
obstacles such as buildings and large creatures. It protects creatures traveling on
it from adverse effects of the elements (ice, rain, gales, etc.). The <I>highway</I> can hover in place, but hovering can be achieved only at a height of 12
inches above ground level.
<P></P>
When the spell expires or the destination is reached, the highway gently
lowers the priest and his party to the ground. The priest may order the <I>highway</I> to drop off creatures and collect others at intermediate destinations,
although the priest who cast the spell must remain on the <I>highway</I> or it will disappear.
