<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Savage</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Savages are characters from primitive societies, individuals who lived on
their own or in extended families. They differ from barbarians in that they have
no established villages or communities. They live off the land by hunting and
foraging. They do not herd animals or establish farms. Savages find their way
into adventuring groups simply by crossing paths with player character heroes.
They are quick to become a part of an adventuring family, and they are
comfortable traveling and exploring. However, savages are uncomfortable in towns, and
they are suspicious of civilized trappings.

essentially lower class.
