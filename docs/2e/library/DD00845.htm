<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Staff of the Woodlands:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This sort of staff is always made from oak, ash, or yew, finely grained,
beautifully carved, and bound with bronze. It is effective only in the hands of a
druid. Each such staff has the following powers, with each expending one charge
per use:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I> </I><B>? </B><I>Wall of thorns
<P></P>
</I><B>? </B><I>Animal friendship</I> plus <I>speak with animals
<P></P>
</I><B>? </B><I>Animate tree*</I>
<P></P>
<P></P>
* This function duplicates the ability of a treant to cause a large tree to
move at a movement rate of 3 and attack as if it were a largest-sized treant, and
in all other respects becoming a virtual treant for eight rounds per charge
expended. Note that one round is required for the tree to animate, and it will
return to rooting on the eighth, so only six of the initial eight rounds are
effectively available for the attack function.
<P></P>
<P></P>
In addition to these powers, each <I>staff of the woodlands</I> has a magical weapon value. Those with a lesser value have extra magical
powers that do not require charges and can be employed once per day: The +4 staff
has no additional powers; the +3 staff also confers the power of <I>pass without trace;</I> the +2 staff confers the powers of <I>pass without trace</I> and <I>barkskin;</I> the +1 staff confers the powers of the +2 staff plus the power of the <I>tree</I> spell. To determine which sort of staff has been discovered, assign even
chances for each of the four types.
