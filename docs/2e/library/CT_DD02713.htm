Critical hits automatically inflict double damage dice, or triple damage dice
if the weapon is two sizes larger than the target (<A HREF="DD02712.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02712.htm">see above</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.) However, any effects beyond this can be avoided by a successful saving
throw vs. death. For example, the critical roll may indicate an arm injury with
minor bleeding, but if the victim makes his saving throw, no arm injury actually
takes place. The character only suffers double damage from the hit. Obviously,
this could be sufficient to mortally wound or kill a character anyway.

Some monsters are naturally resistant to the effects of certain critical
injuries. Creatures such as golems, undead, or elementals don?t bleed and therefore
ignore any such effects. A monster like a hydra can lose a head without being
instantly slain. However, these injuries can still be important because it might
affect the way a monster moves or attacks. A skeleton that?s had a leg knocked
off can?t move at its full rate, even if it is less troubled by the injury
than a living person would be. Slimes and jellies have no parts that are more
specialized or important than the rest of the body, and are therefore immune to the
effects of most critical hits. Use common sense to handle these situations as
they arise.
