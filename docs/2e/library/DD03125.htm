<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Greed:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character with this disadvantage is compelled to seek riches by whatever
means possible. His greed will interfere with the sharing of expedition spoils,
and may cause the character to alienate powerful NPCs who would otherwise be
inclined to help.
<P></P>
Alternately, a character with this disadvantage can be described as greedy for
power. In this case, he will seek to control others by persuasion, threats,
and even force. He will seek to amass as many henchmen as possible, and he will
not hesitate to employ these agents to add to his base of power. Dwarves receive
1 extra character point when they choose this disadvantage.
