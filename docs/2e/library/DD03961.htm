The invisible stalker is a creature from the elemental plane of Air. Those
encountered on the Prime Material plane have almost always been summoned by
wizards to fulfill a specific task.
<P></P>
The true form of the invisible stalker is unknown. On the Material, Astral, or
Ethereal planes, the invisible stalker can only be perceived as a shimmering
air mass which looks much like the refraction effect caused by hot air passing
in front of cold.
<P></P>
Invisible stalkers understand the common speech of men, but can not speak it.
They can converse only in their own language, which sounds much like the
roaring and whooshing of a great wind storm.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Invisible stalkers attack by using the air itself as a weapon. It is capable
of creating a sudden, intense vortex that batters a victim for 4-16 (4d4) points
of damage. Such attacks affect a single victim on the same plane as the
invisible stalker.
<P></P>
Due to their invisibility, these creatures impose a -6 penalty on the surprise
rolls of those they choose to attack. Similarly, all opponents who are unable
to see or <I>detect invisible</I> foes are at a -2 on their attack rolls. Although they are fully <I>invisible</I> on the Prime Material plane, their outlines can be dimly perceived on the
Astral or Ethereal planes.
<P></P>
Invisible stalkers can only be killed on the elemental plane of Air. If
attacked on another plane, they automatically return to their home plane when their
total hit points are exceeded by the damage they suffered.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Little is known about the lives of these creatures on their home plane. It is
assumed that they are similar to normal air elementals when encountered there.
<P></P>
Those present on the material plane are there as the result of a conjuration
by some wizard. This magic causes the creature to serve its summoner for a time.
The conjurer retains full command of the stalker until it either fulfills its
duties or is defeated and driven back to its home plane. Once given a task, an
invisible stalker is relentless. They are faultless trackers who can detect any
trail less than a day old. If ordered to attack, they will do so with great
fury and will cease their efforts only upon their own destruction or the direct
orders of their master. Once their mission is accomplished, the creature is free
to return to its home plane.
<P></P>
The invisible stalker is, at best, an unwilling servant. It resents any task
assigned to it, although brief, uncomplicated labors may be seen as something of
a diversion and thus undertaken with little resentment. Tasks that require a
week or more of its time will drive the invisible stalker to pervert the stated
intent of the command. Such commands must be carefully worded and come from a
powerful wizard. An invisible stalker may look for a loop hole in the command as
a means of striking back at its master. For example, a simple command such as
&quot;keep me safe from all harm&quot; may result in the stalker carrying the conjurer
back to the elemental plane of air and leaving him there in a well hidden
location.
<P></P>
Each day of the invisible stalker's indenturedness there is a 1% cumulative
chance that the creature will seek a means to pervert its commands and free
itself of servitude. If no option is open, the creature must continue to serve.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Invisible stalkers are a species unwillingly transplanted to the Prime
Material plane. They are slaves whose terms of servitude dominate their brief stays.
Those who have been subjected to great hardship, assigned very difficult tasks,
or who have faced death at the hands of humanoids, tend to retain a distrust or
outright hatred of them. Those that have had an easy time during past periods
of service or who are first time arrivals on the Prime Material plane may be
easier to deal with. Such feelings may carry over to influence encounters with
humanoids traveling in the aerial plane. Anyone who has befriended an invisible
stalker in the past will find that voyages through the plane of elemental Air
are far less hazardous than they might otherwise have been.
<P></P>
Invisible stalkers only obey those who actually summon them and few wizards
can be commissioned to summon such a being on another's behalf. Some mercenary
wizards have been able to construct the necessary summons onto scrolls that are
usable by others. These sell for between 5,000 and 10,000 gp and are very
dangerous to use. Even the slightest error can cause users of such scrolls to come to
a tragic end.
