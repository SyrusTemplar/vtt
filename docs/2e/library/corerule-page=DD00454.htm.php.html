Various creatures in the AD&amp;D game possess breath weapons, the most memorable
being the roaring gout of flame spewed out by a red dragon. These weapons
normally affect a cone-shaped area. One point is the dragon's mouth, and the breath
widens as it extends outward. No attack roll is required for a breath weapon.
All characters and creatures within the area of effect must make the appropriate
saving throw and suffer the consequences of a successful breath attack.
