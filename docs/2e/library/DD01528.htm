<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character who has a specific weapon proficiency is skilled with that weapon
and familiar with its use. A character does not gain any bonuses for using a
weapon he is proficient with; the combat rules and attack chances assume that
everyone uses a weapon he is proficient with. This eliminates the need to add a
modifier to every die roll during battle.
<P></P>
When a character uses a weapon that he is not proficient with, however, he
suffers a penalty on his chance to hit. The size of this penalty depends on the
character's class. Warriors have the smallest penalty because they are assumed to
have passing familiarity with all weapons. Wizards, by comparison, are heavily
penalized because of their limited study of weapons. The modifiers for each
class (which are taken as penalties to the attack die roll) are listed on <A HREF="DD01524.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01524.htm">Table 34</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
