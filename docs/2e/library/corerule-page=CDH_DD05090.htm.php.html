<B>Cloudscape</B> (Alteration)
<P></P>
<P></P>
Sphere: Weather
<P></P>
Range: 120 yards
<P></P>
Components: V, S
<P></P>
Duration: 3 turns/level of caster
<P></P>
Casting Time: 8
<P></P>
Area of Effect: 1,000 cubic feet/level of caster
<P></P>
Saving Throw: None
<P></P>
<P></P>
A character can cast <I>cloudscape</I> on a single cloud or part of a cloud bank, usually from a nearby mountaintop
or while flying. It causes 1,000 cubic feet of cloud per level of the caster to
become solid enough to support any weight. The solidified clouds remain
airborne and feel like a thick carpet.
<P></P>
A creature that falls onto the magically strengthened cloud sustains falling
damage per the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01739.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01739.htm.php.html">PH, p. 104</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">. An animal or individual that flies into the solidified cloud falls, stunned,
for a round and must make a successful Dexterity check to recover. If a
creature is flying through a cloud at the moment it becomes solidified, it may make a
saving throw vs. petrification. Those who succeed escape the cloud in time.
Creatures that fail the save become trapped as the cloud solidifies around them.
However, as the cloud is porous, they can continue to breathe until the spell's
duration elapses.
<P></P>
The solidified cloud itself continues to drift with the wind as usual. While
the caster cannot use this particular spell to propel the cloud at all, a <I>control winds</I> spell can summon a great gust of air to turn the cloudscape into a unique
flying conveyance easily enough.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Nature's Charm </B>(Enchantment/Charm)
<P></P>
<P></P>
Sphere: Elemental (earth, water)
<P></P>
Range: Touch
<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>
Duration: 2 hours/level of caster
<P></P>
Casting Time: 1 round
<P></P>
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius/level of caster
<P></P>
Saving Throw: Creatures native to the area of effect are not affected.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Nature's charm</I> causes a particular place to exert a special fascination beyond mere beauty
to anyone entering the area except the spellcaster.
<P></P>
This spell must target a site of notable natural splendor that possesses both
edible plants and fresh water. The spot may not be larger than the spell's area
of effect. For instance, a 12th-level druid could cast this spell on a forest
glade up to 360 feet across, with flowers and fruit-bearing trees centered
around a waterfall.
<P></P>
Anyone coming upon the enchanted region must save vs. spell; those who fail
invariably make up excuses to remain there long after they should have left. They
say they want only to bathe, rest, admire the beauty a bit longer, eat the
berries or fruit, paint a picture of the area, or defend the spot jealously from
others.
<P></P>
Whatever the reason, those who fall victim to the enchantment forcefully
resist all attempts to make them leave until the spell's duration ends.
<P></P>
The spell's material component is the druid's holy symbol.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Strengthen Stone </B>(Alteration)
<P></P>
<P></P>
Sphere: Elemental (earth)
<P></P>
Range: 10 yards
<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>
Duration: Permanent
<P></P>
Casting Time: 1 hour
<P></P>
Area of Effect: 1 building or wall
<P></P>
Saving Throw: None
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Strengthen stone</I> can reinforce any stone construction (house, tower, wall segment, aqueduct,
etc.), against physical damage. The DM adds +4 to the structure's saving throw
against any kind of damage, from siege engines to natural earthquakes. The stone
object gains a saving throw vs. the <I>earthquake</I> spell. (<A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD02281.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD02281.htm.php.html">See the PH, p. 233</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">.) The spell may be cast only once on any stone object.
<P></P>
If a character casts this spell on a stone golem or other animated stone being
(like one created by animate rock), the creature receives a -1 bonus to its
Armor Class and adds a +1 bonus to its saving throws for the duration of the
spell. Strengthen stone has no effect on earth elementals or galeb duhr.
<P></P>
The material component, a diamond chip worth at least 500 gp, must be crushed
and sprinkled on the construction.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Thornwrack </B>(Alteration)
<P></P>
<P></P>
Sphere: Plant
<P></P>
Range: Touch
<P></P>
Components: V, S
<P></P>
Duration: 1 thorn/level of caster
<P></P>
Casting Time: 8
<P></P>
Area of Effect: 1 person
<P></P>
Saving Throw: Neg.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Thornwrack</I> causes long, painful thorns to grow out of the spell recipient's flesh,
piercing the skin from the inside. One thorn appears each round, inflicting 1d3
points of damage, until all the thorns have appeared. When the number of thorns
exceeds the subject's experience level or HD, a victim still conscious becomes
immobilized by the pain, unable to take any action.
<P></P>
One round after the last thorn erupts from the victim's flesh, the first one
disappears. The thorns continue receding at a rate of one per turn. Immobilized
subjects can move again once the number of thorns falls below their HD or
experience level. For instance, say the body of a 4th-level character has seven
thorns. After four turns had passed, only three thorns would remain, so the victim
would no longer be immobile.
<P></P>
<I>Cure</I> spells can restore hit points but do not eliminate the thorns.<I> Dispel magic</I> will end the spell but prevents existing thorns from receding. A <I>heal</I> spell cancels the <I>thornwrack</I>, eliminates all existing thorns, and cures all damage. Without the benefit of
magical remedies, the spell ends when the last thorn has receded.
<P></P>
