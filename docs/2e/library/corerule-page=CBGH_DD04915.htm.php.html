Despite the fact that halflings are defined by their subrace and their
character class, many players enjoy a little more distinction in their PCs. The
halfling kits present a variety of different frameworks for playing a character of
the small folk, each with its own strengths and weaknesses--but more importantly,
each with a specific niche in his or her society.
<P></P>
Kits are optional--no halfling must follow one. They can be incorporated into
characters already existing in a campaign, as long as the PC's background is
consistent with the character type of the kit. However, a character who is
assigned one kit can never exchange that kit for another.
<P></P>
The kits in this chapter are designed for halfling characters and should not
be employed with PCs of other races. It should be noted that halflings can use
many of the kits introduced in other rulebooks, including the<I> Complete Fighter's Handbook</I>, the <I>Complete Thief's Handbook</I>, the <I>Complete Priest's Handbook</I>, the<I> Complete Psionics Handbook</I>, and <I>The Complete Spacefarer's Handbook</I>. Indeed, one kit usable only by halflings, the Whistler, appears in <I>The Complete Bard's Handbook</I>.
<P></P>
Each of the four character classes available to halflings (fighter, thief,
fighter/thief, and cleric) is given several kits. A character may only take a kit
suited to his or her character class. All characters are limited to a single
kit. Halflings may become clerics of up to 8th level, fighters of up to 9th
level, thieves of up to 15th level, and fighter/thieves of up to 9th and 15th level,
respectively. At the DM's option, exceptionally talented halflings (those with
scores of 15 or above in their prime requisite) can exceed these maximums by
up to 4 additional levels.
