From the wizard's perspective, the key features of the Ethereal planes include
the following:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> The effects of time occur 10 times slower than on the Prime Material plane.
For instance, for every 10 turns that pass on the Ethereal planes, only a single
turn has passed. Therefore, the subjective time for the wizard to memorize and
cast spells is 10 times as long as the actual time required.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> The thick soup of ethereal matter restricts clear vision to about 100 yards.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> Because of the semi-solid nature of the ethereal matter, spells that create
restraining effects, such as <I>web </I>and <I>wall of stone</I>, are easily circumvented by the victim-- he must only move the ethereal
matter out of the way. Restraining spells that inflict damage, such as<I> wall of fire</I>, are equally easy to circumvent, but still cause harm to the victim.
<P></P>
<P></P>
The schools of magic are affected as follows:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Abjuration:</B> Spells of 5th level and above will not function.
<P></P>
<B>Alteration:</B> All spells of this school function normally, subject to the special laws of
the Ethereal planes.
<P></P>
<B>Conjuration/Summoning:</B> Entities from the Prime Material, Astral, and outer planes cannot be summoned.<I> Leomund's secret chest</I> places the conjured chest in a location in the Ethereal plane different from
that of the caster.
<P></P>
<B>Divination:</B> These spells function only if the wizard is in the area between the Prime
Material plane and the Ethereal planes (called the Border Ethereal) and is casting
the spells into one of the adjacent planes. For instance, <I>detect magic</I> will not work in the Ethereal plane, but it functions normally if cast from
the Border Ethereal into the Ethereal planes. <I>Contact other plane,</I> however, functions everywhere in the Ethereal planes.
<P></P>
<B>Enchantment/Charm:</B> All spells of this school function normally, subject to the special laws of
the Ethereal planes.
<P></P>
<B>Invocation/Evocation: All</B> spells of this school function normally, subject to the special laws of the
Ethereal planes, except that materials created by evocation spells are made of
ethereal matter and have the properties of that matter. <I>Bigby's forceful hand</I>, for instance, will not stop an opponent.
<P></P>
<B>Illusion/Phantasm:</B> All spells of this school function normally, subject to the special laws of
the Ethereal planes. However, illusionary images and items do not disappear at
the end of the spell's duration, or when the wizard stops concentrating, or when
the illusion is touched. Instead, the images and items gradually fade away. <I>Invisibility, change self</I>, and <I>fear</I> are not subject to fading and function normally.
<P></P>
<B>Necromancy:</B> All spells of this school function normally, subject to the special laws of
the Ethereal planes.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> <B>Magical Items:</B> Pluses on weapons are reduced by one to attack and damage rolls (a <I>sword +2</I> effectively becomes a <I>sword +1</I> ). Armor and protective devices are likewise reduced by one plus. Magical
items that duplicate specific types of spells operate under the same restrictions
as described above.
