<P></P>
This cooperative spell requires at least two priests to cast the spell
simultaneously. During the casting, the priests determine whether the line will be
stationary or portable.
<P></P>
If the spell is stationary, each priest must inscribe a magical sigil on
parallel facing surfaces, such as facing walls of a gatehouse or two tree trunks. If
the spell is portable, the priests must stand at each end of the line, thereby
anchoring it.
<P></P>
After the spell is cast, a shimmering field of force appears between the two
anchors (the sigils or priests). The field is 10 feet high and sparkles with
energy. Objects on the opposite side of the translucent field, while recognizable,
are hazy and indistinct.
<P></P>
The field causes 1d3 points of damage to all creatures passing through it;
evil creatures and undead suffer 1d8 points of damage from the field. Creatures
that roll a successful saving throw suffer no damage. Creatures that can fly over
the field, burrow under it, or <I>teleport</I> to the other side are immune to damage.
<P></P>
If the spell is cast in its portable form, the priests can move at half their
movement rates (limited to the rate of the slower priest). The priests can take
no other action, since all their energy is spent in walking and maintaining
the field.
<P></P>
Once created, the field cannot be increased or decreased in length and must
remain straight. The priests could maneuver by pivoting, but could not walk
toward each other or bend the field around a corner. If the line of sight between
the two priests is blocked by any object of greater than 5' diameter, the spell
immediately fails. Thus, creatures, low walls, young trees, pillars, and similar
objects will not disrupt the spell.
<P></P>
As a cooperative spell, several priests can link together to create a longer
field. Each priest (or sigil) forms the end of one field and the beginning of
another, much like fenceposts. Each section of the spell must extend in a
straight line, but the field can be bent at each junction. Four priests could form a
long line, a square, or a Z pattern. The restrictions on moving the fields apply
as outlined above. The DM may apply movement penalties depending on the
complexity of the pattern.
<P></P>
The material components are the priests' croziers, staves, or religious
standards, held aloft by each caster.
<P></P>
The reverse of this spell, <I>line of destruction</I>, causes 1d3 damage to all creatures passing through it. It causes 1d8 damage
to paladins and creatures of good alignment who pass through it. Creatures that
roll a successful saving throw suffer no damage.
