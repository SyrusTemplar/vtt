Sometimes, when PCs and NPCs are thick in combat, an NPC may try to calm
things down, call for the two sides to part and cease fightingâ€”at least for a while.
It may be that the NPC has figured out that the two parties should be allied,
or that he wants to bribe the PCs, or even conduct surrender negotiations . . .
from a position of strength.
<P></P>
If your characters never negotiate, once again your campaign options are
limited. You have to brute-force some sense into them. A good way to do this is to
have the PCs fight an NPC group who have a hostage or artifact crucial to the
PCs. The NPCs say they will kill the hostage or destroy the artifact if the PCs
don't stop fighting for a minute. And they're telling the truth . . .
<P></P>
Once the PCs have lost several hostages or artifacts dear to them, they may
start reconsidering their reactionary policies. And once they get in the habit of
doing a little talking with the enemy, they may figure out that they can also <I>initiate</I> such communication in future combats.
