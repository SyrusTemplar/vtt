This popular character is the halfling equivalent of the bard, a musician and
storyteller traveling about out of curiosity and a general love of life. His or
her wanderings give the character grist for the tales and legends by which he
or she earns a living. Like the Cartographer, he or she is curious about the
wide world, but it is people, not places, that draw a Traveler's attention.
Nothing makes a Traveler happier than meeting people from a wide variety of
cultures, and this enthusiasm translates into a remarkable ability to understand and
adapt to local customs.
<P></P>
A Traveler must have a Charisma score of at least 15.
<P></P>
Roads to Adventure: The Traveler is another of those rare (some would say
'mad') halflings for whom the comforts of hearth and burrow are simply not enough.
It begins almost always in childhood with the feeling that the fair in the next
village must be just a little grander than the one at home. Accomplished
Travelers can become the confidants of kings and queens, the emissaries of earls,
the entertainers of nobles and sages.
<P></P>
Role: The Traveler does much the same work as a bard but takes himself or
herself far less seriously. He or she is an accomplished wordsmith, capable of
spinning a yarn on the spur of the moment that can reduce an audience to tears or
helpless laughter. All Travelers play a musical instrument, but it will always
be a simple, homey instrument like a banjo, harmonica, or fiddle rather than one
of the more sophisticated instruments favored by bards. Travelers are also
fond of entertaining children with simple sleight-of-hand tricks, and one will
often put on a special show just for children when he or she comes to town.
<P></P>
A Traveler's performances are almost always informal, homespun
affairs--swapping stories and sharing a jug with the old folks around a hearthfire, playing
the fiddler and being the caller for courting couples at the local hoedown and
square dance, thrilling youngsters with monster stories enlivened by special
sound effects. Travelers are masters of the Question Game and enjoy matching their
skill against that of the local champs. Because of their genuine enjoyment of
people, Travelers are quick to make friends. As a rule, they are welcomed nearly
everywhere they go and remembered fondly when they depart.
<P></P>
Secondary Skills: Most Travelers will avoid secondary skills on principle.
<P></P>
Weapon Proficiencies: The Traveler can use any weapon; usually he or she will
try to select something unique. Travelers are particularly fond of weapons that
don't look like weapons--for example, a walking stick which is actually a
swordstick, or wooden juggling balls that can be used as missile weapons.
<P></P>
Bonus Nonweapon Proficiencies: The Traveler receives Musical Instrument as a
bonus proficiency.
<P></P>
Recommended Nonweapon Proficiencies: Dance, Disguise, Etiquette, Juggling,
Tumbling, and Ventriloquism are all useful proficiencies for a Traveler.
<P></P>
Thieving Skill Emphasis: Travelers do very little actual stealing, as a rule,
but the Pick Pockets skill comes in handy in their sleight-of-hand shows.
<P></P>
Equipment: Aside from his or her musical instrument, weapons, and the clothes
he or she wears, a Traveler will have few possessions, no more than he or she
can easily carry. Gold has a tendency to tie a body down, in his or her opinion,
and the character is likely to leave any excess wealth that comes his or her
way on the door of some worthy widow or orphan as he or she leaves town, light
of heart and empty of pocket.
<P></P>
Special Benefits: The Traveler has several bard-like abilities: he or she
receives a +2 to all Reaction Rolls due to the character's innate goodwill to all
and friendly demeanor. A Traveler who has time to tell friends and allies an
inspiring story before they enter a combat gives them the same attack and saving
throw bonuses as a <I>bless</I> spell. Finally, his or her music offers immunity to song-based <I>charm</I> attacks (for example, a harpy's singing) to all within earshot, but only so
long as the Traveler can keep playing non-stop.
<P></P>
Special Hindrances: As noted above, all Travelers are poor, by choice. It has
been said that a Traveler has a million friends and no home, and this is true;
while his or her folksy manner and homespun ways win the character a welcome
everywhere he or she goes, he or she has no family or burrow to return to.
Travelers are essentially sociable loners who dread the day when old age will force
them to stop their wandering at last.
