</B>Don-t Force the Action</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
Consider contingencies that can preserve your plot. Treat your adventure as a
story with an unwritten ending, and be willing to let your players write it. If
you have over-planned, you must fight the desire to lead your players around
by the nose.
<P></P>
This doesn-t mean that high-level characters are the deciding force on your
campaign world for every event, but they probably have the power to shape events
around them. A high-level nemesis can aid in pushing the PCs in the direction
you want them to go, but it-s doubtful the villain is so ingenious that he never
gets foiled. After all, if the heroes of the land cannot successfully oppose
the villain, who can?
<P></P>
A common justification for forcing the action is designing plots that turn on
single events, such as the actions of a single villain: -But if the Count
doesn-t get away, he won-t be around to set fire to the bridge in the final
encounter.-
<P></P>
High-level player characters have a way of upsetting well-laid plans, so build
plots that can stand up to PC tinkering. If something doesn-t go the way you
planned, have a backup plan. In most cases, the player characters should find it
easier to complete the adventure if they cause a break in the plot, but not
always.
<P></P>
For example, suppose a particular NPC is supposed to escape the PCs? clutches
and then travel to a distant city where the villain is highly respected. When
the player characters arrive at the city, they are framed for a crime and earn
the local ruler-s wrath.
<P></P>
The plans begin to unravel when the player characters capture the villain with
a <I>rope of entanglement</I>, an item the DM forgot the party had. Rather than concocting some feeble
reason why the villain escapes, a thoughtful DM puts a backup plan into effect.
<P></P>
When the player characters interrogate their prisoner, the villain lies-of
course-about what is really going. The player characters easily discover the lie,
but they also uncover the villain-s travel plans. The heroes might travel to
the city, hoping to discover what the blackguard was up to. The villain-s agents
might frame the player characters anyway, but the heroes, having sifted a few
essential facts from the villain-s lies, are slightly better off than they
otherwise would have been.
<P></P>
The DM might put a similar backup plan into play if the player characters slay
the villain. Perhaps the villain-s agents convince their ruler that the heroes
are bandits, spies, or assassins. When the PCs arrive, they become embroiled
in a diplomatic crisis.
