<A NAME="19fbe61c"></A><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Proficiencies and the Point System</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The point system lets players give their characters a wider variety of
skills and abilities than are available with the standard rules. However, skills
that are not related to a character?s class are still more difficult and expensive
to obtain than those tied directly to the adventurer?s area of expertise.
<P></P>
Character points help determine an adventurer?s initial proficiencies. Players
can also assign character points earned during play to improve their heroes?
chances of success with proficiencies, as well as to add new proficiencies.
<P></P>
Unlike the original proficiency rules, the <I>Skills and Powers</I> system gives each proficiency a rating?a possibility for success. This is
influenced by a character?s ability score (see <A HREF="DD03010.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03010.htm">Table 44</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">: Ability Modifiers to Proficiency Scores). It is a more realistic approach,
since proficiencies can be gradually improved. In these rules there is a
significant difference in performance between someone with a beginning level of
proficiency and someone who is an expert.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
In this step of the character creation process, all player characters receive
an additional allotment of character points, based on their classes, to
purchase their initial non-weapon proficiencies. In addition, any leftover points from
race or class ability selection in the previous chapters can be used here.
Finally, characters may add their CP bonuses for their Intelligence scores to
their total of character points at this time. The number of CPs awarded to each
type of character in this step appears in the table below.
<P></P>
Characters may also choose <A HREF="DD03008.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03008.htm">disadvantages</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> at this point, which can give them bonus CPs to spend in acquiring extra
skills or traits.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> When a character is created or converted from the standard AD&amp;D game rules to
the <I>Skills and Powers</I> system, character points must be expended for each proficiency selected. The
more points spent, the better the character will be at using that particular
proficiency.
<P></P>
<A HREF="DD03011.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03011.htm">Table 45</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">: Nonweapon Proficiency Groups lists the proficiencies available. It is broken
into five categories?general proficiencies, and those relating to the priest,
rogue, wizard, and warrior classes. Players can choose proficiencies from any
of the lists, though the costs for some will be increased because they don?t
relate to a character?s class.
<P></P>
Additionally, some characters, because of high Intelligence scores, can add
bonus proficiencies at the time of character creation.
<P></P>

<A NAME="018b35bd"></A><A NAME="018b35bd"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Character Point Costs
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character point cost is indicated for each specific entry?that is the
expenditure in points required for players to add that skill to their characters?
repertoires. The cost is normal if the proficiency is selected from the general
list or the list relating to a character?s class. If it is selected from a
different character class list, the initial cost for the proficiency is increased by
2.
<P></P>
For example, Wingo the thief decides to spend character points on an
assortment of proficiencies, including fishing (for a cost of 3) from the general group,
disguise (for a cost of 4) from the rogue group, and cryptography (listed cost
3) from the wizard?s group. His cost in points is as stated for the general
and rogue proficiencies, but he must pay 5 character points, not 3, to acquire
the skill from the wizard group.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="61e0fa98"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Relevant Abilities
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Each proficiency on <A HREF="DD03011.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03011.htm">Table 45</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> is listed with one or two of the character abilities and/or subabilities that
are most essential for the use of this skill. To acquire the proficiency at
the normal cost, the character must have a score of at least 9 in each of the
relevant abilities.
<P></P>
A character with lower ability scores is still allowed to purchase the skill.
However, the cost in character points is increased. Add 1 to the cost for each
point needed to bring the relevant abilities up to a 9.
<P></P>
For example, Wingo wants to become proficient at riding horses. His 15
Dexterity score is no problem, but his 7 Wisdom score gives him some difficulties.
Since the normal cost for the riding proficiency is 2 character points, and Wingo
would need to add 2 more points to raise his Wisdom to 9, he must pay 4 points
for the riding proficiency. The additional cost does not actually improve
Wingo?s Wisdom score, it merely allows him to gain the riding proficiency.
<P></P>

<A NAME="ecc8803b"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Campaign Considerations/Training
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The DM is encouraged to provide a rationale for acquiring proficiencies.
Certain skills might not be available because they relate to vocations not employed
by the cultures of the campaign environment. Riding and blacksmithing, for
example, would be unavailable in a setting based on the pre-Columbian Aztecs, while
seamanship might be unknown to a mountain-dwelling people or a character born
into a tribe of desert nomads. Of course, the DM need only introduce a traveler
from a different culture to teach or otherwise introduce a new skill to the
setting.
<P></P>
In other cases, the DM could disallow certain proficiencies at the time
characters are generated. Adding proficiencies later is simply a matter of the
players finding ways for their characters to learn the new skills?the mountain herder
who signs on as a deckhand for an ocean-crossing vessel will have plenty of
opportunities to learn seamanship.
<P></P>
An NPC who possesses a proficiency generally will have enough knowledge to
impart a basic level of skill to an nonproficient character. The amount of time
this requires varies, but it should be a matter of at least several weeks of
intensive training, or a much longer time of general exposure and experience.
<P></P>
In general, a teacher cannot raise a student?s skill to a higher level than
his own, but here, too, are exceptions. Characters who receive proficiency
bonuses for high ability scores do not have to consider these bonuses when comparing
their levels to their teacher?s.
<P></P>

<A NAME="9350ffc9"></A><A NAME="9350ffc9"></A><A NAME="9350ffc9"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Bonus Proficiencies
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Characters with average to high Intelligence scores can gain bonus nonweapon
proficiencies. The ?# of languages? rating for a character, found in the AD&amp;D
game rules, is treated as bonus character points. Bonus character points from
Intelligence cannot be spent earlier in the character creation process.
<P></P>
These points can be used only to acquire languages or acquire or improve
nonweapon proficiencies which use the Intelligence score as one of the proficiency?s
relevant abilities. However, there is one exception?warriors can use these
bonus character points as described here, or they can use them to purchase or
improve weapon proficiencies.
<P></P>
For example, Wingo the thief has an Intelligence score of 15, while Bluto the
warrior has an Intelligence score of 12. <A HREF="PHB_DD01432.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01432.htm">Table 4</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> (in the PHB) shows that Wingo is allowed to learn four languages, while Bluto
is limited to three. Wingo thus gains 4 character points that must be used for
Intelligence-based nonweapon proficiencies. He could purchase ventriloquism
(from the rogue group) or cooking (from the general group), since each of these
uses Intelligence as a relevant ability.
<P></P>
Bluto, on the other hand, could use his 3 bonus character points to purchase
cooking, or add them to his normal character points to purchase the armorer
proficiency (from the warrior group). Alternately, Bluto could use his bonus
character points to purchase or improve an additional weapon proficiency.
