When a person comes in contact with some contamination (a taboo substance), he
must be purified. In some cultures, whenever a person has killed another
honorably, though he is not considered to have sinned, he must be purified of the
killing. This ceremony involves a ritual bathing or washing of the hands (or
other contaminated part) under the supervision of a priest, who invokes the god's
blessing during the washing.
