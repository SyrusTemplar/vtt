In some cultures, the secular (non-priestly) authorities cannot put priests on
trial for any sort of crime. That doesn't mean a priest can perform a crime
and laugh at the law, however: Most priestly orders police themselves, and will
try (or punish without trial) transgressions.
<P></P>
Priestly orders don't ordinarily flaunt this power in order to defy secular
authorities. When priests commit crimes, priesthoods usually punish them.
Exceptions occur when the priest was acting at the priesthood's behest, particularly
when the god requires actions which are against the law of the land. In these
cases, the priest sometimes goes unpunished; sometimes he receives a &quot;slap on the
wrist&quot; punishment to quiet the secular authorities.

The DM, not the player, gets to decide whether priests have the right to
church trial.
