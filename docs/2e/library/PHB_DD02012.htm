When this spell is cast, the wizard causes a vertical iron wall to spring into
being. This wall can be used to seal off a passage or close a breach, for the
wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is
sufficient to do so. The wall of iron is ?-inch thick per level of experience of
the spellcaster. The wizard is able to create an iron wall of up to 15 square
feet per experience level; thus, a 12th-level wizard can create a wall of iron
with an area of 180 square feet. The wizard can double the wall's area by halving
its thickness.
<P></P>
If the caster desires, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat
surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush any creature beneath
it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction. This chance can be
modified by a force of not less than 30 Strength and 400 pounds mass--each pound
over 400 or Strength point over 30 alters the chance by 1% in favor of the
stronger side. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making
successful saving throws vs. death. Those who fail are killed. Huge and gargantuan
creatures cannot be crushed by the wall.
<P></P>
The wall is permanent, unless successfully dispelled, but it is subject to all
forces a normal iron wall is subject to--rust, perforation, etc.
<P></P>
The material component of this spell is a small piece of sheet iron.
