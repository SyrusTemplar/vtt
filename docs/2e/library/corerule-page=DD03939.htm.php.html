Powerfully-built humanoids clad only in dark, filthy rags, these warlike
subterranean creatures emerge from their deep caverns at night to search for unlucky
humans to add to their larders.
<P></P>
Grimlocks have thick, scaly, grey skin and long, black, filthy hair. Their
teeth are white and extremely sharp. Their eyes are blank white orbs.
<P></P>
Grimlocks are totally blind, but have highly developed senses of smell and
hearing. Their sensitive ears and noses combine to allow them to distinguish
objects and creatures within 20', just as well as if they were able to see.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Grimlocks are immune to the effects of spells which affect the vision. These
include <I>phantasmal force, darkness, invisibility, mirror image</I>, and many others. However, spells such as <I>audible glamer</I>, or any loud, continuous noise will partially &quot;blind&quot; them. This reduces
their ability to perceive opponents to a 10' range and makes them -2 on their
attack rolls. Substances such as snuff or strong perfumes will have much the same
effect if inhaled by a grimlock or thrown in its face.
<P></P>
Grimlocks attack fiercely, but with little or no organization, often stopping
in the middle of battle to carry off fallen foes or comrades for food. For
every 10 grimlocks encountered, there will be a leader of 3 Hit Dice and AC 4, for
every 40 there will be a champion of 4 Hit Dice and AC 3. These exceptional
individuals will usually be the only ones to show even the most elemental
strategy, usually by allowing their followers to weaken opponents before entering
battle themselves.
<P></P>
Grimlocks will nearly always attack in darkness if possible. While not
adversely affected by light, they are intelligent enough to realize that in total
darkness, their unique form of perception gives them a distinct advantage.
<P></P>
Though able to attack with their hands (for 1-6 hp damage), grimlocks prefer
edged weapons and will usually (90% chance) be armed as follows: hand-axe, 20%;
battle-axe, 15%; two-handed sword, 15%; bastard sword, 15%; broad sword, 15%;
long sword, 20%.
<P></P>
Leaders or champions will always be armed with a battle-axe or two-handed
sword.
<P></P>
Grimlocks, whether normal, leader, or champion, make all saving throws as
6th-level fighters. Grimlocks gain a +1 on surprise rolls, since their acute
hearing allows them to communicate in voices too faint for other races to hear. In
addition, their morale is raised by 1 for every leader or champion with the group.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Grimlocks lair in vast cavern complexes in mountainous areas. They are well
adapted to these environs. In any rocky terrain they blend in so well that, while
motionless, they are completely undetectable -- unless one actually bumps into
them. In any grimlock lair, there will be nearly as many females (1 Hit Die
and AC 6) as males, and at least as many young (1 hit point, AC 6 and
non-combatant). Grimlock leaders and champions do wield some control over these
communities. However, this control is usually effective only as long as the leader who
gave the order is around to enforce his will. It is nearly impossible for those
of other races to tell one grimlock from another -- although leader types may
appear slightly larger -- but they easily tell each other apart by subtle
differences in scent and movement.
<P></P>
Extremely xenophobic, grimlocks rarely consort with other races. However,
there is a small (10%) chance that they will allow <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03995.htm.php.html#89810e6e"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03995.htm.php.html#89810e6e">medusae</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> to share their lairs, and a 2% chance that any wandering group will be

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Grimlocks will only eat the raw flesh of humanoid creatures, vastly preferring
that of humans to all others. Foraging parties often raid the homes of other
subterranean races, especially those who keep large slave populations (such as
drow). They are often on good terms with mind flayers since illithids have a
large supply of humanoid bodies discarded after they have devoured the brains.
Grimlocks are particularly hated by githyanki for this reason. Since the slave
flesh the grimlocks often consume (raw) is frequently unwholesome, whole
communities are often decimated by disease.
