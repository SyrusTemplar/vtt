To make a saving throw, a player rolls 1d20. The result must be equal to or
greater than the character's saving throw number. The number a character needs to
roll varies depending upon his group, his level, and what he is trying to save
himself from. A character's saving throw numbers can be found in <A HREF="DD00458.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00458.htm">Table 46</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> . Multi-class characters use the most advantageous saving roll.
<P></P>
Saving throws are made in a variety of situations: For attacks involving
paralyzation, poison, or death magic; rod, staff, or wand; petrification or
polymorph; breath weapon; and spells. The type of saving throw a character must roll is
determined by the specific spell, monster, magical item, or situation involved.
<P></P>
Monsters also use <A HREF="DD00458.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00458.htm">Table 46</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> . However, they do not find their saving throw numbers by group and level,
since they have neither. All creatures save against poison and death magic at a
level equal to the number of their Hit Dice. Intelligent monsters save versus
all other attacks at this level as well.
<P></P>
Creatures with no intelligence (even less than animal intelligence) save at a
level equal to half the number of their Hit Dice. Any additions to their Hit
Dice are counted as well, at the rate of one die for every four points or
fraction thereof. Thus, an intelligent creature with 5 + 6 Hit Dice would save at 7th
level (5 Hit Dice + another die for the 2 remaining). A non-intelligent beast
of the same Hit Dice would save against all but poison and death at 4th level
(round up).
<P></P>
Most monsters use the Warrior group table to determine their save. However,
those that have abilities of other classes use the most favorable saving throw. A
creature able to fight and use a large number of spells could use either the
Warrior or Wizard groups, whichever was better for a particular saving throw.
Creatures that lack fighting ability use the group that most closely resembles
their own abilities. A fungus-creature that can only cast spells would use the
Wizard group table to determine saving throws.
