This nonweapon proficiency covers knowledge of a variety of methods of
divination—all of them fake. The thief with Fortune Telling is familiar with numerous
devices and methods, such as tarot cards, palm reading, interpreting the flight
of sparrows or the arrangement of a sacrificed animal's entrails, and so
forth—or at least the thief is familiar enough with these practices to make it
appear that he's an authentic soothsayer. (If fortune telling can make accurate
predictions in the DM's campaign, this proficiency does not necessarily enable the
thief to do so; it confers no magical powers.) The thief makes up the
prediction he wishes to tell.
<P></P>
A successful proficiency check indicates that the thief's customer or client
believes the fortune he was told to be authentic. If the check fails, the sham
is discovered in some way, or the prediction is simply not believed. If the DM
wishes, the same modifiers described for fast-talking (above) may be used, based
on the Intelligence and Wisdom of the subject and the believability of the
fortune predicted.
<P></P>
<I>Optional Rule:</I> If a natural 1 (or another number secretly chosen by the Dungeon Master
before the die is rolled) comes up, the event that the thief predicted actually
comes true!
