</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Charm: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The spell causes a target creature with an Intelligence rating to abandon its
own thoughts and feelings and adopt a specified emotional response toward the
caster. The caster might inspire fear, love, loyalty, friendship, or any other
purely emotional state. The emotional state remains for the duration of the
spell; however, creatures are periodically allowed new saving throws based on their
Intelligence scores as noted in the <I>charm person </I>spell.
<P></P>
If communication between the caster and the charmed creature is possible, the
caster can exercise limited control over the subject. Charmed creatures that
are asked to perform obviously suicidal actions are typically freed from a charm,
see the <I>charm person </I>spell for details.
<P></P>
Casting this spell on an undead creature triples the difficulty (60). Golems,
automatons, and animated objects cannot be charmed.

</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Compel: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The spell forces the target creature to take an immediate action of the
caster?s choosing. The action must be something the target could normally do, and the
action must not be suicidal.
<P></P>
At base difficulty, a compulsion lasts a single round. If the action requires
more time, the duration must be extended appropriately, with a corresponding
increase in difficulty.

</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Imbue: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The spell grants the target a quality or ability?other than movement?that it
did not have before. An imbued ability cannot change the target?s basic nature.
<P></P>
At base difficulty (45), the target can be imbued with a common,
non-offensive, ability that does not extend beyond the target?s touch. An animal can be
taught a simple trick, an unskilled person can be given a general proficiency, or
an object can be given a simple, physical quality it does not normally possess,
such as a bit of cloth becoming abrasive.
<P></P>
At double difficulty (90), the target can be given unusual abilities that do
not extend more than 30 feet from the object and are nonmagical in nature.
Characters can be granted proficiencies outside the general category or racial
abilities such as infravision. Similarly, a sword can be given the ability to harm
creatures normally harmed only by magical weapons or the ability to float in
water.
<P></P>
Targets can be imbued with magical abilities or extraordinary properties, but
the spellcaster must combine the spell with another type of magic. For example,
giving a sword a true magical bonus requires a strike spell (one multiple of
difficulty per plus).
<P></P>
Transmuting lead into a more valuable metal requires a transform spell at a
difficulty of 105. In addition, the extent of the transmutation increases the
imbue difficulty one multiple. At base difficulty (45+105), lead can be transmuted
into copper. Transmuting lead into silver doubles the imbue difficulty (90),
and transmuting lead into gold triples the imbue difficulty (135). If the
original material was nonmetallic, the imbue spell requires an extra multiple of
difficulty?turning wood into gold has a difficulty of 285.
<P></P>
Granting a creature the ability to <I>detect magic </I>by touch requires a reveal spell at base difficulty (20). Granting the same
creature the ability to inspire fear on sight requires a charm spell at an
adjusted difficulty of 60 (base 20 + 40 for a line-of-sight effect).
<P></P>
Imbue can also be used to create an effect that lasts until triggered. The
caster begins by creating the imbue spell with a permanent duration (this does not
cause a loss of Constitution) and then follows immediately with the effect to
be triggered. If more than a day passes between the completion of the imbue
spell and the effect, the second spell must be combined with another imbue spell.
Such effects can be combined to produce an effect that can be triggered
multiple times.
