The mysterious client is usually an NPC. He or she can be a player character,
however, if that player is briefed by the DM privately beforehand.
<P></P>
However the client is played, the role is that of a person (or perhaps a
deity) who contacts the main group of PCs and asks them to perform some task worthy
of their thiefly abilities.
<P></P>
This storyline is easy to start because the client can always direct the PCs
toward the first encounter. The most important feature here is for the DM to
surround the client with an air of mystery. Perhaps the characters never see the
client's face, or learn his or her name. Maybe all of their communications are
in writing, and they are allowed no information as to where the client can be
found.
<P></P>
Mysterious clients can be drawn from any and all character classes, or even
from the ranks of monsters. A powerful and intelligent monster that cannot mingle
freely with humans might seek thieves to perform some of its business. In the
ultimate extreme, of course, the client turns out to be a powerful god or other
extraplanar being, and the PCs are involved in really big time trouble before
they know what's happening.
<P></P>
The task required of the thieves by the client can include theft, of course.
Other possibilities include the search for a lost object, often requiring
investigative work as well as stealth; the gaining of information by requiring the
characters to serve as spies or scouts; or other even more nefarious tasks
invented by the client or the DM.
