You may be asking yourself, &quot;Figuring out what a useless arm is all about is
pretty easy; but what do they mean when your head is useless?&quot;
<P></P>
Avoiding the normal wisecracks that would result from such a straight line,
let's talk about the actual effects of this &quot;uselessness&quot; for each of the hit
locations.
<P></P>
<B>Torso:</B> The torso doesn't become useless; the &quot;Numbed&quot; and &quot;Useless&quot; numbers have no
bearing on it.
<P></P>
<B>Head:</B> When a character takes a Numbed or Useless result to his head, one of the
following effects can take place. The DM, not the player, chooses which one. He
can random-roll on 1d6, or just choose the one that he fancies most.
<P></P>
<I>(1) Blindness:</I> The character is blinded (from the pain, not injury to his eyes) until the
Numbness or Uselessness ends. When a character is blind but still trying to
defend himself, anyone attacking him gets a bonus of +4 to attack rolls. (If, for
some reason, he is also kneeling, sitting or flat on his back, the bonuses to
attack rolls are cumulative).
<P></P>
<I>(2) Deafness:</I> The character hears ringing in his ears until the Numbness or Uselessness
ends. The character suffers no combat penalty, but cannot hear orders or warnings
shouted at him.
<P></P>
<I>(3) Dizziness:</I> The character is concussed and dizzy. He performs any Dexterity ability rolls
with a penalty of â€“4 until the Numbness or Uselessness ends. Anytime he is hit
in combat for more than 2 points of damage, he must make a Dexterity ability
check to avoid falling down.
<P></P>
<I>(4) Knockdown:</I> The character is knocked flat on his backside by the blow, but does not
suffer any additional ill effect. His head is not really Numbed or Useless; as soon
as he stands up again, the disadvantage for the Knockdown goes away.
<P></P>
(5) Blindness <I>and </I>Deafness.
<P></P>
(6) Dizziness<I> and</I> Knockdown.
<P></P>
<B>Arms (2):</B> A Numbed or Useless arm cannot hold a weapon; the character immediately drops
the weapon. The character will not drop a shield strapped to the arm, but does
not get the AC benefit of the shield until his arm recovers.
<P></P>
<B>Legs (2):</B> When a character's leg is Numbed or Useless, he must immediately make a 1d20
roll against his Dexterity. If he rolls his Dexterity or less, he remains
standing (on one foot); otherwise, he flops to the ground (and is considered sitting
for purposes of striking at him). His movement drops to a fourth of what it
should be until he recovers. Every time he is hit for more than 2 points of
damage, he has to make that same 1d20 roll against Dexterity, and will fall down if
he fails it. A Shield-Rush attack will <I>automatically</I> knock this character to the ground.
<P></P>
<B>Stun-Points:</B> When a character has taken a &quot;Numbed&quot; or &quot;Useless&quot; attack result to a
stun-point, he has the wind knocked out of him and has a hard time defending himself.
His movement drops to half of what it should be until he recovers; and his
attackers are at a +2 to attack rolls him until he recovers. (This bonus <I>is</I> cumulative with other attacker bonuses for blindness or bad position.)
