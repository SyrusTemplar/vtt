<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Double-jointed:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The character has a unique ability to wriggle out of ropes, manacles,
brackets, chains, and other bonds. The bound character can make a Dexterity/Agility
check when attempting to twist free of the bonds. Such an escape requires 1d6
rounds for each limb that is bound. If the character is secured by metal brackets
or chains, the check is made at 1_2 (rounded up) of the Agility score.
Halflings add a +1 bonus to their modified Agility score when using this proficiency.
