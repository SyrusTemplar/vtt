Terrain, or the nature of the ground, has little effect on short-term
movement. A character running pell-mell across a meadow can do about the same speed in
the desert, or on a sandy beach. Only the most extreme terrain hinders short
term movement.
<P></P>
These extreme conditions are listed given on <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD00634.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD00634.htm.php.html">Table 73</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> as reductions of movement rate. The reduction applies to all movement for a
single round. When a character is in two different types of terrain during the
same round, use the worst (i.e., most difficult) adjustment.
