Physical Requirements</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Once the wizard has decided where he wants to locate his laboratory, he must
buy, build, or rent an appropriate building or room. The space should be
well-ventilated and well-lit, although the wizard can do without these comforts if he
wishes. The room must be dry and sound; dampness can destroy libraries or cause
important reagents to lose their potency. In addition, the laboratory requires
at least 400 square feet (a 20-foot by 20-foot room or equivalent floor space)
for the furnishings and work spaces.
<P></P>
In urban or civilized regions, the wizard may be able to set up his laboratory
inside another building-for example, the castle of his patron noble, a
university or library, the local wizards? guildhall, or an inn operated by a fellow
adventurer. Generally, the rent on the room should be 30 to 100 gp or (1d8+2) x
10 per month, depending on the exact circumstances of the arrangement. Renting a
shabby room in the thieves? quarter is far less expensive than paying the dues
of a guildhall or university membership. A player character may be able to
avoid paying rent altogether if a friend or patron puts him up.
<P></P>
If the wizard doesn-t want to borrow or lease a room from a landlord, he can
buy a suitable building. Again, the place should have at least 400 square feet
of floor space, or somewhat more than that if the wizard intends to live there
as well as maintain a laboratory. (A two-story building of about 20 feet x 20
feet would do nicely.) Or, he can choose to build a new building instead of
buying an old one. The table below lists construction times and costs for new
buildings; buying an existing structure costs anywhere from 50% to 100% or (1d6+4) x
10% of the listed figure.
<P></P>
<B>Stone</B> buildings are sturdier and more durable than wooden buildings, but still
feature wooden supports, flooring, and other features. Some interior partitions or
walls may be made of wood instead of stone.
<P></P>
<B>Wooden </B>buildings are much easier to build than stone buildings. The disadvantage lies
in resistance to siege attacks or other forms of damage; wooden buildings can
be destroyed easily by many spells or heavy weapons.
<P></P>
Building size is a rough description of the building's dimensions. This fits
the building types described in DMGR 2, <I>The Castle Guide</I>.
<P></P>
<B>Time</B> is the number of weeks required for construction, assuming a working crew of
10 laborers with good supervision. Obviously, this only applies in the event
the wizard wants to have someone build him a new laboratory. If the wizard wants
to save money, he can hire fewer workers, doubling the construction time for a
savings of 25% off the basic cost. On the other hand, if he's in a hurry he can
raise the building in 75% the usual time by hiring more workers, doubling the
cost.
<P></P>
<B>Cost </B>is the amount of gold pieces required to have the building raised. This
includes permits, bribes, pay for workers, expendable supplies, and all other
expenses incurred. If the wizard is buying an existing structure, he need only pay
(1d6+4) x 10% or 50%?100% of this price, depending on the building's condition,
the circumstances of the sale, and other factors.
<P></P>
<B>Area </B>is the square footage of the completed structure. A small building suffices
for the wizard's laboratory, but if the character wants to live in the same
building, it must be at least medium-sized.
