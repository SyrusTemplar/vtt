All of the above maneuvers and approaches can be used in any <I>AD&amp;D?</I> game campaign. There are a couple of things you should realize about them.
<P></P>
First, they'll add a lot of richness of detail to your combat. Using them, you
can do just about everything in combat that you can imagine your character
doing. However, the flip-side of that benefit is that it adds a level of
complexity to your combat; the players and DM have to do more thinking about individual
maneuvers and combat situations. Therefore, we don't recommend you use these
maneuvers until you already have a firm grasp on the combat system, and can run
basic combats with little or no difficulty.
<P></P>
Second, they'll allow the player-characters to be more colorful and efficient
in combat. But the flip-side of this benefit is that the NPCs and monsters can
be equally colorful and efficient. It will be a rude awakening for the
player-characters when they run across a band of evil fighters as diverse and
accomplished as they are.
