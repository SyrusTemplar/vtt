There is no guild organization to speak of, although there may be the remnants
of a once-strong guild or perhaps a young, slowly developing guild. However,
the large majority of thieves work as unregulated individuals. This may lead to
a dog-eat-dog outlook with lots of backstabbing, both metaphorical and literal.
However, it's equally possible that thieves get by with individual one-to-one
agreements, helping each other out as and when the need arises (this may be
especially likely in a Chaotic Good society with an anarchic guild, for example).
Anarchy doesn't preclude enlightened self-interest and cooperation; it just
tends to preclude this happening on a systematic and organized basis.
