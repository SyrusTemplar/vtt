When this spell is cast, it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at
a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has three major
effects:
<P></P>
First, all attacks made by evil (or evilly enchanted) creatures against the
protected creature suffer -2 penalties to attack rolls; any saving throws caused
by such attacks are made with +2 bonuses.
<P></P>
Second, any attempt to possess (as by a <I>magic jar</I> attack) or to exercise mental control over (as by a vampire's <I>charm</I> ability) the protected creature is blocked by this spell. Note that the
protection does not prevent a vampire's <I>charm</I> itself, but it does prevent the exercise of mental control through the
barrier. Likewise, a possessing life force is merely kept out. It would not be
expelled if in place before the protection is cast.
<P></P>
Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by creatures of an extraplanar or
conjured nature (such as aerial servants, elementals, imps, invisible stalkers,
salamanders, water weirds, xorn, and others). This causes the natural (body)
weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil, if such
attacks require touching the protected being. Animals or monsters summoned or
conjured by spells or similar magic are likewise hedged from the character.
<P></P>
This protection ends if the protected character makes a melee attack against
or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.
<P></P>
To complete this spell, the wizard must trace a 3-foot-diameter circle on the
floor (or ground) with powdered silver.
<P></P>
This spell can be reversed to become <I>protection from good</I>; the second and third benefits remain unchanged. The material component for
the reverse is a circle of powdered iron.
