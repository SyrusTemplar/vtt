<P></P>
With the DM-s approval, a character can abandon his or her profession and
follow a different path to power. Divine ascension requires a great deal of
attention and creativity from both DM and player. Only the barest guidelines are given
here, because each character and campaign are unique.
<P></P>
A character can seek to ascend anytime after reaching 20th level (or earlier
if the DM allows it). Once a character has reached 30th level, this is the only
option that allows the character any further advancement.
<P></P>
Once the character embarks on the path to godhood, he can never turn back. The
character ceases advancing in the original class. The character retains all
class abilities but gives up normal adventuring and acts with a new purpose.
<P></P>
The character must seek a divine sponsor-usually a deity appropriate to the
character-s alignment, original class, and race-and prepare a special offering
for that deity. The gift can be anything the character desires and the DM agrees
to. The donation need not be a single item. In any case, the gift-s monetary
value must be at least equal to the character-s experience point total.
<P></P>
While preparing the offering, the character receives experience points
normally. For each 500,000 experience points gained, the character can lower one
saving throw number one point, to a minimum saving throw of three.
<P></P>
The ability to reduce saving throw numbers below the normal minimum for the
character-s original class is special, and it is why the character must give up
his or her original class. The character gains no other benefits from
accumulated experience; no hit points, proficiencies, skills, etc.
<P></P>
When the offering is completed, the character must journey to the deity-s
abode and present the gift. If the character has been true to the principles of his
or her alignment and profession, the deity probably accepts the gift. If in
doubt, use Table 59, Encounter Reactions, from the <A HREF="DMG_DD00564.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00564.htm">Dungeon Master Guide</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. If the deity-s alignment and portfolio match the character-s alignment and
profession-for example, a lawful good fighter petitioning a lawful good war
deity-use the first column on the table. If the character and deity are slightly
mismatched, use the second column. Otherwise, use the third column. If the
reaction roll is friendly, the deity accepts the gift. If not, the deity destroys the
gift and sends the character away. The character can try again with the same
deity or with another deity.
<P></P>
Note that the character might not get an immediate audience with the deity.
Just finding and entering the deity-s abode could be an adventure in itself. The
material in the <I>Planescape </I>setting can provide details about what the character might find.
<P></P>
Once the deity accepts the gift, it assigns some heroic task to the character.
(In a <I>Planescape </I>campaign, the character becomes the deity-s proxy, see <I>A Player's Guide to the Planes</I>.) Completing the task proves the character-s mettle. It is up to the DM to
create a suitable task and design a series of adventures so that the character
can complete it. A few examples follow:
<P></P>
<P></P>
Found a dynasty.
<P></P>
Create a new magical item or spell that others seek to imitate.
<P></P>
Find and destroy an artifact from an opposing alignment.
<P></P>
Find and defeat the avatar of a rival deity.
<P></P>
Build a lasting monument to the deity.
<P></P>
<P></P>
The DM and the player must work out the exact details. In any case, the
character must complete the task and earn enough experience to lower all saving throw
numbers to three. In addition, the character cannot have any ability score (or
subability score) lower than 13. When all of that is accomplished, the
character becomes a demigod and companion to the sponsor. The character becomes an NPC
under the DM-s control.
<P></P>
Some players may be upset that they have worked so hard to improve their
characters only to lose control of them to the DM. Remind them of their
contributions to the campaign world-new characters can worship their -retired?
heroes/demigods-and invite them to help construct the new powers? portfolios. AD&amp;D is a
game of heroes, not gods.
