<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Martial Arts </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Martial arts is a specialized form of pummeling that uses the body as a
weapon. A creature must be able to make pummeling attacks to employ a martial art.
Martial arts are difficult to learn and not commonly known. Generally, only
creatures with at least average intelligence and from mediative, nonmaterialistic
cultures can learn martial arts.
<P></P>
Martial arts requires at least one free hand. Unlike a character making normal
pummeling attacks, a martial artist must be bare-handed or wearing only normal
gloves and shoes. A martial art is a discipline of the mind and body and most
implements are avoided. Improvised weapons cannot be used in martial arts
attacks.
<P></P>
Martial arts attacks inflict mostly temporary damage, just as normal pummeling
attacks do. Marital arts attacks are ineffective against creatures normally
immune to pummeling attacks.
