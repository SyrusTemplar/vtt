The most common form of this weapon is a huge kettle placed in a frame that
allows it to tip and spill its contents on unfortunate opponents below. The same
effect can be obtained by suspending a barrel, bucket, or bladder from a beam
and tipping or splitting the container so that its contents spill out.
<P></P>
Unless otherwise noted, the contents of a cauldron pour down in a stream one
square wide. When it hits the ground, it forms a puddle three squares wide and
three squares long, centered on the point of impact. If there is a wall or
similar barrier that keeps the pool from spreading out, the pool is five squares
long and two squares wide, with the long side lying along the barrier.

The amount of damage a cauldron inflicts varies with the type of material in
it:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> Flaming oil burns for two rounds, inflicting 2d6 points of damage on the first
round and 1d6 points of damage on the second round;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> Boiling oil must be heated for at least one hour before use or it is treated
exactly like flaming oil (once heated its temperature can be maintained as long
as fuel is available). Boiling oil burns for two rounds, inflicting 4d6 points
of damage the first round and 1d6 points of damage on the second round;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> Boiling water is much cheaper than boiling oil. It must be heated for 30
minutes before use. Boiling water inflicts 2d4 points of damage when it strikes a
creature and 1d4 points of damage the round thereafter as it soaks into fur or
clothing and continues to scald. Creatures entering the area of effect on the
second round take no damage;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> Molten lead must be heated at least four hours before use, and the volume of
hot liquid is generally small. Molten lead forms a puddle two squares wide and
two squares long, with one square directly under the cauldron and spreading away
from the cauldron to the left or right as the attacker chooses. Molten lead
sears its targets for three rounds, inflicting 4d6 points of damage the first
round, 3d6 points of damage the second round, and 2d6 points of damage the third
round.
