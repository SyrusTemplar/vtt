</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Except where noted below, martial arts attacks are resolved as pummeling
attacks. A martial artist enjoys some advantages while pummeling, depending on the
style of martial arts he is using:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Style A: </B>The style emphasizes striking with the hands or fists. The character’s bare or
gloved hands are treated as small, hard objects (1d3 points of damage), and
the character can strike and damage creatures of any size. If the character is
unarmed and unarmored, he can make an extra attack each round with his other hand
(provided that it is free) without the usual penalties for attacking with two
weapons.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Style B:</B> The style emphasizes striking with the feet. The character’s bare or shod
feet are treated as large, hard objects (1d6 points of damage), and the character
can kick opponents even when they are not prone, sitting, or kneeling. If
unarmed and unarmored, the character can make an extra attack each round with one of
his free hands. Note that the ability to pummel creatures of any size is not
part of this style.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Style C:</B> The style emphasizes throws and escapes. The character can choose the
pull/trip combat option when making pummeling attacks. If the attack hits, the martial
artist can use either his Strength or Dexterity score for the opposed roll.
The martial artist also can make an opposed attack roll to escape any hold,
grapple, lock, or pin. The escape roll counts as an attack, but if it succeeds the
martial artist is considered clear and can finish the round normally.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Style D:</B> The style emphasizes dodges and blocks. The character can make one free block
each round in addition to any attacks he makes. If unarmed and unarmored, the
character receives a –2 Armor Class bonus.
