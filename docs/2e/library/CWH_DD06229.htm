The first step in researching a spell is defining exactly what the spell is
intended to accomplish. The player begins by making a rough draft of the proposed
spell, including its effects, school, range, duration, and area of effect. The
DM will then adjust these elements, making sure the proposed spell does not
duplicate the effects of an existing spell, or is not a minor variation of an
existing spell. The DM, working with the player, will establish the spell's
casting time, saving throw, and, most importantly, its level. (For help with
determining the elements of a new spell, see the <A HREF="DD06230.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD06230.htm">Spells section</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> in Chapter 2.)
<P></P>
Every proposed spell is not automatically acceptable. The DM can veto a
proposed spell for any of the following reasons:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> The player character already knows the maximum number of spells of the
proposed spell's level. (This is allowable if the optional Researching Extra Wizard
Spells rule on page 44 of the <A HREF="DMG_DD00362.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00362.htm">DMG</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> is being used.)
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> The proposed spell is not of a level allowed by the player character's
Intelligence, as per Table 4 of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>. (For instance, a wizard with an Intelligence of 9 cannot cast 4th-level
spells. Therefore, he cannot research them.)
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> The proposed spell belongs to a school in opposition to the player character's
school.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> The player proposes to research a spell of 10th-level or higher. (No spell can
exceed 9th- level.)
