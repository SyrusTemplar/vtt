Any spellcaster can recharge items, provided the character has access to the
required spells and the character can use the item. Mages can also recharge
items usable only by fighters or rogues.
<P></P>
To begin recharging, the character casts <I>enchant an item</I>—or performs the equivalent priest ceremony—to prepare the magical device and
then casts spells that the item absorbs to create charges.
<P></P>
The spell used to provide a charge must duplicate or nearly duplicate the
item’s power. If no spell duplicates the power, the character must research a new
spell or cast some combination of spells that resembles the power. If the item
has multiple functions, the spell must duplicate the item’s most powerful
function. For example, it takes a <I>cone of cold</I> spell to recharge a <I>wand of frost</I>.
<P></P>
Once the preparatory spell or ceremony is complete, the character has 24 hours
to create charges. Each spell used requires its normal casting time (not 2d4
hours per spell level as required by the <I>enchant an item</I> spell). When the initial enchantment fades, the character can prepare the
item again, but every time an item is prepared to receive charges it must save vs.
spell at the caster’s level with a –1 penalty. If the save fails, the item
falls into useless dust.
