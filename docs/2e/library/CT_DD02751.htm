</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This engine looks something like a giant crossbow mounted on a swivel. It
usually fires spear-like bolts, but some versions fire round shot of stone or
metal; both types use the same basic statistics. Ballista projectiles have a
relatively flat trajectory, and they are fairly accurate.
<P></P>
A light ballista can be aimed at any target in sight, provided the weapon is
fully crewed. A light ballista with a partial crew can fire at single creatures
of Large or greater size. A medium or heavy ballista can fire at a single Huge
creature, or at a Gargantuan creature if partially crewed. Any ballista-s field
of fire is limited to 45 degrees left or right of the weapon-s facing at the
beginning of the round. A ballista-s facing can be changed up to 45 degrees
during the last phase of any round when it fires.
