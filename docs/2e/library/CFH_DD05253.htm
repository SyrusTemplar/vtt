If a character spends one Weapon Proficiency Slot on Wrestling, and thus
specializes with Wrestling, he gains the following benefits:
<P></P>
He gains a +1 bonus to all his attack rolls with Wrestling;
<P></P>
He gains a +1 bonus to all damage with Wrestling (that is, all his maneuvers
will do 2 points of damage plus his Strength bonus, and continued holds cause
cumulatively 1 more point of damage for each round they are held);
<P></P>
He gains a +1 chart bonus with all Wrestling attacks;
<P></P>
He gains a +2 to Strength, only for maintaining a wrestling hold (i.e., a
Strength 15 character rolls against Strength 17 when maintaining a wrestling hold,
but only for that purpose); and
<P></P>
When he chooses to pull wrestling damage, the character may also pull the +2
to damage granted by specialization.
<P></P>
So if, for instance, he has a +1 chart bonus, and rolls a 16 on his attack
(Elbow Smash), he can instead choose a Trip or an Arm Lock. He'll decide based on
his current situation: If it's in his best interest to put his opponent on the
ground, he'll choose a Trip, and if it's better for him to have a maneuver that
allows him to hold onto his opponent from round to round, he'll choose an Arm
Lock.
<P></P>
It is possible for a Warrior to continue to improve his Wrestling abilities:
