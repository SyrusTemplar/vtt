<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Chime of Opening:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A <I>chime of opening</I> is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When it is struck, it sends forth
magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open.
The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, etc. The <I>chime of opening</I> also destroys the magic of a <I>hold portal</I> spell or even a <I>wizard lock</I> cast by a wizard of less than 15th level.
<P></P>
The chime must be pointed at the area of the item or gate which is to be
loosed or opened. It is then struck, a clear chiming ring sounds (which may attract
monsters), and in one round the target lock is unlocked, the shackle is loosed,
the secret door is opened, or the lid of the chest is lifted. If a chest is
chained, padlocked, locked, and <I>wizard locked,</I> it will take four soundings of the chime of opening to get it open. A <I>silence</I> spell negates the power of the device. The chime has 1d8 x 10 charges before
it cracks and becomes useless.
