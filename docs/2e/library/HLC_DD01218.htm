onion. When the player characters complete one adventure, they peel back a layer
and reveal another, deeper layer. The party gets closer and closer to resolving a
final, ultimate conflict as they continue to peel away layers. Usually, the
final conflict-s true nature is not obvious at the beginning, and the player
characters might stumble across several hints and clues before they realize where
their adventures are leading. The three adventures from the previous examples
could be arranged in layers as follows:

which the criminals wreak havoc. Perhaps a home of one of the heroes is raided.

A particularly methodical wizard who is a burglary victim notes that a set of
maps and commentary about a legendary sword are among the items taken from his
home. If the PCs follow up the lead, they discover that the gang of
dopplegangers responsible for the crimes have been turning over information about the
sword to their mysterious employer. The PCs also encounter an NPC who also is
seeking the sword, but is not implicated in the burglaries.

hidden. After enduring the puzzles and traps that guard the sword, and several
hit-and-run raids by mysterious attackers, the PCs recover the blade. There are
several attempts to steal the weapon, maybe even one from the PCs? erstwhile ally.

that an ancient vampire fears the sword, which has remained hidden for centuries.
The PCs and the vampire become locked in a deadly struggle that continues
until the party destroys the vampire or gives up the blade.
