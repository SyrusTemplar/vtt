</B>Types of Encounters </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Once you?ve created a workable plot for an adventure, you need encounters to
flesh it out. Encounters set the stage for the player characters and give them a
chance to function as heroes.

As this chapter?s first section points out, a well-designed adventure offers
several different types of encounters. Twelve different types of encounters are
described below. The categories are not definitive, and there often is
considerable overlap between them. Their purpose is not to force your encounters into
inflexible molds, but to help you consider the many options open to you when
planning them.
