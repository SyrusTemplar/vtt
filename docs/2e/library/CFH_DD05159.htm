<B>Character Description:</B> This character has just recently become an adventurer, and he doesn't have
much experience or common sense . . . meaning that he gets in trouble, and leads
his companions into trouble, quite often. Therefore, <I>you should only choose a Brash Youth personality when you're willing to
role-play this attitude.</I> The Brash Youth is easy prey for fast-talkers and con men, suggests
straightforward and foolish plans sure to get the party captured or killed, admires more
experienced warriors without questioning their motives, and can be quite a
menace to himself unless taken in hand by a more experienced adventurer.
<P></P>
Inevitably, a Brash Youth character has to &quot;wise up&quot;—to lose some of his
preconceptions and naivete. If this doesn't happen naturally in the course of a
campaign, the DM should design an adventure around the Brash Youth, an adventure
where he's confronted with the consequences of his brashness. For instance, a
confidence man could trick the Youth into accidentally betraying his allies; or, a
Youth's plan could go horribly awry and seriously or critically endanger his
friends; or, a hero particularly admired by the Youth could turn out to be far
less admirable than the Youth has always thought.
<P></P>
When this happens, the character must stop being a Brash Youth and choose some
other personality type. By now, he should have been playing long enough that
the player will know what sort of personality that is; alternatively, the events
that shock him out of being a Brash Youth could affect him seriously enough
that this event chooses his new personality for him (this results in such
personalities as a disillusioned Crude Crusher or a hostile Dangerous Antagonist).
<P></P>
<B>Best Suited For:</B> In terms of alignment, the Brash Youth is best suited to the full range of
Good and Neutral alignments (L/G, L/N, N/G, N, C/G C/N). Evil characters aren't
suited to being naive and trusting. In terms of Warrior Kits, the Brash Youth is
admirably suited to all of them! The only kit that might give you a problem is
that of the Samurai, but it's possible to play an inexperienced and eager
Samurai struggling to keep his enthusiasm from showing beneath the veneer of
eastern detachment; this is an especially good choice in an all-samurai campaign,
where one character is the brash young warrior interacting with more experienced
and settled samurai.
<P></P>
<B>In Combat Situations:</B> The Brash Youth is likely just to charge up to a foe and begin pounding away,
unless that foe is so big and scary that even the most foolish youth will be
afraid of it. He's very likely to take combat orders from his friends, however,
so it's easy for one wiser warrior to keep him from killing himself through bad
tactics. It's often a good idea for the party to make the Brash Youth one of
their designated archers, because it usually keeps him out of direct
hand-to-hand combat until he has wised up.
<P></P>
The Brash Youth <I>can</I> learn from his experiences, on a case-by-case basis. After he's been hammered
by a troll, he can be more cautious with the next troll or troll-like monster
he encounters. But he'll be just as brash with a monster unlike the others he's
encountered . . .
<P></P>
<B>In Role-Playing Situations:</B> The Brash Youth gets along with everybody until such time as the other person
insults one of his friends, challenges one of his preconceptions, or betrays
him. Even then, he'll simply be furious and willing to fight or oppose the other
fellow; to be truly <I>vengeful</I> requires that the Youth go through his personality change and take on a new
personality.
<P></P>
The Brash Youth should be played as either hesitant and nervous in new
situations, or eager to throw himself into such situations—he's never bored or
indifferent. Other characters find his youthfulness charming, but may also find him
exasperating because he's always getting into trouble.
