</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Attacks from creatures with this power inflict damage that cannot be healed by
regeneration, first aid, or by any magical means (short of a <I>wish</I>, 10th level healing spell, or a <I>periapt of wound closure</I>). Wounds caused by more powerful legendary monsters bleed freely, inflicting
additional damage each round until the wound is bound or a healing spell is
applied. Healing spells used in this manner donâ€™t restore any lost hit points,
they just prevent additional bleeding damage.
