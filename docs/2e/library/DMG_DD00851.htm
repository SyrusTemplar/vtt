<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wand of Fear:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> When the <I>fear</I> wand is activated, a pale amber ray springs from the tip of the wand, forming
a cone 60 feet long by 20 feet in base diameter, which flashes on and
instantly disappears. Each creature touched by the ray must roll a successful saving
throw vs. wand or react as per the <I>cause fear</I> spell (1st-level priest spell, <I>remove fear</I> rversal). In other words, creatures affected by the wand turn and move at
fastest possible speed away from the wielder for six rounds. Each use costs one
charge. It can operate just once per round. The wand can be recharged.
