When a priest casts a <I>find traps</I> spell, all traps--concealed normally or magically--of magical or mechanical
nature become apparent to him. Note that this spell is directional, and the
caster must face the desired direction in order to determine if a trap is laid in
that particular direction.
<P></P>
A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can inflict
a sudden or unexpected result, the spellcaster would view the result as
undesirable or harmful, and the harmful or undesirable result was specifically
intended as such by the creator. Thus, traps include alarms, glyphs, and similar
spells or devices.
<P></P>
The caster learns the general nature of the trap (magical or mechanical) but
not its exact effect, nor how to disarm it. Close examination will, however,
enable the caster to sense what intended actions might trigger it. Note that the
caster's divination is limited to his knowledge of what might be unexpected and
harmful. The spell cannot predict actions of creatures (hence, a concealed
murder hole or ambush is not a trap), nor are natural hazards considered traps (a
cavern that floods during a rain, a wall weakened by age, a naturally poisonous
plant, etc.). If the DM is using specific glyphs or sigils to identify magical
wards (see the 3rd-level spell <A HREF="DD02182.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="DD02182.htm">glyph of warding</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">), this spell shows the form of the glyph or mark. The spell does not detect
traps that have been disarmed or are otherwise inactive.
