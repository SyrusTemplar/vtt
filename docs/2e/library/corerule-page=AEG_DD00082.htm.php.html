An incendiary arrow is any arrow type (except bone or stone) with a wad of
hemp soaked in a bituminous substance (such as tar) placed just beneath the head.
The hemp is lit before the arrow is fired.
<P></P>
In addition to its normal damage, the arrow causes one additional hit point of
fire damage on the round of impact unless the target makes a saving throw vs.
death magic. At the DM's option, flaming arrows may ignite combustible
materials contacting it.
