The character is skilled at concealing or manipulating small items and
familiar with such tricks as pulling a coin from a child’s ear, separating two joined
rings, or causing a pigeon or rabbit to vanish. For the most part, nothing more
than manual dexterity and showmanship are required, and any kind of character
may learn prestidigitation.
<P></P>
While true wizards have little time for these parlor tricks, many apprentices
practice with their <I>cantrips </I>by duplicating these feats. A wizard with a <I>cantrip </I>spell handy can really manipulate a small object by briefly <I>levitating </I>it, <I>teleport </I>something small from one hand to the other, or use a tiny dimensional pocket
to make an object disappear or seem to contain something it shouldn’t.
<P></P>
There is no particular game effect for prestidigitation, although it is a form
of entertainment and can earn a wizard his dinner with a good performance, or
possibly distract or fool an NPC under very limited circumstances. For example,
a wizard trying to conceal a wand or precious gem from a robber searching him
at knifepoint might be able to hide the item with a successful proficiency
check.
