The creature receiving this spell is protected from normal extremes of cold or
heat (depending on which application the priest selects at the time of
casting). The creature can stand unprotected in temperatures as low as -30 F. or as
high as 130 F. (depending on application) with no ill effect. Temperatures
beyond these limits inflict 1 point of damage per hour of exposure for every degree
beyond the limit. The spell is immediately cancelled if the recipient is
affected by any non-normal heat or cold, such as magic, breath weapons, and so on.
The cancellation occurs regardless of the application and regardless of whether
a heat or cold effect hits the character (for example, an <I>endure cold</I> spell is cancelled by magical heat or fire as well as by magical cold). The
recipient of the spell does not suffer the first 10 points of damage (after any
applicable saving throws) from the heat or cold during the round in which the
spell is broken. The spell ends instantly if either <I>resist fire</I> or <I>resist cold</I> is cast upon the recipient.
