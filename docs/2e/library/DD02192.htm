Upon casting this spell, the priest is usually able to remove a curse on an
object, on a person, or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence.
Note that the <I>remove curse</I> spell does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of
armor, for example, although the spell typically enables the person afflicted with
any such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be
countered by this spell, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or
more. A caster of 12th level or more can cure lycanthropy with this spell by
casting it on the animal form. The were-creature receives a saving throw vs. spell
and, if successful, the spell fails and the priest must gain a level before
attempting the remedy on this creature again.
<P></P>
The reverse of the spell is not permanent; the <I>bestow curse</I> spell lasts for one turn for every experience level of the priest using the
spell. The curse can have one of the following effects (roll percentile dice):
50% of the time it reduces one ability of the victim to 3 (the DM randomly
determines which ability); 25% of the time it lowers the victim's attack and saving
throw rolls by -4; 25% of the time it makes the victim 50% likely to drop
whatever he is holding (or do nothing, in the case of creatures not using
tools)--roll each round.
<P></P>
It is possible for a priest to devise his own curse, and it should be similar
in power to those given here. Consult your DM. The subject of a <I>bestow curse</I> spell must be touched. If the victim is touched, a saving throw is still
applicable; if it is successful, the effect is negated. The bestowed curse cannot
be dispelled.
