<TITLE>Tighrope Walking-- Nonweapon Proficiency (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Tightrope Walking:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The character with this proficiency can balance on ropes, wires, slender
beams, and other narrow, perilous surfaces. A typical movement rate is 60 feet a
round, though an upward angle will slow this. Ascents and descents of 45 degrees
or more are not possible.
<P></P>
The character does not require a proficiency check if the surface is at least
4&quot; wide. Narrower surfaces require checks, with failure indicating a fall. If
walking on a flat surface more than an inch wide, the character receives a +3
modifier to the check. A balance pole adds another +2 modifier, though high winds
or a moving surface can contribute significant negatives.
<P></P>
If the character makes an attack or suffers damage while balanced on a rope, a
proficiency check is required. Failure signals a fall. Subtract the number of
points of damage the character suffered from the proficiency rating when this
check is made. Attacks made while on the rope suffer ?5 penalties on attack
rolls. Also, a character walking on a tightrope has limited maneuverability and
therefore does not gain an AC bonus for Dexterity.
