<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Engineering:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> This proficiency is required for the design and construction of objects and
installations of all sizes. Note that carpentry, stonemasonry, blacksmithing, or
other proficiencies also might be necessary for the actual building.
Characters can design and supervise the building of houses, boats, small bridges,
palisades, and towers—of up to about 30 feet high without proficiency checks.

Characters with this skill can try to design large bridges, fortresses, ships,
war machines, locks and dams, and other more complicated projects. Plans for
these types of objects generally require at least a week—more if an
exceptionally large project is being attempted. Complicated tasks require successful
proficiency checks before a workable design can be made. If a check fails on a roll
of less than 20, however, the engineer will be aware of the failure and can seek
to create a new design—go back to the drawing board, so to speak. On a roll of
20, the design is flawed but the danger will not be discovered until after the
object is built.
