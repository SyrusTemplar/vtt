Illusions are seldom perfect, and wary subjects will always be alerted to an
image's illusionary nature by its imperfections. For instance, if a wizard uses
a spell such as <I>phantasmal force</I> to create an illusionary creature, the creature might lack one or more
obvious sensory elements, such as sound, aroma, or body temperature, which can be a
dead giveaway that the creature is only an illusion. In extreme cases, the
subject's saving throw can be modified by as much as +4. If the wizard is using a
better spell, such as improved <I>phantasmal force</I>, any sensory elements lacking in the illusion will not be as obvious, and the
subject's saving throw rarely will be modified by more than +2.

Examples:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> An illusion of a bee. Saving throw modifier: +1 (<I>phantasmal force</I>), 0 (<I>improved phantasmal</I> <I>force</I>) . The illusionary bee won't buzz in a lower-level illusion, but it will in
the higher-level spell.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> An illusion of a hissing fire lizard covered with filth. Saving throw
modifier: +4 (<I>phantasmal force</I>), +1 (<I>improved phantasmal force</I>). The lower-level illusion won't be able to duplicate the lizard's hiss, body
heat, or the smell of the filth. The higher-level spell will do a better job,
but the modifier assumes that at least one of these elements is imperfect or
missing.
