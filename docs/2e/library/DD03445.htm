Monsters </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Naturally, human and demihuman characters aren-t the only spellcasters in the
AD&amp;D game. The most powerful types of undead, the vampire and the lich, can
command devastating magical abilities. Many extraplanar creatures have some degree
of skill as wizards or priests, and every tribe of humanoids boasts a shaman
or witch-doctor of some kind. In fact, many monsters are more skilled with
spellcasting than the player characters of a campaign.
<P></P>
In addition to monstrous spellcasters, there are also hordes of creatures with
magical powers that resemble spells. The most dangerous extradimensional
monsters have a selection of spell-like powers that rivals the spell capability of a
high-level wizard. Other creatures, such as dragons, gain both spell-like
abilities and the power to actually cast wizard or priest spells.
