This spell enables the caster to enchant a floor, ceiling, or single wall of a
room to crush intruders. The enchanted surface can be no larger than a square
whose sides equal the caster's level times 2 feet (a 13th-level priest could
affect a 26' x 26' surface).
<P></P>
The spell activates 1d4 rounds after any creature other than the caster enters
the room. The intruder must be larger than a normal rat (larger than one-half
cubic foot or weighing more than three pounds). When activated, the enchanted
surface moves toward the opposite surface at a rate of 3 feet per round. Unless
the spell is canceled by the caster, the enchanted surface continues to move
until one of the following events occurs:
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">•</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A creature with sufficient Strength (minimum score of 19) stops the enchanted
surface from moving by succeeding a Strength check. Such a creature suffers no
damage from the enchanted surface. If the creature prevents the enchanted
surface from moving for three consecutive rounds, the wall returns to its original
position and the spell is negated. If multiple creatures attempt to stop the
wall, the highest strength score is used as a base score; one point is added to
that score for every creature assisting. Thus, a creature with 16 Strength
assisted by three creatures could attempt to stop the wall.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">•</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A strong or heavy object made of stone, wood, or metal is placed in the path
of the wall. If the item survives a saving throw vs. crushing blow, the object
successfully braces the wall. If the object holds for three consecutive rounds,
the surface returns to its original position and the spell is negated. The DM
must use discretion in determining the types of objects that will brace the
wall.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">•</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>Dispel magic</I> or a similar spell or magical item is used to cancel the crushing wall.
<P></P>
Creatures can avoid being crushed by using a <I>potion of diminution, potion of gaseous form</I>, or other devices or spells that reduce size. The <I>crushing wall</I> almost never touches the opposite wall, usually being stopped by debris. A
gap of two inches or more usually remains between the walls.
<P></P>
If the wall is not stopped, it causes crushing damage to everyone in the room.
All creatures must make a saving throw vs. death. Those who fail are crushed
to death. Those who save successfully suffer 5d10 points of damage. When the
wall can move no farther, it returns to its original position and the spell is
negated.
<P></P>
The material components are a 1-inch iron cube and a walnut shell.
