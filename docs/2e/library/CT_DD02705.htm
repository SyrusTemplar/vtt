<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Martial Arts Talents
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Once a character is proficient in at least one martial arts style, she can
acquire, with the DM?s approval, a variety of additional skills that reflect her
advanced mental and physical training. Only a martial artist can learn the
skills presented here. They can be purchased with either weapon or nonweapon
proficiency slots.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="d1d3edc2"></A><B>Flying Kick </B>(1 slot/3 CP) Strength/Muscle
<P></P>
Groups: Warrior Initial rating: 5
<P></P>
The character can leap high into the air, leading with a powerful kick that
can strike opponents up to three squares away. The character can land in any
square adjacent to the target, as long as it is within two squares of the
attacker?s starting position. If the character is not proficient in style B, this
maneuver is the only attack she can make in the round, and the kick inflicts 2d4
points of damage. Strength bonuses to the attack and damage rolls apply, but
specialization and mastery bonuses from another marital arts style do not.
<P></P>
If the character is proficient in style B, this maneuver can replace one kick
attack each round, and the kick inflicts 2d6 points of damage. Strength bonuses
apply to the attack and damage rolls. If the character is a style B specialist
or master, the appropriate bonuses also apply.
<P></P>
If the character has at least one square of running room and declares a half
move action, no ability check is required. If the character has no running room
or declares a no move action, a Strength/Muscle check is required. If the
ability check fails, the attack automatically misses as the character falls down in
her landing square.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="68ce470a"></A><B>Backward Kick</B> (1 slot/ 3 CP) N/A
<P></P>
Groups: Warrior, Priest, Rogue
<P></P>
The character can attack an opponent standing in one of her rear squares
either by lashing backward or kicking over her own head. This maneuver does not
provoke attacks of opportunity (but deliberately turning one?s back on an opponent
does). This maneuver works best for characters proficient in style B, similar
to the flying kick described above.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="ecec02c1"></A><B>Spring</B> (1 slot/3 CP) Dexterity/Balance
<P></P>
Groups: Warrior, Rogue Initial rating: 5
<P></P>
The character can make astonishing jumps and leaps with blinding speed. At the
cost of a half move or an attack, the character can spring into the air,
attaining a height of five feet and landing up to two squares away in any direction.
The character can flip and twist while airborne to achieve any facing when he
lands. If the character has a 2-square running start, he can double his
springing distance, landing up to four squares away and leaping 10 feet in the air,
but the running start is a half-move action. For every additional slot spent on
this skill, the character can add five feet and one square to the distance
achieved.
<P></P>
For example, a character who as spent two slots on this skill could leap 10
feet into the air and land up to three squares away from a standing start. If the
character?s Dexterity/Balance roll fails, the character falls down in his
landing square; he can get up during his next action phase, but can take no other
actions until the following round. If the ability check succeeds, the character
can finish the round normally after landing.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="6f8bb706"></A><B>Crushing Blow</B> (1 slot/3 CP) N/A
<P></P>
Groups: Warrior, Priest, Rogue
<P></P>
The character can break hard objects with her hands (or feet if she uses style
B). Under ideal conditions, the character can break a wooden board 1/2? thick
per level or 1/4? slab of stone or brick per level. Objects that are
exceptionally strong, reinforced, supported by other objects (such as bricks in a wall),
or not shaped like boards receive a saving throw roll vs. crushing blow to
avoid breakage. When used against a creature, the crushing blow does normal damage
plus 1 point per level. A crushing blow requires intense concentration. It is a
no-move action, and the character can take no other actions during the round
when she uses the crushing blow.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="457dbb20"></A><B>Instant Stand</B> (1 slot/3 CP) Dexterity/Balance
<P></P>
Groups: Warrior, Priest, Rogue Initial rating: 7
<P></P>
The character can instantly regain his feet after falling down. If the ability
check succeeds, the character can ignore the effects of knockdowns or failed
spring attempts. If the ability check fails, the character can get up during his
next action phase, but cannot take any further actions until the next round.
Characters cannot use this skill while pinned, locked, held, or grappled.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="4b028fae"></A><B>Missile Deflection</B> (1 slot/3 CP) N/A
<P></P>
Groups: Warrior, Priest, Rogue
<P></P>
The character can perform block maneuvers (see <A HREF="DD02481.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02481.htm">Chapter Two</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) against normal missiles fired at her from the front. The character can use
her free change of facing (see <A HREF="DD02374.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02374.htm">Chapter One</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) to turn toward an attacker firing missiles from her flank or rear, but this
counts as her change of facing for the round.
<P></P>
Normal missiles include mundane and enchanted arrows, axes, bolts, javelins,
small stones, and spears. Large or magical missiles, such as ballista bolts,
hurled boulders, and magic missile spells, cannot be deflected.
