The <I>domination</I> spell enables the caster to control the actions of any person until the spell
is ended by the subject's Intelligence (see the <A HREF="DD01815.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01815.htm">charm person</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> spell). Elves and half-elves resist this enchantment as they do all <I>charm</I>-type spells. When the spell is cast, the subject must roll a saving throw vs.
spell at a penalty of -2, but Wisdom adjustments apply. Failure means the
wizard has established a telepathic link with the subject's mind. If a common
language is shared, the wizard can generally force the subject to perform as the
wizard desires, within the limits of the subject's body structure and Strength.
Note that the caster does not receive direct sensory input from the subject.
<P></P>
Subjects resist this control, and those forced to take actions against their
natures receive a new saving throw with a bonus of +1 to +4, depending on the
type of action required. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out.
Once control is established, there is no limit to the range at which it can be
exercised, as long as the caster and subject are on the same plane.
<P></P>
A <I>protection from evil</I> spell can prevent the caster from exercising control or using the telepathic
link while the subject is so warded, but it cannot prevent the establishment of
domination.
