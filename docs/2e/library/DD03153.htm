<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Armor Proficiency</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character can spend a weapon proficiency slot to buy the armor
proficiency, which indicates that he has become used to wearing a protective shell. Unlike
the shield proficiency, the armor proficiency does not improve armor class.
Instead, it reduces the encumbrance penalties for the wearing of a particular
kind of armor. Thus, a character who is fully proficient with the use of his plate
mail, for example, can move around a lot more easily and quickly than can a
character who does not have this proficiency.
<P></P>
A character with the armor proficiency suffers only half the normal
encumbrance load of his armor. For example, full plate armor weighs 70 pounds. However,
if a character is proficient with that type of armor, the armor has the
encumbrance effect of only 35 pounds. Naturally, the armor retains its full weight for
all other purposesâ€”such as swimming!
