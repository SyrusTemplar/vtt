</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The priest is a believer and advocate of a god from a particular mythos. More
than just a follower, he intercedes and acts on behalf of others, seeking to
use his powers to advance the beliefs of his mythos.
<P></P>
All priests have certain powers: The ability to cast spells, the strength of
arm to defend their beliefs, and special, deity-granted powers to aid them in
their calling. While priests are not as fierce in combat as warriors, they are
trained to use weaponry in the fight for their cause. They can cast spells,
primarily to further their god's aims and protect its adherents. They have few
offensive spells, but these are very powerful.
<P></P>
All priests use eight-sided Hit Dice (d8s). Only priests gain additional
spells for having high Wisdom scores. All priests have a limited selection of
weapons and armor, but the restrictions vary according to the mythos.

<P></P>
All priests spells are divided into 16 categories called <I> spheres of influence. </I> Different types of priests have access to different spheres; no priest can
cast spells from every sphere of influence. The 16 spheres of influence are as
follows: All, Animal, Astral, Charm, Combat, Creation, Divination, Elemental,
Guardian, Healing, Necromantic, Plant, Protection, Summoning, Sun, and Weather.
<P></P>
In addition, a priest has either major or minor access to a sphere. A priest
with major access to a sphere can (eventually) cast all spells in the sphere. A
priest with minor access to a sphere can cast only 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-level
spells from that sphere.
<P></P>
All priests gain one eight-sided Hit Die (1d8) Per level from 1st through 9th. <I>After 9th level, priests earn 2 hit points per level and they no longer gain
additional hit point bonuses for high Constitution scores.</I>
