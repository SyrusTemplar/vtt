<FONT SIZE="3">A more potent form of the lesser <I>sign of sealing</I>,
this spell allows the caster to guard an item or portal and prevent
all other creatures from opening or passing through the sealed item
or surface. The <I>greater sign </I>has several effects; first of
all, it affects a doorway or item that opens (a chest, for instance)
as a wizard lock spell. If placed in an open corridor or archway to
prevent passage, the <I>greater sign </I>creates a magical barrier
that repels all who try to pass.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Second, the <I>greater sign </I>greatly strengthens
the physical structure of any door or item it is placed upon,
granting a +6 bonus on any item saving throws and allowing the item
or door to ignore 1 point of damage per caster level from any attack.
For example, a <I>greater sign </I>cast by a 12th-level wizard would
reduce the damage of any blow or spell by 12 points, so a fighter
armed with a broad sword (maximum damage of 8 points) could never
hack through a door protected by the sign.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Finally, if the protected doorway or item is forced
open or destroyed by any means, the sign itself is not only
destroyed, but also releases a spell upon the offending creature. The
spell held by the sign is cast into the ward when the greater sign is
created, and any spell the caster has memorized may be used in this
way, from a <I>fireball </I>or <I>shocking grasp </I>to a very nasty <I>wish
</I>or <I>polymorph</I>. The range of the sign&#146;s retributive
spell is 10 yards per caster level, so it is possible to destroy the
warding from a safe distance.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The sign is displayed in plain sight, and most wizards
will recognize it for what it is. The caster cannot specify
particular creatures or conditions for the sign&#146;s operation; it
functions against any creature that attempts to pass it, although the
wizard can freely pass through his own sign without activating it.
The <I>greater sign </I>can be removed by the caster, thus ending the
spell, or it can be defeated by a <I>limited wish </I>or <I>wish </I>spell
cast by a wizard of equal or higher level than the original caster;
it cannot be dispelled.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The material component for a greater sign is a
powdered diamond worth at least 1,000 gold pieces.</FONT></P>
