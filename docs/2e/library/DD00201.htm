Before choosing to use this method, think about how adventurers fit into the
population as a whole. There are two schools of thought.
<P></P>
One holds that adventurers are no different from everyone else (except for
being a little more foolhardy, headstrong, or restless). The man or woman down the
street could be an adventurer--all that's required is the desire to go out and
be one. Therefore, adventurers should get no special bonuses on their ability
rolls.
<P></P>
The other school holds that adventurers are special people, a cut above the
common crowd. If they weren't exceptional, they would be laborers and businessmen
like everyone else. Player characters are heroes, so they should get bonuses
on their ability rolls to lift them above the rabble.
<P></P>
If you choose method V for creating player characters, then you agree with
this second view and believe that adventurers should be better than everyone else.
<P></P>
This method creates above-average characters. They won't be perfect, but the
odds are that even their worst ability scores will be average or better. More
scores push into the exceptional range (15 and greater). It is easy for a player
to create a character of any class and race.

one takes some time. It also creates a tendency toward &quot;super&quot; characters.
<P></P>
Unless you have a considerable amount of experience as a DM, however, beware
of extremely powerful characters. They are much more difficult to challenge and
control than characters of moderate power. On the plus side, their chance for
survival at lower levels is better than &quot;ordinary&quot; characters. (See &quot;<A HREF="DD00205.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00205.htm">Super Characters</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> ,&quot; below, for more on this subject.)
<P></P>
One last point about method V: High ability scores are less exciting under
this method, since they are much more common, as the fighter characters below
indicate:
