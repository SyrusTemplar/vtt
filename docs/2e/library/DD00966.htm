<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Helm of Telepathy:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This sturdy metal helmet appears to be a normal piece of headgear, although it
will radiate magic if this is detected for. The wearer of a <I>helm of telepathy</I> is able to determine the thoughts of creatures within a 60-foot range. There
are two limitations on this power: The wearer must know the language used by
such creatures (the racial tongue will be used in thoughts in preference to the
Common, the Common in preference to alignment languages); and there can't be
more than 3 feet of solid stone, 3 inches of iron, or any solid sheeting of lead
or gold between the wearer and the creatures.

The thought pick-up is directional. Conscious effort must be made to pick up
thoughts. The wearer may communicate by language with any creature within range
if there is a mutually known speech, or emotions may be transmitted (empathy)
so that a creature will receive the emotional message of the wearer.

Intelligence lower than the telepathist, but a +1 bonus for every point of
Intelligence higher than the wearer of the helm. If Intelligence is equal, no
adjustment is made when the saving throw is rolled.
