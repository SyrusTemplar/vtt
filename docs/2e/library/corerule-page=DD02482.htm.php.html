<P></P>
A called shot is an attack at a specific location on the target. For example,
a called shot can be used to attack the head of an enemy who isn’t wearing a
helm, the unarmored legs of a character wearing only a breastplate, or the
special weakness of a monster with an Achilles’ heel.
<P></P>
Called shots have to be announced before the attack roll is made. When the
called shot is announced, the character’s action phase is delayed by one category;
a bowshot that would normally be in the average phase becomes a slow action if
the archer decides to make a called shot. If you’re not playing with the
initiative system described in <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02409.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02409.htm.php.html">Chapter One</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, assume called shots receive a +1 initiative penalty.
<P></P>
Called shots normally present the attacker with a –4 penalty on his attack
roll, but the DM can modify this for the circumstances. If the target is surprised
or not expecting the attack, the called shot modifier may not apply at all. On
the other hand, a particularly difficult called shot (stabbing an enemy
through the eyeslit of his visor, for example) may inflict a –6 or even a –8 penalty
to the attack roll. Called shots are disrupted if the character attempting it
suffers a knockdown.
<P></P>
Although called shots are normally most useful for special combat effects,
like breaking a beaker of acid in an evil wizard’s hand, they can also be useful
against partially unarmored opponents. An enemy in full plate mail with no
helmet has an AC 10 head; it’s easier to make the called shot with a –4 penalty
against that AC 10 than to swing at the enemy’s normal AC of 1. If a called shot is
used to strike a specific body area and results in a critical hit, ignore the
location die of the critical hit roll and just roll the effect for the area
struck. (See <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02712.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02712.htm.php.html">Chapter Six</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> for more information on critical hits.)
<P></P>
Called shots can also be used to fire missile weapons into a melee without the
risk of hitting an ally. If the called shot misses, no one else is in danger
of being hit by the missile.
<P></P>
As an optional rule, the DM may allow called shots to be used to force an
automatic retreat or knockdown effect, rather than inflict damage.
