bodies, and the influence of that movement upon the beings of the campaign world.

legends behind their naming. The character can make limited predictions for the
future, always in vague terms?whether these are accurate is up to the DM. A
character with this proficiency gains +2 on all checks made using the navigation

gains a +1 bonus to the astrology proficiency rating.
