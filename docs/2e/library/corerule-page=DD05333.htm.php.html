<P></P>

<P></P>
The exotic, oriental world features many weapons which are strange to western
eyes . . . including the eyes of the PCs in most campaigns.
<P></P>
Many of these weapons simply look a little different and bear different names.
Old, familiar weapons with slightly changed forms and names include: the
Battle axe, Hand axe, Dagger (tanto), Halberd, Javelin, Light lance, Mace, Pike,
Spear, Long sword, Short sword, Two-handed sword (no-daichi), and Trident. These
weapons have game characteristics identical to the normal versions, and
proficiency with the common weapon works just as well with the more exotic version.
<P></P>
The new samurai-society weapons listed in the chart above include:
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Bo Stick</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
The bo stick is an ordinary hardwood staff, the height of a man or slightly
taller.
<P></P>
Bo stick shares a proficiency with Quarterstaff. If you can use one, you can
use the other. (This doesn't mean that the two styles are identical; an oriental
bo stick fighter looks very different in combat than a western quarterstaff
combatant. But if they traded weapons, they'd be just as good with the other
guy's weapon . . . each in his own style.) Weapon specialization in bo stick gives
you the usual advantages.
<P></P>
Bo sticks are common everywhere; any 6' or 7' hardwood walking staff is a bo
staff. To use it as such, however, you have to have the bo stick/quarterstaff
weapon proficiency. The primary difference between the weapons, and the reason
the quarterstaff does more damage against Large monsters, is that the combat
quarterstaff has iron-shod, even lead-weighted ends. (A quarterstaff which does not
have these features should do damage identical to the bo stick.)
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Chain
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
This weapon is a 6' or 10' length of chain with weights at both ends. In
combat, it's whirled very fast, the weighted end inflicting the damage on the target.
<P></P>
The chain combines some of the useful traits of melee weapons and the lasso.
You can attack with it for normal Called Shots, Disarm, Parry, and Strike/Thrust
maneuvers. Additionally, you can perform three of the lasso's five special
functions: Pull/Trip by striking at a target's legs, Dismount a Rider, and Snag a
Rider's Head.
<P></P>
The chain is easy to conceal, and (at least in western lands) is not usually
recognized as a weapon until wielded as one.
<P></P>
The chain requires its own weapons proficiency, which is not related to any
other weapon. Weapon specialization confers the usual bonuses.
<P></P>
Chains are to be found in any civilization with the technological skill to
make them (this includes most <I>AD&amp;D®</I> campaign settings), but the technique of fighting with them is mostly an
eastern-culture development. A character would have to study with a practitioner of
the technique, and be able to spend a weapon proficiency slot, in order to
learn how to use the weapon.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Daikyu
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The daikyu is the great samurai longbow. It's 7' long (hence its size
designation of L). Its hand-grip is not in the center of the weapon; it's located
closer to the bottom, so the daikyu can be fired from horseback and from kneeling
positions.
<P></P>
As with other bows, the daikyu can be used to perform the Called Shot, Disarm,
Hold Attack, and Strike/Thrust (i.e., shoot) maneuvers.
<P></P>
The daikyu and katana are the two principal weapons of the samurai.
<P></P>
The daikyu requires its own weapons proficiency. It is related to, but not
identical to, other bow proficiencies. Weapon specialization confers the usual
benefits.
<P></P>
The daikyu is not exported from eastern nations. However, it is a simple task,
if you are in such a nation, to commission the making of one. A western bowyer
would have to have studied in the east to make one.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Katana
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The katana is the samurai's sword. It's a medium-length, slightly curved blade
with no quillions (only a small, circular guard) and a hilt suitable for
one-handed and two-handed use. The blade is sharpened only along one edge and at the
tip, but it is sharpened to a razor's edge. It is forged with a special
technique known only in the east, where layers of steel and iron are sandwiched,
heated, folded, stretched, re-folded, stretched, re-folded, on and on until the
blade consists of microscopically thin layers of alternating metals, providing
strength, resilience, and the ability to hold a remarkable edge. This is why the
katana has the excellent speed and damage listed for the weapon.
<P></P>
The katana requires its own weapon proficiency, which is related to the
bastard sword/long blades group. Weapon specialization confers the usual benefits.
<P></P>
Katanas are very personal; a samurai is dishonored if he loses his, and so
very few are lost. This means that it is very hard to get one in the west, other
than by taking it from its owner—a difficult task. In the east, a character
might be willing to commission one from a weaponsmith, for the listed price . . .
if he gets a good reaction roll from the NPC. (An ordinary weaponsmith could not
make one. The blade-making technique requires study in the east and the
learning of a specialized individual weaponsmithing nonweapon proficiency.)
<P></P>
Also, a hero who does a favor or performs a mission for an eastern lord might
be awarded a matched set of katana and wakizashi, if he's very lucky; this
would be a high honor.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Naginata
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
This is a polearm, a 6' to 8' shaft with a curved, sword-like blade at the
end. It's the favored weapon of the female fighters of the orient, but they are
not limited to it, nor is it limited to them.
<P></P>
Naginata proficiency is related to all other polearms. Weapon specialization
confers the usual benefits.
<P></P>
Naginatas are readily available in oriental ports, and such weapons are
readily exported, if the DM says there is a market for them.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Nunchaku</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
The nunchaku consists of two lengths of hard wood connected by a short length
of chain or rope.
<P></P>
The weapon can be used to perform Called Shots, Disarm, Parry, and
Strike/Thrust maneuvers.
<P></P>
Nunchaku requires its own proficiency, which is not related to any other
weapons proficiency (including flails). Weapon specialization confers the usual
benefits. Masters of the weapon often have weapon specialization in nunchaku and
Style Specialization in Two-Weapons Style, giving them the ability to fight
effectively with nunchaku in either hand. The only way to acquire this proficiency
is to study with someone who already has the proficiency, and to have a
proficiency slot available to spend on nunchaku.
<P></P>
Nunchaku are readily available in oriental ports, and such weapons are
exported; western collectors are quite enthusiastic about them, even if these
collectors usually cannot use them.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Sai</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
This is a short, defensive weapon, consisting of a metal bar with a hilt, and
oversized upward-curving quillions. When used by someone with proficiency in
the weapon, sai confer a +1 to attack rolls bonus when using the Pin and Disarm
maneuvers.
<P></P>
In the chart at the start of this chapter, the Sai is listed as having two
types of damage: P (piercing) and B (bludgeoning). That's not quite right; the
normal sai is only a Bludgeoning-damage weapon. However, certain warriors prefer
for it to be a sharp stabbing weapon, so the damage may be Piercing instead. A
sai may only have one type of damage, not both.
<P></P>
Sai requires its own proficiency, which is not related to any other. Weapon
specialization confers the usual benefits. To learn the proficiency, one must
study with someone who has it, and the character must have a weapon proficiency
slot to spend.
<P></P>
Many warriors proficient in the sai take Style Specialization in Two-Weapon
technique and utilize twin sai in combat.
<P></P>
Sai are readily available in oriental ports, and are exported.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Shuriken
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Shuriken, often called throwing stars, are small thrown weapons. They do as
much damage as a thrown dagger, and are considerably more concealable. Ornamental
shuriken can often be worn as jewelry and not recognized as weapons, and a
pocketful of shuriken weigh no more than many other single weapons.
<P></P>
However, shuriken require their own weapon proficiency, which is not related
to any other. Weapon specialization confers the usual benefits. To learn
shuriken proficiency, one must study with someone who has it, and must have a weapon
proficiency slot to spend.
<P></P>
Shuriken are available in oriental ports, but most occidental collectors don't
know how to use them.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Tetsubo</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
The tetsubo is a long walking-staff, its upper end shod with studded iron
strips.
<P></P>
Its weapon proficiency is related to other polearms; specialization confers
the usual benefits.
<P></P>
Tetsubos can be had in oriental markets, but none are exported because it is a
relatively simple weapon to make.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Wakizashi
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The wakizashi is the short-sword companion of the katana. Its blade is forged
the same way, and the weapon looks like a shorter version of the katana. It is
often part of a matched set with the katana, and is of almost equal importance
as the katana to the samurai. Only samurai can wear both katana and wakizashi.
<P></P>
Wakizashi proficiency is related to short sword. Specialization confers the
usual benefits. Many samurai fight with the katana in one hand and wakizashi in
the other, in two-weapon technique, and some learn the two-weapon style
specialization to further improve their ability with this style.
<P></P>
Wakizashis are as hard to come by as katanas.
<P></P>
<P></P>

<P></P>

<P></P>
The<I> AD&amp;D®</I> game supplement<I> Oriental Adventures</I> describes many, many other weapons and provides a lot of resource material
for oriental characters and campaigns. A certain amount of conversion is
required, as the supplement was written for the first-edition game.
