</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Teams of four Man-sized creatures can inflict 1d2 points of structural damage
each round if armed with picks, crowbars, or weapons that can serve as picks or
crowbars. Teams of less than four creatures also can inflict structural
damage, but there is a one-round delay for every creature missing. For example, a
team of three humans could inflict 1d2 points of structural damage every two
rounds. Sapping is a no-move action that occupies a creature for the entire round.
<P></P>
Two Small or four Tiny creatures count as one Man-sized sapper; one Large
creature counts as two Man-sized sappers, one Huge creature counts as three
Man-sized sappers, and so on. Burrowing creatures inflict triple damage dice. For
example, a single umber hulk (a Large burrowing creature) inflicts 3d2 points of
damage every two rounds.
