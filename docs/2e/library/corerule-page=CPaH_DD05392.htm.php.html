<FONT SIZE="4"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Violations and Penalties</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; When a paladin violates his
ethos&#151;that is, when he violates any stricture, virtue, or edict
he has sworn to uphold&#151;he suffers a penalty. This penalty is in
addition to any punishments required by applicable laws or local
customs. For instance, if a paladin robs a merchant, he suffers an
ethos penalty <I>and</I> he may also be imprisoned.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Two methods are provided for determining
ethos violations and penalties. The Standard Method, derived from a
strict reading of the <I>Player's Handbook</I> rules, is the easiest
to referee, but generates the harshest penalties. The Alternative
Method is easier on the players, but requires more effort from the
DM. Whichever method you prefer, it's best to stick with it
throughout the entire campaign.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; In all cases, the DM has the final word
on whether a violation has occurred. At the DM's discretion, he may
allow the paladin to appeal his decision. If the paladin argues
convincingly that his actions didn't violate his ethos, the DM may
suspend the penalty.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If the paladin's violation isn't
especially severe, the DM has the option of letting him off with a
warning. If the paladin picks up a new magical item and already has
10, the DM might remind him of the relevant stricture, giving him the
chance to put the item down before he claims ownership. One warning,
however, is plenty; if the paladin commits the same act a second
time, a penalty should be applied immediately.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The DM may bypass both the Standard and
Alternate Methods, instead considering each ethos violation on its
own merits and assessing any penalty that seems appropriate. A
willful and deliberate evil action results in the irrevocable loss of
the paladin's status. Lesser violations should result in minor
penalties, such as the temporary loss of one or more of the paladin's
abilities. A suitable quest, the clerical <I>atonement</I> spell, or
both may be used as penance for lesser violations.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Standard Method</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; This method weighs the severity of an
ethos violation purely in terms of alignment. The DM decides if a
violation is chaotic or evil, and then applies the appropriate penalty.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Chaotic Violations</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Chaotic acts include violations that are
inadvertent, impulsive, and relatively benign. The violation cannot
have directly or indirectly resulted in physical harm to any non-evil
person. Examples:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; A moment of panic.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Opposing the judgment of officials from his
government or church. If the paladin refuses a just edict, the
violation becomes evil.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Failure to display proper courtesy to an elder
or peer.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Arrogance.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Telling a &quot;white lie&quot; or couching the
truth. If the lie results in harm to another person, the violation
become evil.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Penalty: </B>If a paladin knowingly 
commits any chaotic violation of his ethos, he must seek out a lawful
good cleric of 9th level or higher. A cleric of the paladin's faith
is preferable but not mandatory. The paladin must locate the cleric
as soon as possible. An undue delay&#151;say, of more than a few
weeks&#151;changes the violation to an evil one.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the paladin locates a cleric, he
must make a full confession of his transgression and ask for
forgiveness. The cleric will prescribe an appropriate penance. The
paladin must execute the penance immediately; failure to do so
constitutes a further violation. Typical penance's include:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; 1-4 weeks laboring at a monastery or church.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; A day or two in complete isolation, where the
paladin does nothing but contemplate the wrongness of his action.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Completion of a modest task (such as retrieving
a medicinal herb from a mountain top or ridding the monastery
basement of a snake infestation).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Evil Violations</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Evil violations include intentional acts
of theft, treason, cowardice, betrayal, greed, cheating, and
blasphemy. Any ethos violation resulting in deliberate physical harm
to a lawful good character is considered evil.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Penalty:</B> Even a single evil
violation results in the immediate and irrevocable loss of the
paladin's status. He forfeits all benefits, powers, and privileges
associated with the paladin class, none of which may be restored by
magic or any other means. From that point on, the character exists as
a fighter; he keeps the same level and adjusts his experience points
as necessary. Because he wasn't a fighter at the beginning of his
career, he isn't eligible for weapon specialization.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Magically Influenced Actions</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The DM may excuse chaotic acts performed
by an enchanted or magically controlled paladin. Optionally, he may
impose a small penalty, such as those in &quot;Self-Administered
Penalties,&quot; on p. 43.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If a paladin commits an evil act while
enchanted or controlled by magic, he immediately loses his paladin
status and becomes a fighter as described above. However, because the
evil act wasn't intentional, the status loss is temporary. To regain
his status, the character must complete a dangerous quest or
important mission on behalf of his government, church, or mentor.
Possibilities include recovering an artifact in another plane of
existence, accumulating enough treasure to build a spectacular
monastery, or singlehandedly slaying an evil dragon. The character
acquires no experience points as long as he remains a fighter. If the
character completes his mission, he becomes a paladin again. He has
the same level and number of experience points that he did when he
lost his status.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A character who doesn't wish to undertake
such a grueling mission may abandon his paladinhood altogether and
remain a fighter. From that point on, he acquires experience points
and attains new levels the same as any other fighter. Once he
abandons his paladinhood, he may never regain it.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Alternate Method</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; This method gives the DM more latitude in
determining the severity of ethos violations and also allows for a
variety of penalties. To determine the severity of a violation, the
DM must consider the paladin's intention, the consequences of the
action, and who is affected.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Ethos violations fall into four general
categories of increasing severity. Categories 1 and 2 include minor
violations affecting non-evil characters other than the paladin's
peers and superiors. Most violations belonging to Categories 1 and 2
are thoughtless, selfish, and insensitive actions which may not be
evil in a strict sense. Deliberate or unambiguously evil actions
belong in Categories 3 and 4. Additionally, <I>all</I> ethos
violations involving an official of the paladin's government or
church, or any organization or person to whom he's pledged fealty,
belong to Category 3 or 4.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; As these categories are necessarily
broad, each includes several examples to help the DM make his
decisions. Several possible penalties are also given. The DM should
choose a penalty that fits the crime. He's also free to make up his
own penalties based on these samples.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Category 1: Incidental Violations</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; This category includes accidental,
inadvertent, and careless violations with insignificant consequences.
The paladin doesn't benefit from this type of violation in any way.
Nor do these violations jeopardize the safety of any non-evil person,
either directly or indirectly. Examples include:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Hesitating before entering a dark room. If the
paladin is too fearful to enter at all, this becomes at least at
Category 2 violation (higher, if his reluctance results in harm to a companion).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Failing to return a friendly stranger's
greeting. If the paladin's indiscretion is due to arrogance rather
than a simple mistake, this becomes a Category 2 violation. Likewise,
this belongs to Category 2 if the stranger takes offense.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Brushing against a stranger's dinner table and
knocking a pitcher of ale into his lap.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Sample penalties include:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Apologize to anyone slighted by his actions, as
well as to anyone observing the indiscretion.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Champion the slighted person in an upcoming tournament.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Meditate for an hour each night for the next
1-2 weeks, contemplating the wrongness of the action.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Category 2: Grave Violations</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; This category includes serious violations
of trust and judgment, including accidental or careless acts that
might jeopardize the safety of non-evil characters. It also includes
intentional acts that offend, disappoint, or mislead non-evil
characters, but don't jeopardize their safety. (Intentional acts that
jeopardize the safety of others belong to Category 3). Examples include:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Failing to keep armor or weapons in optimum condition.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Neglecting personal hygiene.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Lying to a vendor about the quality of his
merchandise. If the paladin lies to take advantage of the
vendor&#151;for instance, to make the vendor more cooperative or to
get a better price&#151;this becomes a Category 3 violation.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Lose or misplace a small trinket carried for a companion.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Sample penalties include:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Seek out a high-level lawful good cleric and
complete a penance (as described in the &quot;Chaotic Violations''
section above).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Forfeit a small sum to a charity (perhaps 2d10
gp or a day of work).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Pay double or triple all tithes for the next
1d4 months.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Temporarily lose the ability to cast spells,
detect the presence of evil, remain immune to disease, radiate an
aura of protection, or cure diseases. The loss persists for 1d4 weeks.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Earn only half of the normal number of
experience points for the next 1-10 weeks.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Category 3: Extreme Violations</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; This category covers acts that call into
question the paladin's commitment to his ethos, such as intentional
acts that jeopardize the safety of non-evil characters. Examples include:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Delaying the execution of an edict, or failing
to satisfactorily complete an edict.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Informing travelers that the road ahead is
safe, declining to mention the rumors of bandits.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Inadvertently inflicting great harm on the
patron's cause, such as failure to protect an artifact or important official.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Avarice, usury, or preoccupation with worldly goods.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Failing to aid a dying person.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Panicking and retreating from a battle.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Sample penalties include:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Forfeit his stronghold and all other property holdings.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Permanently lose the ability to cast spells (or
the spells of a particular sphere) until appropriate atonement is made.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Permanently lose one of the following
abilities: detect presence of evil, disease immunity, aura of
protection, or laying on hands to cure disease until appropriate
atonement is made.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; The bonded mount leaves, never to return. The
paladin never acquires a replacement.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Category 4: Execrable Violations</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; This category includes the most
intolerable and unforgivable ethos violations, the worst deeds a
paladin can commit. Any direct violation of a stricture or edict
belongs here, as do violations that result in physical harm to any
lawful good character. This category also includes any violation
affecting an official of the paladin's government or church. Examples include:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Refusing or ignoring a just edict.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Habitual cowardice.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Committing an act of blasphemy.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Betrayal of the patron.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Concealing funds, hoarding more than 10 magical
items, or purposely neglecting to tithe.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; There is but one penalty here:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; The paladin immediately loses his status, as
described in the &quot;Evil Violations'' section above. Heinous
crimes against the monarch may merit execution. Crimes against the
church may result in a vengeful deity striking the paladin dead with
a lightning bolt or causing the earth to swallow him up. (If in
doubt, roll 1d20. On a roll of 1, the deity kills the blasphemous
paladin; otherwise he is just subject to institutional penalties.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Magically Influenced Actions</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If paladin commits an evil act while
enchanted or controlled by magic or psionics, the DM determines the
category of the violation, then applies a penalty from Table 15.</FONT></P>

</TABLE></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Ceremony of Disgrace</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; At the DM's option, a paladin guilty of
an ethos violation may have to submit to a Ceremony of Disgrace in
addition to a penalty. Usually, Ceremonies of Disgrace accompany
punishments for heinous crimes involving government or church
officials (defined as &quot;Evil Violations&quot; in the Standard
Method, and Category 3 and 4 Violations in the Alternate Method), but
they may be used for lesser violations as well.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A typical Ceremony of Disgrace requires
the guilty paladin to appear before one or more representatives of
his government or church. The more serious the crime, the higher the
station of the presiding official; a low-level bureaucrat may suffice
for a Category 2 violation, but the king himself may choose to
oversee the ceremony for a Category 4 violation. To compound the
paladin's shame, a Ceremony of Disgrace is often held before an
audience in the town square or other public forum with the accused
paladin standing on a raised platform for all to see.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The ceremony begins with the presiding
official declaring the paladin's crime. The official chastises the
paladin for betraying his Code of Ennoblement, then announces the
penalty. For a minor violation, the paladin may ask for one of the
paladin's non-magical weapons. The official destroys the weapon by
throwing it into a fire or snapping off the blade.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; For a heinous violation, more elaborate
humiliations may be involved. In addition to destroying one of the
paladin's weapons, the official may demand that the paladin hand over
each piece of his armor. The official flings each piece into a fire
or has an aide pound the pieces with a mallet, rendering them
useless. The official may then slap the paladin's face, douse him
with a bucket of offal, or roughly shear the hair from his head until
only a stubble remains. Finally, the official strips the paladin of
his name; the paladin must call himself by a new name from that point on.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the ceremony, the paladin must
remain silent. Speaking during a Ceremony of Disgrace may be
considered an ethos violation in itself, requiring an additional penalty.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Self-Administered Penalties</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Occasionally, a paladin may commit an
ethos violation that the DM considers irrelevant. The paladin might
think lustful thoughts about an attractive hireling, mutter an insult
under his breath about a hated foe, or accidentally eat a soup
containing chicken broth when he's vowed to be vegetarian. While all
of these examples might technically be ethos violations, they're so
trivial that the DM will probably overlook them (assuming he's aware
of them in the first place).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; But even when the DM overlooks a trivial
violation, a truly conscientious paladin player may insist on a
penalty anyway. In such cases, the paladin is free to punish himself
and choose his own penalty; the DM may veto a penalty he deems too
severe. Typical self-imposed penalties might include:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Apologies to the affected parties, with
assurances the offensive act will never be committed again.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; A vow of silence for the next 1-2 days.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Becoming consumed with guilt and self-loathing
for the next 1-2 days, during which time he makes all combat rolls
and ability checks at a &#150;1 penalty.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; A special tithing, donation, or service for
which the paladin accepts no return.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Anti-Paladins</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; What better nemesis for a paladin than
his direct opposite, an &quot;anti-paladin&quot; that embodies the
forces of evil? As the mirror image of a normal paladin, an
anti-paladin might be able to detect the presence of good, generate a
aura of protection against good creatures, and wield an
&quot;unholy&quot; sword.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Though DMs may experiment with any type
of character they like, we discourage the use of anti-paladins. Good
and evil are not merely mirror images of each other. Just as the
forces of evil have their unique champions, the paladin is intended
as a unique champion of good. The paladin originates from a tradition
of dynamic balance, in which the forces of good are few and elite and
in which forces of evil are numerous and of lesser quality. Allowing
anti-paladins blurs this basic relationship.</FONT></P>
