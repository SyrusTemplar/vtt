<P></P>
The python strikes as a +2 magical weapon and inflicts 1d6+2 points of damage
when it hits. If the priest throws the staff to the ground, it grows from its
6-foot length, becoming a constrictor snake, 25 feet long (AC 3, 49 hit points,
movement rate of 9). This happens in one round. The snake will entwine if it
scores a hit, the opponent being constricted for 2d4+2 points of damage per
round. The victim will remain trapped by the python until he dies or the creature is
destroyed. Note that the python will return to its owner upon command. If it
is destroyed while in snake form, the staff is destroyed.
<P></P>
The adder strikes as a +1 magical weapon and does 2d2 points of damage when it
hits. Upon command the head of the staff becomes that of an actual serpent (AC
5, 20 hit points). This head remains for one full turn. When a hit is scored,
damage is not increased, but the victim must roll a successful saving throw vs.
poison (strength E) or be slain. Only evil priests will employ an adder staff.
If the snake head is killed, the staff is destroyed.
<P></P>
Neither staff has nor requires charges. Most of these staves—60%—are pythons.
