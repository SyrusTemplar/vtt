   A holy sword is a special type of consecrated weapon that provides a paladin
with unique benefits. Though the <I>sword +5, Holy Avenger</I> (described in the Appendix of the <I>DMG</I>) is one of the more common examples, others exist as well. A few are
described in Chapter 6 of this book.
<P></P>
   Aside from their exceptional craftsmanship, holy swords are often
indistinguishable from ordinary magical weapons. A paladin may not become aware of the
sword's special powers until he uses it. In some cases, a paladin may be able to
identify a holy sword by its cryptic inscription (which may require the Ancient
Languages proficiency or a friendly mage's <I>read magic</I> spell to translate). A skilled weaponsmith or sage may also recognize a holy
sword. Occasionally, a holy sword will glow when touched by a paladin, or the
paladin's arm may tingle when he picks it up.
<P></P>
   Holy swords are hard to come by, and a paladin rarely finds more than one in
his entire career. Usually, a paladin acquires a holy sword under difficult or
extraordinary circumstances. A holy sword may be part of a venerable red
dragon's treasure horde, concealed in a cave atop a high mountain. A paladin may hear
rumors of a holy sword buried in a desert ruins; in fact, the ruins contain a
map that shows the actual location of the holy sword, embedded in a glacier in
an arctic wilderness. If a paladin reaches a high level without acquiring a holy
sword, his deity might direct him to one in a temple on the ocean floor or a
treasure chest on a remote island. In any case, the DM should treat the
acquisition of a holy sword as a significant campaign event, and design the
circumstances of its discovery accordingly.
<P></P>
   When unsheathed and held by a paladin, every holy sword projects a <I>circle of power</I> 10 feet in diameter. The paladin's hand serves as the center of the circle.
The circle moves with the paladin and persists as long as he grips the sword.
The sword projects the circle even if a glove, gauntlet, or bandage covers the
paladin's hand.
<P></P>
   <B>Note:</B> The first sentence in the paragraph regarding the paladin's holy sword in
Chapter 3 of the PH (<A HREF="PHB_DD01464.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01464.htm">page 27</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">) should read: &quot;A paladin using a <I>holy sword</I> projects a circle of power 10 feet in diameter when the sword is unsheathed
and held.&quot;
<P></P>
   Within its range, the circle of power dispels all hostile magic of a level
less than or equal to the paladin's experience level and creates a magic
resistance of 50%. Specifically:
<P></P>
• All evil opponents within the circle are unable to cast spells, including
monsters and characters of evil alignment; extraplanar, conjured, and summoned
evil entities; and monsters and characters who have been charmed or controlled by
evil casters. The circle neutralizes a spell the instant it's cast. Opponents
may not make saving throws to resist the circle of power.
<P></P>
• Evil opponents have normal use of their spell and spell-like abilities once
they leave the range of the circle. However, the paladin remains immune to their spells, even when cast from outside the
circle. An evil wizard can cast a <I>fireball</I> spell at a paladin, but the <I>fireball</I> dissipates as soon as it enters the circle. An evil spellcaster's attempts to
mentally probe or control a paladin (with spells such as <I>ESP</I> and<I> magic jar</I>) will also fail.
<P></P>
• Magical items created by evil magic won't work within the circle. Physical
properties remain unchanged, however; a <I>sword +1 </I>may still be wielded as a normal sword. Outside the circle, magical items
function normally, but the paladin remains immune to their effects.
<P></P>
  The following restrictions also apply:
<P></P>
• The paladin is always vulnerable to magic from opponents whose level exceeds
his own. The paladin has the normal chances of avoiding the affects of these
magical attacks.
<P></P>
• The circle functions only as long as the paladin grips the holy sword.
Should he sheathe or drop it, he immediately becomes vulnerable to evil magic.
<P></P>
• The paladin must be conscious and in control of his own actions for the holy
sword to project a circle of power. A holy sword doesn't dispel magic in the
grip of a comatose or sleeping paladin.
<P></P>
• An evil spellcaster may temporarily negate the magic of a holy sword,
including its power to project a circle of protection, by casting <I>dispel magic</I> directly on the weapon. The holy sword may resist the spell with a successful
saving throw vs. spell, using the paladin's saving-throw number. If the throw
fails, the holy sword's magic is inert for 1-4 rounds.
<P></P>
• A paladin is still subject to indirect effects of evil magic. If an evil
spellcaster uses a <I>lighting bolt</I> spell to cause an avalanche, the paladin risks damage from falling boulders.
<P></P>
   Certain holy swords may have additional benefits and limitations. A <I>Holy Avenger</I>, for instance, inflicts +10 points of damage on chaotic evil opponents. Each
holy sword described in Chapter 6 has its own special properties. In designing
holy swords, the DM may use the standard benefits and limits described above,
perhaps adding a +1 to +5 bonus on attack and damage rolls against certain kinds
of evil opponents.
