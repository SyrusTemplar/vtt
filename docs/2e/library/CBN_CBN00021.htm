<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="NAVY"><B>Philosopher</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The Philosopher studies necromancy out of an
overpowering desire to master the forbidden and secret arts shunned
by the rest of world. Indeed, if necromancy were not publicly reviled
or a topic of social taboo, the Philosopher would not give this
school of magic more than a cursory thought. The Philosopher is
curious about the forbidden, fascinated by the obscure. The Black
Arts are especially tempting to this wizard, who craves to unravel
all the dark, hidden mysteries of the universe.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The Philosopher is a theoretician, not an experimenter
like the Anatomist. Instead, this wizard gains almost all knowledge
from the ancient (often banned) books, scrolls, and magical spells at
his or her disposal. When trying to resolve a particularly knotty
problem, the wizard may correspond with other Philosophers or summon
an agent from the lower planes for interrogation. Knowledge and
understanding are always the foremost goals of this kit.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Numerous examples of this kit can be found in the
short stories of H. P. Lovecraft and his literary successors, for
whom this character became something of a stereotype. Lovecraft was
noted for creating the fictional <I>Necronomicon</I>, a book of black
necromancy and baneful summonings supposedly written by the Mad Arab,
Abdul Alhazred, an insane wizard who delved too deeply into his
forbidden researches. Many horror writers have expanded on
Lovecraft&#146;s notion of the demented scholar or sage (see
&#147;Return of the Sorcerer&#148; and &#147;Ubbo-Sathla&#148; by
Clark Ashton Smith, &#147;The Dweller in Darkness&#148; and
&#147;Beyond the Threshold&#148; by August Derlith, &#147;Shambler
from the Stars&#148; and &#147;The Shadow from the Steeple&#148; by
Robert Bloch, &#147;The Terror from the Depths&#148; by Fritz Leiber,
and &#147;Rising with Surtsey&#148; by Brian Lumley). The DM should
have little difficulty locating source material for this type of necromancer.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Requirements:</B> Because of their fascination with
the darker side of necromancy, Philosophers may only be of any
neutral, non-good alignment (only N, CN, LN, or NE). A Philosopher
must have a minimum 14 Int, besides the usual minimum 16 Wis.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Spell Preferences:</B> This wizard favors spells
from the spheres of necromancy (all categories), conjuration/summoning,
and divination. During their research, they have little use for
alteration or invocation spells.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Role:</B> The Philosopher is a demented and outcast
scholar, forced to pursue his or her dangerous studies on the fringes
of civilization. This wizard lives like a recluse, always residing in
the outskirts of town or in the wilderness. The Philosopher&#146;s
sinister habits and fiendish summonings would repulse the
uninitiated, inflame neighbors, and quickly bring an eviction by the
local authorities. It is far easier to live alone, attended by a few
trusted henchmen or familiars who respect and occasionally assist in
the work.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">This wizard is not prone to adventuring and rarely
leaves the library, except when lured by the prospect of gaining
ancient books, necromantic scrolls, or magical items for study.
Except for seeking out these new arcane materials, the Philosopher
remains almost always at home. The most fanatical scholars set up a
bed in a corner of their library so they may work on their research
during all waking hours.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The most probable role of this character in the
campaign will be that of an NPC sage or scholar who must be contacted
by the party during the course of a quest or adventure. Kazerabet,
for instance, is a reclusive Philosopher with a passion for ancient
history. Her NPC sheet appears in Chapter Nine. The famous author of
the <I>Art of Necromancy</I>, her work has been quoted in the
Introduction and the final chapter of this book. In the campaign of
the <FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="CBN00157.htm">Isle of the
Necromancer Kings</A></FONT> (see Chapter Nine), she serves as a
neutral source of antique lore for the adventurers, providing them
with background information for the adventure. Locating the
Philosopher, intruding on her realm, and obtaining the desired
knowledge should prove to be an opportunity for lively role-playing,
given the eccentricities of the kit.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> A Philosopher like
Kazerabet has little experience or need for weapons, relying almost
exclusively on her wits or spells during an encounter. The wizard may
only choose small weapons that can easily be learned indoors (the
dagger, dart, or knife).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Required: netherworld
knowledge, reading/writing. Recommended: (General) artistic ability,
etiquette, heraldry, languages (modern); (Priest) local history;
(Wizard) ancient history, astrology, herbalism, languages (ancient),
necrology, religion, spellcraft, spirit lore. Forbidden: all Rogue
and Warrior.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Equipment:</B> This wizard has little or no concern
for physical appearance or personal possessions (unless magical, of
course). As a result, the Philosopher will typically be poorly
equipped, wearing unkempt and unfashionable clothing, and carrying
little besides spell components and a small weapon. Of course,
Kazerabet is an exception to this generality because of her past
history as a former queen.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Special Benefits:</B> The Philosopher has the
knowledge of a sage regarding spells in the school of Necromancy,
necromantic magical items, and the netherworld (particularly the
Lower Planes). When questioned on this topic, the wizard has a base
5% chance per level of immediately knowing the answer, as if he or
she had cast <I>legend lore</I>. As with the 6th-level spell, the DM
must decide on the specific nature of any details learned by this
ability. Since most of the Philosopher&#146;s knowledge will be based
on the partly coherent ramblings of partially demented necromancers
(like him- or herself), there is little to assure that the answer to
any specific question will be meaningful or even comprehensible. If
the wizard does not directly know the answer to a typical question,
the Philosopher is constrained by the typical rules for the <A HREF="DMG_DD00575.htm">sage</A>,
outlined on pages 106&#150;108 in the <I>DMG</I>.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">If the DM allows psionics in the campaign, the
Philosopher may possess one or more <FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="CBN00038.htm">wild
talents</A></FONT> (see Chapter Two for more on this). These unusual
psychic abilities result from the wizard&#146;s peripheral researches
on the hidden powers of the human mind, an interesting subtopic of
necromancy (see the 4th-level spell<I> <A HREF="CBN00100.htm">brainkill</A></I>
in Chapter Four). The Philosopher&#146;s unique mental powers will
certainly complement his or her demented or slightly insane nature
(see below).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Along with the usual benefits of the specialist, the
Philosopher gains a +30% chance (total) when learning spells from the
school of Necromancy. Unlike most other necromantic kits, this wizard
devotes considerable time to magical research and thus is likely to
have a very large repertoire of (mostly necromantic) spells at his or
her disposal.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Special Hindrances:</B> Perhaps the greatest
hindrance of this character is a tenuous grasp on reality. Normally,
scholars attempt to retain an objective or unbiased view of their
research. With black necromancy, however, such an emotionless and
impartial perspective is extremely difficult to maintain. Because of
the internal contradictions involved, spurred by tamperings with
extraplanar forces beyond mortal reckoning, a Philosopher like
Kazerabet sometimes loses a sane perspective on the normal world
around her. Her attitude about life is somewhat distorted by the
terrible secrets she has learned, and the cumulative burden of these
inexplicable mysteries can be unbearable.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Not surprisingly, Philosophers may become <FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="CBN00078.htm">insane</A></FONT>
(see Chapter Three), though rarely in a manner that impedes their
scholarly research. Even the mighty Kazerabet is not without her
paranoia and her irrational need for privacy (although these are
possibly not bad traits for a necromancer).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Finally, because of the wizard&#146;s extensive
research in necromancy, spells from other schools are much more
difficult to learn for the Philosopher, resulting in a &#150;30%
penalty. Otherwise, the Philosopher has the usual restrictions
regarding forbidden schools and magical items.</FONT></P>
