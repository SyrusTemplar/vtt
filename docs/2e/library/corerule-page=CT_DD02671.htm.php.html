The brawling procedures make extensive use of opposed rolls. See <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02480.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02480.htm.php.html">Chapter Two</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> for a discussion of how to use opposed rolls in combat. Note that in an
opposed ability check a die roll of 20 is always a failure, even if the effective
score is 20 or more. In an opposed attack roll, a die roll of 1 is always a
failure, even if adjustments to the roll would allow for success.
