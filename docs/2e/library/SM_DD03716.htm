This mighty spell summons a tsunami, or gigantic wave, from any major body of
water. The body of water must be at least 1 mile in width, so in most
circumstances the <I>tsunami </I>can only be summoned from the sea, large lakes, or extremely big rivers. The
wave is 2 feet high and 10 feet long for each level of experience of the caster,
so a 15th-level priest would summon a <I>tsunami </I>30 feet high and 150 feet wide. The wave can appear anywhere within the
spell's range and immediately sweeps forward in the direction specified by the
caster. This may take it out of the allowed range or even back at the casting priest.
The <I>tsunami </I>moves at a rate of 24 (240 yards per round) and lasts one round at 14th level,
two rounds at 18th level, or three rounds at 22nd or higher level.
<P></P>
Ships caught by the <I>tsunami </I>must make a seaworthiness check (see <A HREF="DMG_DD00645.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00645.htm">Table 77</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Ship Types in the <I>DMG</I>) with a penalty equal to the wave's height in feet. For example, a <I>tsunami </I>created by a 15th-level caster would inflict a ?30% penalty to a vessel-s
seaworthiness check. If the check is failed, the vessel capsizes and sinks in 1d10
rounds, with the possible loss of those aboard. Human or humanoid swimmers
caught in the wave must make a saving throw vs. death magic or be drowned in the
wave; any creature in the water in the wave's path will be carried along as long
as it lasts.
<P></P>
If the priest sent the wave towards the shore, the <I>tsunami </I>loses 5 feet of height for every 20 yards it travels; a 30-foot wave could
wash 120 yards inland before there was nothing left of it. Creatures caught in the
area sustain 1d4 points of damage for every 5 feet of height the <I>tsunami </I>currently possesses and are carried along until it ends. Air-breathing
creatures must make saving throws vs. death magic or be drowned outright by this
treatment. Wooden buildings have a chance equal to three times the wave's current
height of being destroyed by the <I>tsunami </I>(90% for a 30-foot wave, for example) while stone buildings have a chance
equal to the wave's height (or 30% for a 30-foot wave). Topography may influence or
channel the wave's advance, so a good-sized hill could stop a tsunami cold,
although its seaward face may be denuded of creatures and vegetation by the wave.
<P></P>
Note that this spell in the hands of a high-level character can blanket an
awesome amount of territory and literally destroy or drown anything in its path.
The <I>tsunami </I>is so strenuous a spell that the priest is exhausted and helpless for 1d6
hours after summoning it.
