<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B> Mining:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A character with mining proficiency is needed to site and supervise the
operations of any mine. First, the character can attempt to determine what types of
ores or gems can be found in a given area. To do this, he must spend at least a
week searching a four-square-mile area. The DM may rule that more area must be
searched to find anything of value and may thus increase the amount of time
required. At the end of the search, the character can say what is likely to be
found in this area. After this, the character can site the mine. On a successful
proficiency check (made secretly by the DM), the character has found a good site
to begin mining for any minerals that may be in the area. The check does not
guarantee a successful mine, only that a particular site is the best choice in a
given area. The DM must determine what minerals, if any, are to be found in
the region of the mine. On a failed check, the character only thinks he has found
a good site. Much effort is spent before the character is proved wrong, of
course.

Once the mine is in operation, a character with mining proficiency must remain
on site to supervise all work. Although this is a steady job, most player
characters will find it better to hire an NPC for this purpose.
