<A NAME="359cba9b"></A><FONT SIZE="3"><B>Scarab of Uncertainty:</B> This scarab has a specific and potentially powerful effect. If the wearer is
within range of a <I>monster summoning</I> or similar spell (<I>invisible stalker, conjure animals</I>, etc.) when cast by another creature or character, the summoned creatures
make a saving throw versus spell the instant they appear. If the summoned
creatures fail this saving throw, they mistakenly believe that the wearer of the scarab
is the individual who summoned them and will then serve the scarab wearer as
best they can, rather than the caster of the spell.
