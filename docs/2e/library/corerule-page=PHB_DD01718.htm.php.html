<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Unlike standard missiles, which target a specific creature, a grenade-like
missile is aimed at a point, whether this point is a creature or a spot on the
ground. When the attack is announced, the player indicates where he wants the
missile to land. This then becomes the target point and is used to determine the
direction and distance of any scatter.
<P></P>
Most grenade-like missiles are items of opportunity or necessity--rocks,
flasks of oil, vials of holy water, or beakers of acid. As such, these items are not
listed on the equipment tables for range, ROF, and damage. The range each can
be thrown varies with the Strength of the character and the weight of the
object.
<P></P>
A missile of five pounds or less can be thrown about 30 feet. Short range is
10 feet, medium range is 20 feet, and everything beyond is maximum range.
Heavier items have reduced ranges. Just how far an object can be thrown is decided by
the DM.
<P></P>
Exceptionally heavy items can be thrown only if the character rolls a
successful bend bars/lift gates check. In no case can a character throw an item heavier
than his Strength would allow him to lift. Thus, the DM can rule that a
character would have little trouble chucking a half-empty backpack across a ten-foot
chasm, but the character would need to make a check in order to heave an orc
ten feet through the air into the faces of his orcish friends.
<P></P>
Once a container hits, it normally breaks immediately. However, this is not
always true. Some missiles, like soft leather flasks or hard pottery, are
particularly resistant. If there's some doubt about whether or not a thrown object
will break, the DM can require an item saving throw (this information is in the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00330.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00330.htm.php.html">DMG</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">) to see if it shatters or rips, spewing its contents everywhere.
