Halfling fighters have been known to form strong friendships with fighters,
rangers, and paladins of other races--most notably human, but not disallowing
dwarven, elven, and other more exotic folk (one chaotic evil halfling is said to
have formed a partnership with a red dragon!). Since such adventuring pairs
typically encounter most of their excitement in nonhalfling societies, the halfling
partner is often regarded (by the members of that other society) as an
apprentice, squire, or sidekick to the warrior of local origin. Such an assumption,
naturally, is very far from the truth; the two are in fact full partners.
<P></P>
However, the halfling warrior does serve a number of useful functions that
would prove difficult for the larger partner to accomplish on his or her own.
Squires make marvelous scouts and spies, since they specialize in acting dumb and
nonthreatening.
<P></P>
The size of the halfling, together with the ability to hide in bushes and
undergrowth, makes him or her an exceptionally valuable companion when it comes to
gathering information. It's even possible for a Squire to disguise himself or
herself as a human child to gain access to places where adult adventurers fear
to tread.
<P></P>
The Squire needs two minimum attribute score: a 10 for Strength and a 12 for
Charisma.
<P></P>
Roads to Adventure: For the Squire, friendship is a strong enough inducement
to draw him or her away from the typical halfling comforts. In this case,
anything that compels the first member of the pair will draw the halfling character
along as well.
<P></P>
The Squire is often motivated by genuine friendship for his or her partner,
sometimes coupled with a sense of gratitude for something that has happened in
the past, or a mutual goal (perhaps even a quest) that the pair have embarked
upon together.
<P></P>
Role: When among strangers, the halfling Squire often plays the role of
simpleminded servant; this increases his or her chances to eavesdrop and usually
causes potential enemies to underestimate the danger he or she poses. All Squires
are adept at observing nearly everything that goes on around them and often act
as ambassadors to other races--particularly those who might be hostile to the
Squire's partner.
<P></P>
It is important to realize that, in reality, the Squire and his partner are
full equals--the halfling is not a squire in the traditional sense of apprentice
or servant. Even if the two act out a false relationship for appearances' sake,
the Squire and his partner remain together because of trust and affection;
there is no room for one or the other to be the boss.
<P></P>
Secondary Skills: A Squire should have the Groom secondary skill.
<P></P>
Weapon Proficiencies: This character should have a proficiency in at least one
melee and one missile weapon. A proficiency that matches his or her partner's
can provide extra benefits (see Special Benefits, below).
<P></P>
Bonus Nonweapon Proficiencies: The Squire character receives either the Animal
Handling or the Riding (Landbased) proficiency as a bonus. In addition, the
halfling can gain proficiencies known to his or her partners, simply through the
progress of their cooperative adventures, as follows:
<P></P>
When the halfling goes up in level and at least half the necessary experience
points to gain the new level were earned from tasks that the Squire performed
with his or her partner, the halfling can add one proficiency slot, filling it
with a proficiency that his or her partner holds and used during the course of
the previous adventures.
<P></P>
Recommended Nonweapon Proficiencies: Heraldry and Foreign Languages are
proficiencies that often prove useful in a Squire; also, the Armorer,
Bowyer/Fletcher, and Weaponsmithing skills can be helpful.
<P></P>
Equipment: A Squire's companion will try to provide a suitable steed for his
or her partner, as well as weapons and armor for the halfling, if he or she has
the means.
<P></P>
Special Benefits: The Squire becomes very familiar with the habits and
characteristics of his or her partner's race; thus, he or she gains a +2 bonus to NPC
Reaction Rolls made for members of that race.
<P></P>
In addition, the Squire can advance to slightly higher levels than can other
halfling warriors. The Squire can reach a total of two levels higher than he or
she would otherwise be allowed (see page 92); however, he or she cannot pass
the level of his or her partner by this means.
<P></P>
Special Hindrances: The loss is mostly intangible, but the halfling Squire is
forced to do without the comforts of hearth and burrow that are so fundamental
to his or her kind. In effect, he or she chooses to replace his or her family
with the partner; a Squire who loses that partner to death or other mischance is
a lonely halfling indeed.
