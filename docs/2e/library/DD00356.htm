If the spell seems unacceptable, tell the player what the concerns are.
Usually, an agreement can be reached on any problems.
<P></P>
However, if there don't seem to be any problems with the spell, the next step
can begin.
<P></P>
Never immediately approve a spell when it is first presented. Take the spell
description and consider all the ways it could be abused. If some glaring misuse
becomes apparent, fix the spell so this cannot happen. Keep doing this until
all the obvious problems and abuses have been fixed. The player should then have
a chance to look at all the changes in his spell. After all, once the DM has
finished with it, the player may no longer want to research it.
<P></P>
After the player and DM have agreed on the description of the spell, the DM
must decide the level of the spell, its components, research time, and research
cost.
