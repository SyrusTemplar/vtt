The Sphere of War involves magic specifically for use on the battlefield--in
mass combat between large units. Usually, these spells are granted by deities of
war: those Powers who believe that victory and courage in battle are the
ultimate goals for mortals.
<P></P>
Priests who follow these gods are sometimes generals or leaders of armies. For
these priests, tactical and strategic brilliance are as important as personal
skill in combat.
<P></P>
There are significant differences between the spheres of War and Combat.
Combat spells are those the priest can use in personal altercations. These spells
inflict physical damage on an opponent or improve the combat abilities of the
priest and several comrades. War spells, on the other hand, are concerned with
aspects of large-scale battles other than direct infliction of damage:
observation, identification, movement, morale, and the like. Few spells of this sphere
inflict physical damage on the enemy.
<P></P>
Unlike spells of other spheres, most War spells can be cast only on a single
military &quot;unit.&quot; The definition of a &quot;unit&quot; is that which is used in the
BATTLESYSTEM™ rules; however, the DM may rule that any large group of troops
accompanied by PCS may qualify as a unit. Units can be infantry or cavalry (ground or
airborne), human or non-human, of regular or irregular formation. In general,
they must be organized as a single unit and must be at least five individuals in
number. These spells are generally useless in individual combat.
<P></P>
Spells from the Sphere of War are designed to be used in large-scale battles
like those played using BATTLESYSTEM™ rules; thus, these spells refer to
concepts from this game system. Distances are referred to in linear inches (not game
inches) and times are referred to in BATTLESYSTEM turns, but the DM is free to
modify these statistics to suit combat outside the BATTLESYSTEM rules.
<P></P>
The deities who preside over the Sphere of War are careful when granting these
spells to their priests. They will generally grant such spells only when a
priest is about to enter battle. In the case of the more militant war gods, a
priest who petitions for these spells inappropriately or misuses them may suffer
dire consequences.
