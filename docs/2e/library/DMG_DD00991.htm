<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Lyre of Building:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The enchantments placed upon this instrument make it indistinguishable from a
normal one. Even if its magic is detected, it cannot be told from an ordinary
instrument until it is played. If the proper chords are struck, a single use of
the lyre will negate the effects of a <I>horn of blasting,</I> a <I>disintegrate</I> spell, or the effects of up to three rounds of attack from a ram or similar
siege item. The lyre can be used in this way once per day.
<P></P>
The lyre is also useful with respect to actual building. Once a week its
strings can be strummed so as to produce chords that magically construct buildings,
mines, tunnels, ditches, or whatever. The effect produced in but three turns of
playing is equal to the work of 100 men laboring for three days.
<P></P>
A check must be made whenever the lyre is played. Under normal circumstances,
a false chord is sounded on a roll of 1-3 on 1d20. (Characters with the musical
instrument proficiency play a false chord only on a roll of 1.) If the player
of the lyre is under physical or mental attack, the chance of a false chord
increases to 1-10. (Proficient characters resolve a proficiency check by the
standard rules under these circumstances.) If a false chord is struck, all effects
of the lyre are 20% likely to be negated.
