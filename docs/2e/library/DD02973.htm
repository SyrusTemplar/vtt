<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Animal Master</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Animal masters have an affinity with nature?s creatures. They can be
trainers, keepers, or guardians of animals. Good-aligned animal masters protect and
care for animals, evil ones use simple creatures to their own advantage. Many
animal masters spend much of their time outside with their furred, feathered, or
scaled friends. Animal masters could include rangers, huntsmen, falconers, and
druids.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Benefits:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> When this kit is chosen, the player and DM must determine a suitable animal
companion for the character. There are several factors to consider: 1) the
climate and terrain of the animal master?s homeland, where he acquired the
companion; 2) the character?s alignment, as companions are attracted only to animal
masters of like demeanor; 3) the character?s race (dwarves and gnomes might attract
burrowing or underground creatures, while elves would attract forest
creatures) and; 4) the availability of compatible creatures. All animal companions
should be size S (small). An animal companion is similar to a wizard?s familiar in
that it has a bond with the animal master. The master can issue it simple verbal
commands, and the animal can convey its needs and emotions.
<P></P>
After making a list of available and compatible creatures, the player should
choose one creature as a companion. DMs might prefer the animal to be selected
randomly. If this is the case, roll 1d20 and consult the chart below.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hindrances:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The animal master must protect his companion, not send it into dangerous
areas to spring hidden traps. Should an animal master lose his companion through
carelessness or by capriciously placing the animal in danger, he loses 10% of his
current experience point total, and he loses his affinity to that species. No
other creature of that type will serve as a companion for that animal master.
No penalties are assessed if the animal dies through natural causes,
accidentally, or while following orders of a reasonable nature. (However, it?s reasonable
for animals with combat skills to defend their masters.)
