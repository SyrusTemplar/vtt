While the creation of potions and other magical substances often involves a
complex series of laboratory techniques, there are a number of basic processes
common to most experiments.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>1. Calcination
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
This is the process of reducing substances (usually minerals and metals) to
ash by first crushing or grinding them to powder, then subjecting them to high
heat.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>2. Sublimation</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
This is the process of heating a solid substance until it is vaporized, then
quickly cooling the vapor to return it to a solid form.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>3. Distillation</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
This is the process of boiling a liquid until it turns to vapor, then cooling
the vapor until it condenses back into a liquid, thus purifying the liquid.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>4. Absorption/Adsorption
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
This is a method for purifying gases or liquids by exposing them to charcoal
particles or other filtering substances; the impurities are attracted to the
particles, thus purifying the gas or liquid. If the impurities are actually taken
inside the particles, then absorption has taken place. If the impurities remain
on the surface of the particles, then adsorption has occurred.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>5. Flame Test
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
This is a method of identifying unknown substances by holding them in a hot
flame. The color of the flame indicates the nature of the substance; for
instance, a green flame indicates the presence of copper.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>6. Chromatography
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
This is a simple method for analyzing certain types of unknown substances. The
substance is first dissolved in water or other liquid. A sample of the liquid
then is poured into a glass tube lined with filter paper, and a solvent is
added. Because the components of the substance move through the filter at different
speeds, each will appear as a different colored band in the tube.
