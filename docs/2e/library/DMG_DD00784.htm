<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ring of Chameleon Power:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Whenever the wearer of this ring desires, he is able to magically blend in
with the surroundings. This enables 90% invisibility in foliage, against walls,
and so forth.
<P></P>
If the wearer is associating with creatures of Intelligence 4 or greater at a
distance of 60 feet or less, the ring enables the wearer to seem to be one of
those creatures, but each turn of such association carries a 5% cumulative
chance that the creatures will detect the ring wearer for what he is. Thus, such an
association can never persist for more than 20 turns without the wearer being
detectedâ€”at the end of that time, the chance of detection has risen to 100%.
Creatures with 16 or greater Intelligence use their Intelligence score as an
addition to the base chance of detection. For example, a creature of Intelligence 16
would have a base chance of (16+5%) = 21% at the end of turn 1, 26% at the end
of turn 2, and so forth. Creatures with 3 or lower Intelligence instinctively
and automatically detect the wearer if they come within a 10-foot radius of him.
