Characters who are only wading are much less affected. Wading in knee-deep
water reduces movement by 1/3. Wading in waist-deep water reduces movement by 1/2
and adds a one-phase initiative penalty to any action the character takes.
Wading in shoulder-deep water reduces movement by 2/3, adds a two-phase penalty,
and causes the character to lose any Dexterity adjustment to his Armor Class
(although it does provide cover against someone firing missiles at the character).
