Fighters are experts with weapons, and they are often masters of tactics and
strategy. Perseus, Hercules, Hiawatha, Beowulf, and Sinbad are fighters of
legend. Hannibal, Alexander the Great, Charlemagne, and Spartacus are real-world
warriors.

with Character Points

Fighters have 15 character points to spend on abilities. Each of the abilities
below cost 5 to 10 character points. Any unspent points can be used to acquire

spends his character points to acquire the abilities of weapon specialization
and gaining followers.
