<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ring of Weakness:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This cursed ring causes the wearer to lose 1 point of Strength and 1 point of
Constitution per turn until the individual reaches three in each ability. This
loss is not noticeable until the individual actually observes his weakened
state through some exertion (such as combat or heavy lifting). The ring can also
make the wearer invisible at will (at the cost of double the standard rate of
Strength and Constitution loss). When the affected abilities reach 3, the wearer
will be unable to function in his class.
<P></P>
Points lost from the ring are restored by rest on a one-for-one basis, with 1
point of each ability lost being restored in one day of rest. The <I>ring of weakness</I> can be removed only if a <I>remove curse</I> spell, followed by a <I>dispel magic,</I> is cast upon the ring.
<P></P>
There is a 5% chance that this procedure will reverse the ring's effect,
changing it to a <I>ring of berserk strength.</I> This increases Strength and Constitution at a rate of 1 point per ability per
turn, to a maximum of 18 each (roll percentile dice for bonus Strength if the
wearer is a warrior). However, once 18 is reached in both abilities, the wearer
will immediately melee with any opponent he meets, regardless of
circumstances. Berserk strength is lost when the ring is removed (by casting a <I>remove curse</I>), as are Constitution points gained.
