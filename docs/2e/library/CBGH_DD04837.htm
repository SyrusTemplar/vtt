the protecter of the forests and glades that are so important to gnomish
well-being. Even the Svirfneblin honor him as the &quot;Father of Fish and Fungus.&quot; Baervan
is also the patron of gnomish thieves and a mischief-maker to rival Garl
himself. He is pictured as a spry old gnome with nut-brown skin and a jaunty beard.
His friend and constant companion in his escapades is a giant raccoon named
Chiktikka Fastpaws.
