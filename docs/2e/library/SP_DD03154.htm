<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Fighting Style Specialization</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Fighting styles represent broad categories of battle tactics that can be
employed by characters. They are described in detail in the <A HREF="CT_DD02472.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="CT_DD02472.htm">Combat and Tactics</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> book. Even without that volume, however, players of the Skills and Powers
rules can spend weapon proficiencies on fighting styles, gaining some bonuses in
battle.
<P></P>
There is a difference between knowing a style and specializing in that style.
Every character with a weapon proficiency knows at least one fighting style?the
style used with that weapon. There is no cost to acquire the fighting style;
it comes with the proficiency. Indeed, if a weapon can be used with two or more
different styles, the character is assumed to know all of those styles. A long
sword, for example, can be used with the one-handed weapon fighting style, the
weapon and shield fighting style, or the two-handed weapon fighting style.
Thus, a character with proficiency in the long sword knows all three of these
fighting styles.
<P></P>
Character classes put some limitations on learning fighting styles. <A HREF="DD03155.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03155.htm">Table 52</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> shows the classes that can normally learn a specific style. While a rogue,
for example, can use a long sword, he does not automatically learn the two-handed
weapon style with this blade.
<P></P>
A character can spend an additional character point when he purchases a weapon
proficiency to learn a style that is not normally provided to his character
class. The rogue, for example, spends 3 character points for his long sword
proficiency slot, but only learns it as a one-handed weapon. If he spends a 4th
character point, he can learn the two-handed style or the weapon and shield style
as well; or he can spend a total of 5 character points and learn the long sword
and all three of its styles.
<P></P>
A character can spend a weapon proficiency slot to specialize in the use of
one of these fighting styles, as long as he already knows that style. Warriors
can specialize in as many styles as they wish to purchase. Priests and rogues can
only specialize in one style. Wizards can specialize in a single fighting
style, but only by paying an extra character point to acquire the weapon
proficiency slot.
<P></P>
Each of the styles has specific benefits when acquired as a specialization.
These are described below:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="dbac2458"></A><A NAME="dbac2458"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">One-handed Weapon
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The character can use his empty hand as a secondary weapon, using it to punch,
grab, throw, etc. while he is wielding his one-handed weapon. Normal penalties
for using two weapons apply.
<P></P>
A character who specializes in the one-handed weapon style of battle gains an
AC bonus of +1 when he fights with a weapon in one hand, and no shield or
weapon in his other hand. By spending 2 additional character points, the character
can improve this AC bonus to a maximum of +2.
<P></P>
If the character is also familiar with the two-handed weapon style, and is
wielding a weapon that can be used either way, he can switch back and forth at the
start of every round of combat.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="8640b350"></A><A NAME="8640b350"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Weapon and Shield
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character who specializes in this style can gain a +1 benefit to his AC (in
addition to his regular shield effects) or a +1 on his attack roll during any
melee round when he holds a shield and wields a weapon. Alternately, this
benefit can be superseded by the more detailed shield rules in the<A HREF="CT_DD02627.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="CT_DD02627.htm"> <I>Combat and Tactics</I></A><I></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> book.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="8205507c"></A><A NAME="8205507c"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Two-handed Weapon</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
A character who specializes in the two-handed weapon style improves (lowers)
the speed factor of a weapon by 3?if that weapon is wielded with two hands. In
addition, if the character is using a one-handed weapon with two hands, the
weapon gains a +1 bonus to all damage rolls.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="686aff0d"></A><A NAME="686aff0d"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Two Weapon
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The proficiency slot spent to specialize in this difficult style requires 1
additional character point when it is first acquired?except for rangers, who can
buy it for the same cost as any other fighting style specialization.
<P></P>
A character who specializes in the two weapon style counters some of the
penalties inherent in using two weapons. Normally, a character suffers a ?2 to
attacks with the primary hand, and ?4 to attacks with the secondary hand; this
specialization reduces the penalty to 0 for the primary hand, and ?2 for the
secondary hand. Additionally, if a character has the trait of ambidexterity coupled
with this specialization, he suffers no penalty for either hand.
<P></P>
The secondary weapon must be one size smaller than the primary weapon?unless
the primary weapon is size S. If a character spends 2 additional character
points on this specialization, however, he can learn to use two weapons of equal
size, so long as each of the weapons can be wielded in one hand.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="910e4ece"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Missile
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character who specializes in the missile fighting style gains a significant
bonus. He can move up to half his normal movement rate and still make all of
his allowed missile attacks during a turn. Or he can move his full movement rate
and make half as many attacks.
<P></P>
Additionally, a character who has specialized in this fighting style gains a
+1 bonus to his AC when attacked by missile fire, but only if the specialist
character is also using a missile weapon and attacking on that round.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="3c86a85a"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Horse Archery</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
A character who specializes in the horse archery fighting style can shoot with
accuracy even while mounted. The normal penalties for shooting from the saddle
are reduced by 2. Thus, archers suffer no penalty if the horse is moving at up
to half its normal speed, and they suffer only a ?2 penalty if the horse is
moving faster.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="169fd401"></A><A NAME="169fd401"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Thrown Weapon
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character who specializes in this fighting style gains the same bonuses as a
character who specializes in the missile fighting style.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Special
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> There are numerous types of fighting styles that originated and were perfected
in different historical and geographical areas. A character can spend a
proficiency slot to specialize in one of these types, though the DM is the final
arbiter of what types of fighting styles might be allowed. Players are encouraged
to do a little research before they try to build a case for a specific fighting
style.
<P></P>
Some suggested benefits for the use of one of these styles include:
<P></P>
?1 bonus to Armor Class.
<P></P>
+1 bonus to hit or damage rolls.
<P></P>
The character can ignore penalties for fighting with two weapons.
<P></P>
The character gets a free kick or punch as well as his weapon attack.

<A NAME="5ca1cd70"></A><A NAME="5ca1cd70"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Weapon Specialization and Mastery</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Gaining a weapon proficiency indicates that a character is trained in the
use of that particular weapon, but he is not at the pinnacle of accomplishment.
Fighters, and possibly other characters, can devote a great deal of effort and
energy (reflected in character points) to improve their skills with a weapon
beyond the standard of basic proficiency.
<P></P>
In the <I>Skills and Powers</I> rules, characters of all classes can improve their skills with weapons. The
cost in character points is higher for non-fighter classes, but if a player
wants his wizard character to emulate the wizard Gandalf and wield a mighty blade
such as Orcrist, it is possible.
<P></P>

<A NAME="6ea956a6"></A><A NAME="6ea956a6"></A><A NAME="6ea956a6"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Ranks of Weapon Mastery
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The rules of this section begin with the assumption that a character has
already acquired a weapon proficiency.
<P></P>
Two additional levels of mastery (high mastery and grand mastery) might be
available to single-classed fighters. These are described in the <A HREF="CT_DD02642.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="CT_DD02642.htm">Combat and Tactics</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> book.

<A NAME="8baa7f7a"></A><A NAME="8baa7f7a"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Weapon of Choice
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character can designate a specific weapon as his favorite. He must be
proficient with that weapon already, and even if the proficiency he possesses applies
to an entire tight or broad group, the weapon of choice must be designated.
<P></P>
Characters of all classes can designate a weapon of choice. Warriors can do so
for a cost of 2 character points, rogues and priests for 3 points, and wizards
must spend 4 points.
<P></P>
A player can declare a weapon of choice when he first creates a character, or
at any point thereafter?as long as he has the character points. They should
receive some training or extensive practice from a warrior who is proficient in
the same weapon and has a higher experience level than the trainee. Alternately,
any character can train someone if he possesses a higher level of weapon
mastery (weapon expertise or better) with that weapon.
<P></P>
A character receives a +1 bonus on all attack rolls when using his weapon of
choice.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="0d98e2e0"></A><A NAME="0d98e2e0"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Weapon Expertise
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Weapon expertise is a more limited version of weapon specialization. Unlike
specialization, however, it is available to non-warriors. Before gaining weapon
expertise, the character must be proficient in the use of the selected weapon.
It may or may not already be the character?s weapon of choice (<A HREF="DD03154.htm#8baa7f7a"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03154.htm#8baa7f7a">see above</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">).
<P></P>
Weapon expertise costs a ranger, paladin, or multi-classed warrior 2 character
points (or 1 if the weapon is already the character?s weapon of choice).
Rogues and priests must spend 4 character points (or 3, if the weapon is already the
weapon of choice). Wizards can purchase weapon expertise for a cost of 5
character points, though if the weapon is already the character?s weapon of choice
the cost is only 4 additional points.
<P></P>
As with weapon of choice, a player can declare a weapon of expertise when he
first creates a character, or at any point thereafter?as long as he has the
character points. If the selection is made by an active character, he should
receive extensive training from a warrior who is proficient in the same weapon and
has a higher experience level than the trainee.
<P></P>
Weapon expertise allows a character to gain extra attacks as if a weapon
specialist. At first level, an expert with a long sword can attack three times every
two rounds. Weapon expertise does not confer extra attack or damage bonuses,
though the character may receive an attack benefit if he has weapon expertise in
the use of his weapon of choice, as explained above.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="dd438c91"></A><A NAME="dd438c91"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Weapon Specialization
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character receives extra bonuses for using a specific weapon by spending
character points on specialization. Single-classed fighters can become weapon
specialists at any point in their careers simply by spending a second weapon
proficiency slot on a weapon with which they are already proficient.
<P></P>
Characters of a fighter subclass, or multi-classed fighters, can specialize in
weapon use, though at an increased cost in character points. In addition,
other characters must achieve certain minimum levels of experience before they can
attain a weapon specialization. These costs, and the minimum experience level,
are shown on <A HREF="DD03156.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03156.htm">Table 53</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">: Gaining Weapon Specialization.
<P></P>
A character who receives a weapon specialization during a campaign must be
trained by a character with a specialization (or higher) level of skill in that
same weapon. The training requires a number of months equal to the character
point cost to purchase the specialization, and this training is a full-time
occupation.
<P></P>
The effects of weapon specialization vary by the type of weapon, as follows.
If a specialist weapon (such as a spear) can be used as a melee or a missile
weapon, the character gets the appropriate benefits for each type of use.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Melee Weapons:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The character gets a +1 bonus to attack rolls and +2 to damage rolls when
using the weapon. Also, the character gets one extra attack every two rounds. At
first level, for example, a specialist with the long sword would be able to make
three attacks every two rounds.
<P></P>
<A NAME="d814f5a1"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Missile Weapons: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This category includes slings and thrown weapons. The character gains a +1
attack bonus at all range categories. In addition, specialists enjoy an increased
number of missile attacks. This is detailed in the<I> <A HREF="PHB_DD01527.htm"></A></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="PHB_DD01527.htm">Player?s Handbook</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. At the DM?s option, players can elect to use the more detailed specialist
attack rules in the <A HREF="CT_DD02636.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="CT_DD02636.htm">Combat and Tactics</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> book.
<P></P>
Also, a character who specializes in any type of bow or crossbow gains a
benefit for a new range category: point blank. Point blank shots inflict +2 points
of damage. Point blank ranges are 30' for bows, and 60' for crossbows. In
addition, if the character has a missile loaded and aimed, he can shoot at the
beginning of a melee round?even before initiative is determined.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="eedf566d"></A><A NAME="eedf566d"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Unarmed Combat Specialization
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character can choose to specialize in a type of unarmed combat?either
punching (pummeling in the <A HREF="CT_DD02672.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="CT_DD02672.htm">Combat and Tactics</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> book), wrestling, or martial arts. Fighters, multi-classed fighters, and
fighter subclasses can elect to specialize in unarmed combat. Like any other
specialization, the type of unarmed combat chosen is the character?s only area of
specialization?he cannot also specialize in a weapon.
<P></P>
Specialists in unarmed combat receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +2 on
damage rolls. In addition, they receive the same number of extra attacks any
other specialist receives?typically one extra attack every two rounds.
<P></P>
Unarmed combat procedures, levels of skill, and specialization are covered to
a much greater extent in <A HREF="CT_DD02668.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="CT_DD02668.htm">Combat and Tactics</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.

<P></P>
<A NAME="ee599d34"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Weapon Mastery
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Weapon mastery designates those characters who strive toward the ultimate
level of skill with their weapon of specialization. Weapon masters are generally
individuals of considerable reputation and note in their campaign worlds, often
sought by younger characters for their knowledge. Many of these masters take
apprentices, acting as mentors for the training and development of aspiring
masters. Other weapon masters live solitary, even hermit-like lives, obsessing on
some important task that will allow no interference from the rest of the world.
<P></P>
The most common weapons employed by masters are swords, though bows, axes, and
spears are also allowed. If a player wishes his character to master in a
different weapon, he must create (with DM input) a rationale for a strong cultural
or campaign historical background. An archetype such as William Tell, for
example, can be used to justify a mastery in the crossbow in a medieval-type
campaign. If the DM will not allow a weapon to be mastered, the player should be
informed before the character specializes in that weapon.
<P></P>
A fighter character must have reached a minimum of 5th level before he can
become a weapon master; other characters must progress even farther. The minimum
level for weapon mastery in every character class is 4 higher than the minimum
for specialization, shown on Table 54. A character must possess weapon
specialization in the weapon he will attempt to master. When these criteria are met,
character points must be spent based on the character?s class (see <A HREF="DD03163.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03163.htm">Table 54</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> below) to gain a mastery.
<P></P>
In addition, the character must find an existing master and be trained in
weapon mastery. The master will often demand a significant payment for this
training, or else require that the apprentice perform a quest or some other task
before he will be accepted as a student. Training for weapon mastery requires twice
as many months as training for weapon specialization (i.e. <I>twice</I> the character point costs to gain the mastery, shown on Table 54).
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Effects of Mastery:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A master?s attack and damage bonuses with a melee weapon are both +3. With a
missile weapon, the attack bonus becomes a +2 at all ranges beyond point blank.
At point blank range the attack and damage bonuses are each +3.
