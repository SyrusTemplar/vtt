flavor to battles in an AD&amp;D game.

In most forms of personal combat, there is a lot more going on than a cycle of
swing-and-miss and swing-and-hit actions. In a fight, people move around. They
press advantages or fall back when they need to get some room. Consider a pair
of boxers. They’re not just throwing punches; they’re ducking, dodging,
weaving, and trying different attack strategies such as jabs, hooks, or uppercuts.
<P></P>
Armed combat is much the same. Position is important. Enemies try to surround
lone characters to get flank or rear attacks. Large creatures such as giants or
dragons use their bulk to knock smaller opponents back and scatter defenses.
These are not unusual attacks or special maneuvers; they’re things that just
happen in the chaos of a fight.
<P></P>
The <I>Player’s Option</I> combat system incorporates these effects and tactics, making them available
for heroes and monsters both. Your battles will never be the same again.
