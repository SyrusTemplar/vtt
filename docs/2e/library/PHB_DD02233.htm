By use of a<I> commune</I> spell, the priest is able to contact his deity--or agents thereof--and
request information in the form of questions that can be answered by a simple “yes”
or “no.” The priest is allowed one such question for every experience level he
has attained. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's
knowledge. “I don't know” is a legitimate answer, as powerful outer planar beings
ar not necessarily omniscient. Optionally, the DM may give a single short
answer of five words or less. The spell will, at best, provide information to aid
character decisions. Entities communed with structure their answers to further
their own purposes. It is probable that the DM will limit the use of<I> commune</I> spells to one per adventure, one per week, or even one per month, for the
greater powers dislike frequent interruptions. Likewise, if the caster lags,
discusses the answers, or goes off to do anything else, the spell immediately ends.
<P></P>
The material components necessary for a<I> commune</I> spell are the priest's religious symbol, holy (unholy) water, and incense. If
a particularly potent commune is needed, a sacrifice proportionate with the
difficulty of obtaining the information is required. If the offering is
insufficient, no information or only partial information is gained.
