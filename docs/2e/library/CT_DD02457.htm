Creatures reduced to negative hit points are incapacitated and begin losing 1
hit point per round until they reach ?10, at which point they die. A creature-s
loss of hit points can be halted by binding its wounds, using the healing
proficiency, or casting some kind of curative magic on the victim.
<P></P>
Characters who have been reduced to 0 hit points or less are helpless; they
can-t tend their own wounds or take any actions. At exactly 0 hit points, the
character is simply unconscious, and remains so until healed or until 2d6 full
turns pass. If a character-s death is prevented by binding his wounds or healing
him, the character is completely helpless for at least 24 hours.
<P></P>
It is dangerous to leave characters at a negative hit point total for long.
Each day that a character begins with negative hit points, roll a d10 and compare
it with the absolute value of the character-s hit points (in other words, take
into account only the numerical value of the hit points, ignoring the negative
sign). If the die roll is less than this numerical score, the character loses
1d4 additional hit points. This additional loss of hit points can be avoided if
someone with the healing proficiency is there to tend to the patient, or if
curative magic is used.

<I> For example, Gorathan the Unlucky was badly mauled by a dire wolf and reduced
to ?5 hit points. His companions bound his wounds, but no clerics or proficient
healers were nearby, so Gorathan didn-t recover any hit points. The next day,
a d10 is rolled to see if he worsens or not. If the roll is a 4 or less (which
is less than the ?5? of Gorathan-s ?5 hit points), Gorathan loses 1d4
additional hit points. If the roll is a 5 or better, Gorathan recovers hit points
normally for a day of bed rest. If Gorathan has some bad rolls, he might not make it.
