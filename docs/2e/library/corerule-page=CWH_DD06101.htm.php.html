Specialists usually derive their names from the names of their schools by
changing the suffix. Thus, from <I>abjuration</I> comes the <I>abjurer</I>, and from <I>illusion</I> comes the <I>illusionist</I>. Most of the time, this technique is satisfactory.
<P></P>
However, some schools simply do not lend themselves to wizardly-sounding
names. For instance, the word <I>alterer</I> is clumsy, so the school of alteration has opted for the less awkward <I>transmuter</I> for the name of their specialist. We have a similar problem with our school
of metamorphics-- both <I>metamorphist</I> and <I>metamorpher</I> are clumsy. Returning to the thesaurus, we find the word <I>transfigure</I>. We can call our specialist a <I>transfigurist</I>.
