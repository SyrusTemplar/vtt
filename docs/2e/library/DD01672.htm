<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">At the heart of the combat system is the attack roll. This is the die roll
that determines whether an attack succeeds or fails. The number a player needs in
order to make a successful attack roll is also called the ?to-hit? number.
<P></P>
Attack rolls are used for attacks with swords, bows, rocks, and other weapons,
as well as blows from fists, tackling, and other hand-to-hand attacks. Attack
rolls are also used to resolve a variety of potentially injury-causing actions
that require accuracy (for example, throwing a rock at a small target or
tossing a sword to a party member in the middle of a fight).
