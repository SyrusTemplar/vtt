<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Encumbrance and Movement </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I>The AD&amp;D Master's Options</I>: <I>Skills and Powers</I> rules retain the encumbrance categories (None, Light, Moderate, Heavy,
Severe) familiar to players. As always, the level of detail for encumbrance rules is
a matter for DMs and players alike to choose.
<P></P>
The rules of this section are intended to offer streamlining options-ways that
players can retain the necessary details of encumbrance without quite so much
mathematical precision. And, as always, they-re designed to add a few new
elements of fun.
<P></P>
Even the fastest sprinter won-t move so quickly when he-s carrying 140 pounds
of armor, weapons, and adventuring gear. A character-s encumbrance falls into
five categories: None, Light, Moderate, Heavy, and Severe. Encumbrance is
described in the <A HREF="PHB_DD01636.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="PHB_DD01636.htm">Player's Handbook</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> in Chapter Six: Money and Equipment.
<P></P>
To determine the character-s encumbrance category, find his Strength and read
across the <A HREF="DD03163.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03163.htm">table</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. The numbers on the table are the breakpoints for each category. A character
with a Strength of 14 is not encumbered until he has 56 pounds of gear, Lightly
encumbered until he has 86 pounds of gear, Moderately encumbered until he
carries 116 pounds of gear, and Heavily encumbered up to a load of 146 pounds.
<P></P>
To calculate a monster-s strength for this purpose, add 31_2 points per size
category (rounded down) to the monster-s base Hit Dice (ignoring plusses).

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> If the standard encumbrance rules aren-t worth the trouble, here-s an easier
way to do it. Most of the weight a character carries is in armor and weapons. To
streamline things, only use the character-s armor, shield, and largest weapon
when figuring the total weight carried. This slightly favors PCs, but it-s much
faster than tracking every addition of weight.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Characters who have a high score in either Dexterity/Balance or
Strength/Stamina, or both, can increase their base movement allowance above the 6 or 12 for
characters of their race.
<P></P>
For characters with high Strength/Stamina scores, add the character-s Attack
adjustment (bonus added on rolls to hit) to the character-s base movement
allowance.
<P></P>
If a character has a high Dexterity/Balance score, add the character-s
Reaction/Attack adjustment to the base movement allowance.
<P></P>
A character with multiple high scores can add the bonuses from both of these
categories.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> In addition to weight, the items of equipment are given a bulk rating-an
expansion of the earlier categories S, M, and L. The bulk ratings are separate from
weight, and represent how much space each object takes up.

*Some large objects, particularly weapons, will actually have lower bulk
points than 6. Since the weapon size is primarily a factor of length, these items
can be transported with relative ease.
<P></P>
Players who want the added realism can keep track of how many points of bulk
they are carrying. The rule is especially useful for planning a trading caravan
and calculating how many goods an individual porter or beast of burden can
carry. Vessels such as packs and pouches are limited in how much bulk they can
carry:
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Backpacks </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">can vary in size, and they hold an amount of bulk equal to a character-s
Strength score.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Belt pouches</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> can hold up to 3 bulk points. A single character can wear no more than two
belt pouches.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Saddlebags</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> (horse or mule) can hold up to 4 bulk points, and each animal carries two
saddlebags. The capacities of some other animals include (per saddlebag): dog=1;
donkey/burro=3; camel=10; elephant=20.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="9af8340d"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Effects of Bulk</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
A human character can carry an amount of bulk equal to his Strength/Stamina
score without suffering any ill effects. If he tries to carry more bulk than his
score allows, he suffers one penalty in encumbrance class. For example, if
Blutar, with a Strength/Stamina of 17, is loaded down with 20 bulk points of light
material, his encumbrance might only be Light, but for game purposes it is
treated as Moderate.
<P></P>
Smaller characters can carry less than their Strength/Stamina score in bulk
before they suffer the encumbrance penalty, as follows:
<P></P>
<B>Halflings</B> and <B>gnomes</B> can carry 1/2 their Str/Stamina score in bulk.
<P></P>
<B>Elves</B> can carry their Strength/Stamina ?3 in bulk points.
<P></P>
<B>Dwarves</B> can carry their Strength/Stamina ?1.
<P></P>
A character-s weapon does not count toward his bulk rating, though a shield
does. Armor is not counted as bulk, but it has the effect of lowering the total
bulk the character could otherwise bear. See the <A HREF="DD03175.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03175.htm">equipment tables</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> to determine the capacity penalties for each type of armor.
<P></P>
No character can carry more than twice his Strength/Stamina score in bulk.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Recording Encumbrance (Simplified)
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Characters can simplify the recording of encumbrance for purposes of the
Skills and Powers rules. For most encounters, determine the character-s encumbrance
by considering only his armor, shield and largest weapon. These are generally
the most significant parts of his load, and thus will provide a reasonably
accurate rating.
<P></P>
If the character is carrying camping or exploring equipment, or trade goods,
extra supplies, etc., the additional encumbrance also can be simplified. If the
character is carrying a backpack, figure 10 pounds if he has miscellaneous
exploring equipment (rope, lantern, oil, spikes, etc.), 20 pounds for camping
equipment (bedroll, cloak or spare clothes, tinderbox and food). Add only five-pound
increments for extra items-trade goods, treasure, extra oil flasks, etc.
