This god is a god of large bodies of water. He doesn't concern himself much
with mortal doings; sailors pray to him for mercy, and he shows them mercy when
he feels like it, and shows them death when he prefers. He is also a storm-god,
the deity of storms upon the sea, and sailors fear him.
<P></P>
His priests pray to him for good winds and good harvests of the sea, and make
sacrifices to him to keep him happy and calm. They also use their powers to
save the creatures of the sea, especially creatures such as mermen and dolphins,
from needless death at the hands of overzealous fishermen. They are also great
explorers of the sea, and when a priest of the ocean-god decides to hide from
other men, only another priest of the same order or an experienced mage can find
him in his underwater haven.
<P></P>
Lesser gods will be gods of individual rivers, lakes, and seas. In some lands,
each of the continent's thousands of rivers will be the domain of a lesser god
or goddess.
<P></P>
Sea-gods are just as likely to be male as female.

The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Animals (aquatic
animals only) and Sky/Weather.
