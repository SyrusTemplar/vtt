<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Feralan</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Description:</B> What happens to
children who wander into the wilderness and are never recovered? Or
worse, children who are abandoned by their families, left in the
woods to fend for themselves? Sadly, most of them eventually succumb
to the dangers of the wild. But a fortunate few are taken in by
animals, raised as part of a lion's brood or a wolf's litter. Cut off
from civilization, they gradually take on the characteristics of the
creatures who adopted them. In the process, they become Feralans,
beings who combine the savagery of a beast with the intellect of a man.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Feralan may look like a human, but
for the most part, he acts like a wild animal. He speaks the language
of animals and lives in their lairs. He leads them on hunts, defends
them against predators, and considers them his family. Yet, the
Feralan retains vestiges of his own race, characterized by his agile
mind and an unshakable curiosity about human civilization. Many
Feralans have picked up enough human language to communicate with
them, albeit on a limited basis.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite his bestial tendencies, the
Feralan's moral principles are not so different from other rangers.
He values the well-being of his followers as much as his own. He
avoids needless killing and considers himself the nemesis of hunters
who stalk game for sport. Greed and jealously are as unknown to the
Feralan as they are to the creatures of the forest.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Familial Species:</I> At the beginning
of his career, the player should choose a familial species for his
Feralan, representing the type of animal that raised him. A Feralan
can have only a single familial species, which never changes. The
familial species must share the Feralan's primary terrain and is
subject to the DM's approval. Animals suitable as familial species
include wild dogs, bears (any), wolves, great cats (any), and
primates (any). The DM may augment this list with additional choices
if he likes; familial species can't be human, demihuman, humanoid, or
of magical or supernatural origin.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Requirements:</B> Feralans must have a
minimum Constitution of 15 and a minimum Strength of 14. They cannot
be of lawful alignment.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Though some humans and demihumans raised
by wild animals have neutral or evil outlooks, only those with good
alignments qualify as Feralans. Because Feralans have little use for
the laws and regulations of the civilized world, most are chaotic good.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Primary Terrain: </B>The vast majority
of Feralans have Forest or Jungle as their primary terrain. Arctic,
Hill, Mountain, Plains, and Swamp are possible but less common.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Role:</B> Many people fear Feralans,
wrongly considering them to be ferocious wildmen or savage
werecreatures. Those who befriend Feralans, however, come to know
them as trustworthy, noble, and even gentle. Still, Feralans remain
wary of most humans and demihumans, finding their actions
unpredictable and often incomprehensible.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Feralans rarely volunteer to join
adventuring parties. However, because Feralans are fervent animal
advocates and protectors of the wild, they are inclined to cooperate
with parties who share their concerns.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; While a Feralan's human companions may
admire his courage and respect his instincts, they may find his
beast-like behavior offensive at best, frightening at worst. After a
hunt, a Feralan may drag the carcass of his prey back to the party's
campsite and eat it raw, tearing off chunks with his familial
followers. Personal hygiene is rarely among a Feralan's priorities,
though he may occasionally lick himself clean. He grooms his animal
friends by picking bugs from their fur, then cuddles up with them to
go to sleep. When disturbed, he may snarl like a wolf. To celebrate
victory over a predator, he may howl at the moon. He communicates in
grunts, growls, and sentence fragments. He may disconcert new
associates by sniffing them.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Secondary Skills</B>: Fisher,
Forester, Hunter, Trapper/Furrier. The secondary skills reflect
talents that Feralans have picked up in the wild; therefore, all
skills have wilderness applications only. A Fisher Feralan, for
instance, may know how to swim and catch fish, but won't be able to
operate a boat.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Required:</I>
club, knife. A Feralan's remaining slots must be spent on primitive
weapons: blowgun (rare), dagger, short bow, dart, hand axe, sling, spear.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonus: </I>Hunting
or Fishing; Trail Signs*. His remaining initial proficiencies must
be chosen from these: Alertness*, Animal Handling, Animal Lore,
Blind-fighting, Direction Sense, Endurance, Fire-building, Fishing,
Foraging, Hunting, Rope Use, Running, Set Snares, Survival, Swimming,
Veterinary Healing*, Weather Sense.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Feralans adorn
themselves in crude smocks or loincloths made of furs and hides. They
wear only what is necessary to keep themselves warm and comfortable.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A Feralan wears no armor, nor does he
carry a shield. His main weapons--the ones associated with his weapon
proficiencies--he makes himself from bones, branches, rocks, and
other natural materials. If he loses or breaks one of these weapons,
he can come up with a replacement in few hours, assuming suitable
materials are available. He can use weapons other than those he
makes, but prefers not to.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Species Enemy: </B>Any.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Followers:</B> Unlike other rangers,
the Feralan begins to receive followers at 5th level. At least half
(rounded up) of his followers will be of his familial species. A
Feralan will receive at most one human, demihuman, or humanoid as a
follower, and this only at 10th level or higher.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Special Benefits:</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Stealth:</I> The Feralan receives a
+10% chance to hide in natural surroundings and a +10% chance to move silently.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Feral Rage:</I> During melee combat,
the initial wounding of an opponent may impel the Feralan into a
frenzy of blood lust, increasing his fighting effectiveness. A
Feralan can make one attempt to become enraged at any particular
opponent. After the first round in which a Feralan inflicts damage on
an opponent, the Feralan has the option of making a saving throw vs.
death magic. If the roll succeeds, the Feralan goes into a feral rage
for the next 2d6 rounds. During that time, the rage gives the Feralan
a +2 bonus to all attack and damage rolls, and his base Armor Class
improves by 2 (an unarmored Feralan's AC is temporarily raised to 8).
However, all attacks must be made against the designated opponent and
the Feralan must attack in every round he's able; he can't
voluntarily break off an attack, or choose to attack a different opponent.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; An enraged Feralan must continue to
attack the designated opponent until the feral rage wears off, or the
opponent dies or escapes. If the rage wears off, the Feralan may
continue to attack normally, or take any other action; however, the
Feralan can't attempt to become enraged again against the same
opponent. If the opponent dies, the feral rage automatically ends. If
the opponent flees, the Feralan will pursue for the duration of the rage.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp; <I>Climbing:</I><B> </B>The Feralan has a base
climbing success rate of 60%. This allows tree climbing at the
Feralan's normal movement rate (cliff climbing instead if the primary
terrain is Arctic, Desert, or Mountain). This ability is much more
limited than the thief ability to climb walls. The climbing modifiers
discussed in Chapter 14 of the <I>Player's Handbook</I> apply in all
situations other than those given.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Speak with Animals:</I> The Feralan
can use this ability at will with animals from his familial species.
The ability is similar to the 2nd level priest spell speak with
animals, but requires no components or casting time.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Familial Rapport:</I> The familial
followers of a Feralan will generally do what they're asked, assuming
they're physically capable of doing so, when the Feralan speaks to
them in their own language. Mistreated familial followers may still
abandon a Feralan, as detailed in the Parting Company section of
Chapter 3.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Animal Training:</I> The Feralan may
train non-familial followers (use guidelines in Chapter 3).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>Call of the Wild:</I> When in his primary terrain,
the Feralan may attempt to summon familial species animals by howling
at the top of his lungs for 1-6 rounds. The DM then secretly rolls
percentile dice. If the result is less than or equal to the Feralan's
Wisdom score plus his level (a 5th level Feralan with Wisdom 15 has a
base chance of 20%), 1-4 familial animals show up within the next
hour. Once they arrive, these animals act as followers for the next
1-4 hours. During this time, the Feralan may command them with his <I>speak
with animals</I> ability. At the end of the 1-4 hour period, the
summoned animals disappear into the wilderness. A Feralan can attempt <I>call
of the wild</I> once per day.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Special Hindrances:</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Limited Magic:</I> Because of his
mental predisposition and animalistic tendencies, a Feralan can only
learn and cast a limited number of spells. He has access only to
spells of the animal sphere and can't cast spells any higher than 2nd
level. Table 41 shows the Feralan's spell progression.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A Feralan may use any magical item
normally allowed a ranger.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Limited Money:</I> A Feralan has
little interest in money or gems, which for the most part are as
worthless to him as rocks. He keeps only enough funds to cover
training costs, equipment replacement, and basic living expenses. He
usually allows fellow party members to divide the remainder of his
share of treasure as they wish. (However, the Feralan still receives
all experience points due him for finding treasure and fellow party
members receive no experience point benefit for the Feralan's share.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>No Fortifications:</I> Lacking
extensive resources but mainly lacking the inclination, a Feralan
will not build a castle or any other type of fortification at any
point in his career.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Reaction Penalty:</I> The rough manner
and appearance of the Feralan inflicts a -3 penalty when encountering
human, demihuman, or humanoid NPCs, including other Feralans.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A Feralan will seldom, if ever, develop
any close relationship with politically powerful human, demihuman, or
humanoid NPCs.</FONT></P>
