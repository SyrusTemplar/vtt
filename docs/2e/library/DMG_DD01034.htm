<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Robe of Scintillating Colors:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This garment appears quite normal, but a magical aura is detectable. Only a
wearer with an Intelligence of 15 or higher and a Wisdom of 13 or more can cause
a <I>robe of scintillating colors</I> to function. If Intelligence and Wisdom are sufficient, the wearer can cause
the garment to become a shifting pattern of incredible hues, color after color
cascading from the upper part of the robe to the hem in sparkling rainbows of
dazzling light.
<P></P>
This effect sheds light in a 40-foot diameter sphere, and it has the power to
hypnotize opponents, making them unable to attack the wearer. A full round
passes before the colors begin &quot;flowing'' on the robe. Each round after that, any
opponent who fails a saving throw vs. spell (or magic resistance check, then
save) will stand hypnotized and transfixed for 1d4+1 rounds. Even when this effect
wears off, additional saves must be made in order to attack.
<P></P>
Furthermore, every round of continuous scintillation of the robe makes the
wearer 5% more difficult to hit with missile attacks or hand-held or body weaponry
(hands, fists, claws, fangs, horns, etc.) until a maximum of 25% (-5) is
attained-five continuous rounds of the dazzling play of hues.
<P></P>
After the initial round of concealment, the wearer is able to cast spells or
engage in all forms of activity that do not require movement of more than 10
feet from his starting position. In noncombat situations, the robe simply
hypnotizes creatures failing their saving throws vs. spell for 1d4+1 turns.
