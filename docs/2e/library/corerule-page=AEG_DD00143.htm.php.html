Also known as a stylet, the stiletto is a short dagger with a strong,
triangular or square-sectioned blade that tapers to a sharp point at the tip. The
stiletto is designed for thrusting, in particular to pierce armor such as leather or
mail. Therefore, the stiletto gives the wielder a +2 bonus to attacks against
plate mail, ring mail, chain mail, and all forms of leather armor. Most
stilettos are made completely of steel.
<P></P>
Most cities, except those involved in a war, prohibit the carrying of a
stiletto since it is an easily concealed weapon.

Stilettos are narrow enough to be concealed in sword canes or even in the
handle of a large sword, such as the long, bastard, or two-handed swords.
