After you have chosen a setting for your character, you should decide his
social background. At the start this need only be done in a general way: select a
poor (or unknown), middle, wealthy or noble class background. This background
will have important effects on what resources are available to the character.
Also be sure to consider how it relates to the thief's motivation (below).
<P></P>
<B>Poor/unknown:</B> Most thieves are from a poor background. Most people would just as well make
an honest living, if they can. For some in the lower classes, however, there is
simply no such opportunity, and so crime becomes a means of survival. The vast
majority of such criminals spend their lives as petty thieves, picking
pockets, mugging people foolish enough to walk the streets at night alone, perhaps
even planning and executing a burglary. These poverty-born thieves form the
backbone of most thieves' guilds. The guild regulates their activities as well as it
can, and uses it as a pool, from which are drawn the most talented and
promising. Because skill and cunning are the ultimate determining factors, many a
famous thief-whether in esteem or power among guild comrades, or outside of the
underworld-rose from the most humble beginnings.
<P></P>
An &quot;unknown&quot; background usually fits in with the poorer classes. This means
the character was an orphan, and does not know his ancestry; his parents may have
been criminals, middle-class artisans, or even wealthy merchants or nobles.
Dickens' Oliver Twist is a classic example of a thief of unknown ancestry. For
all practical purposes, the character is one of the poor people, like everyone
with whom he grew up. However, a hook in the campaign may be the search for, or
accidental discovery of, a character's ancestry.
<P></P>
Player characters from a poor background may, at the DM's option, have a
smaller amount of starting money than they would otherwise (perhaps 2d4 x 10 gp). If
a player character is part of a guild, however, he has probably been accepted
as someone who shows promise, and the guild may provide standard equipment and
money for its apprentice-the equivalent of the usual 2d6 x 10 gp.
<P></P>
<B>Middle:</B> A few thieves may hail from the middle classes, perhaps from families of
artisans and petty merchants. Such characters are less likely to be stealing for
survival, though desperate financial straits may bring people to seek illegal
solutions, which could tie into a whole net of crime.
<P></P>
Imagine, for instance, a locksmith who needs money to support his ailing
mother. The landlord threatens eviction, and so forth; in desperation, the locksmith
turns to the thieves' guild for a quick, easy, high-interest loan. As the
family gets more and more entangled by their debts, the guild decides to accept as
partial payment the locksmith's daughter (and apprentice), to become an
apprentice thief.
<P></P>
But greed is a more typical motivation. Many swindlers come from the middle
class; they decided that there are better profits to be made through dishonesty
than hard work.
<P></P>
Thieves of middle-class origin usually have standard initial funds.
<P></P>
<B>Wealthy/Noble:</B> Still fewer thieves are from affluent families. This is partly because people
with ample funds have little motivation to pick pockets; but even more, it is
because thievery is very much socially unacceptable at this level. There are
exceptions, of course. Wealthy privateers, raiding the trade lanes of rival
nations for glory and plunder, may enjoy a high and respected profile for a time.
And wealthy families of crime lords are a different matter entirely.
<P></P>
In any case, a thief from a wealthy family is expected to distinguish himself
in some way or other-flamboyance, daring, audacity, charm-even if he hides his
identity during his roguish endeavors. Otherwise, what is the point of risking
life and reputation?
<P></P>
This question might be asked of any character, of course. And so we turn to
the topic of motivations.
