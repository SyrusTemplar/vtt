<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Figurines of Wondrous Powers:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">There are several kinds of <I>figurines of wondrous power.</I> Each appears to be a tiny statuette of an animal an inch or so high. When the
figurine is tossed down and a command word spoken, it becomes a living animal
of normal size (except when noted below). The animal obeys and serves its owner.
<P></P>
If a <I>figurine of wondrous power</I> is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined, all magic
is lost, and it has no power. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply
reverts to a statuette and can be used again at a later time.
<P></P>
When a figurine is first found, roll percentile dice and consult the table
below to determine the type of animal the figurine becomes:

<I>Ebony Fly:</I> At a word, this small, carved fly comes to life and grows to the size of a
pony. The <I>ebony fly</I> is Armor Class 4, has 4+4 Hit Dice, and maneuverability class C. It flies at
a movement rate of 48 without a rider, 36 carrying up to 210 pounds weight, and
24 carrying from 211 to 350 pounds weight. The item can be used a maximum of
three times per week, 12 hours per day. When 12 hours have passed or when the
command word is spoken, the <I>ebony fly</I> once again becomes a tiny statuette.
<P></P>
<I>Golden Lions:</I> These come in pairs. They become normal adult male lions (Armor Class 5/6,
5+2 Hit Dice, and normal attack modes). If slain in combat, the lions cannot be
brought back from statuettes form for one full week; otherwise, they can be used
once every day. They enlarge and shrink upon speaking the command word.
<P></P>
<I>Ivory Goats:</I> These come in threes. Each goat of this trio looks slightly different from
the others, and each has a different function. These are:
<P></P> 
<B>? </B> The Goat of Traveling?This statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount of
Armor Class 6, with 24 Hit Points and 2 attacks (horns) for 1d8 each (consider
as 4 Hit Dice monster). Its movement rate is 48 bearing 280 pounds or less. Its movement is reduced by 1 for every additional 14 pounds of weight carried. The
goat can travel a maximum of one day each week?continuously or in any
combination of periods totalling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is
uttered, it returns to its small form for not less than one day before it can
again be used.
<P></P>
<B>? </B> The Goat of Travail?When commanded, this statuette becomes an enormous
creature, larger than a bull, with sharp hooves (2d4+2/2d4+2), a vicious bite (2d4),
and a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (2d6/2d6). If it is charging to
attack, it may only use its horns, but +6 damage is added to each hit on that
round (i.e., 8-18 hit points per damage per horn). It is Armor Class 0, has 96
hit points, and attacks as a 16 Hit Dice monster. It can be called to life just
once per month up to 12 hours at a time. Its movement rate is 24.
<P></P>
<B>? </B> The Goat of Terror?When called upon with the proper command word, this
statuette becomes a destrier-like mount, movement rate 36, Armor Class 2, 48 hit
points, and no attacks. However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as weapons
(one horn as a <I>spear +3</I> (lance), the other as a <I>sword +6</I>). When ridden versus an opponent, the <I>goat of terror</I> radiates terror in a 30-foot radius, and any opponent in this radius must
roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or lose 50% of strength and suffer at
least a -3 penalty to attack rolls, all due to weakness caused by terror. When all
opponents are slain, or upon the proper command, the goat returns to its
statuette form. It can be used once every two weeks.
<P></P>
After three uses, each of the goats loses its magical ability forever.
<P></P>
<I>Marble Elephant:</I> This is the largest of the figurines, the statuette being about the size of a
human hand. Upon utterance of the command word, a <I>marble elephant</I> grows to the size and specifications of a true elephant. The animal created
from the statuette is fully obedient to the figurine's owner, serving as a beast
of burden, mount, or combatant. The type of <I>marble elephant</I> obtained is determined by rolling percentile dice and consulting the table
below:

Details of each type of creature are found in the <I>Monstrous Compendium.</I> The statuette can be used a maximum of 24 hours at a time, four times per
month.
<P></P>
<I>Obsidian Steed:</I> An obsidian steed appears to be a small, nearly shapeless lump of black
stone. Only careful inspection will reveal that it vaguely resembles some form of
quadruped, and of course, if magic is detected for, the figurine will radiate
magic. Upon speaking the command word, the near formless piece of obsidian becomes
a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy war horse with the following additional
powers: <I>fly</I> (at normal movement speed), go ethereal, go astral. It will allow itself to
be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, it is 10% likely per use to
carry its &quot;master'' to the floor of the first layer of the Gray Waste and then
return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used for a 24-hour period
maximum, once per week. Note that when the obsidian steed becomes astral or
ethereal, its rider and gear follow suit. Thus, travel to other planes can be
accomplished by means of this item.
<P></P>
<I>Onyx Dog:</I> When commanded, this statuette changes into a creature with the same
properties as a war dog, except that it is endowed with Intelligence of 8-10, can
communicate in the Common tongue, and has exceptional olfactory and visual
abilities. The olfactory power enables the <I>onyx dog</I> to scent the trail of a known creature 100% of the time if the trail is one
hour old or less, -10% per hour thereafter. The dog is subject to being thrown
off by false trails, breaks, water, and masking or blocking substances or
scents. The visual power enables the <I>onyx dog</I> to use 90-foot-range infravision, spotting hidden (such as in shadows) things
80% of the time, normally invisible things 65% of the time, and noting astral,
ethereal, and out-of-phase things 50% of the time. For details, see &quot;<A HREF="MM_DD03837.htm#b5ace021"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="MM_DD03837.htm#b5ace021">Dog, War</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> '' in the <I>Monstrous Compendium.</I> An <I>onyx dog</I> can be used for up to six continuous hours, once per week. It obeys only its
owner.
<P></P>
<I>Serpentine Owl:</I> A <I>serpentine owl</I> becomes a normal-sized horned owl (AC 7; move 24; 2d2 hit points; 1d2/1d2
points of damage when attacking) if its possessor so commands, or it can become a
giant owl if its owner so requires. The maximum duration of the transformation
is eight hours in either case. (However, after three transformations into giant
owl form, the statuette loses all of its magical properties.) The normal-sized
form of the magical statuette moves with 95% silence, has infravision to 90
feet, can see in normal, above-ground darkness as if it were full light, and
twice as well as a human. Its hearing is so keen it can detect a mouse moving up to
60 feet away. Anyone or anything trying to move silently has his (or its)
chances reduced 50% against the <I>serpentine owl</I> in smaller form. Furthermore, the owl can and will communicate with its owner
by telepathic means, informing him of all it sees and hears within the
limitations of its intelligence. If commanded to giant-size, a <I>serpentine owl</I> is in all respects the same as a giant owl. For information see &quot;<A HREF="MM_DD03810.htm#602bce84"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="MM_DD03810.htm#602bce84">Owl, Giant</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> ,&quot; in the <I>Monstrous Compendium.</I> As with most other <I>figurines of wondrous power,</I> this one readily obeys all commands of its owner.
