<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Gem of Seeing:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">These finely cut and polished stones are indistinguishable from ordinary
jewels, although a <I>detect magic</I> will reveal its enchantment. When gazed through, the <I>gem of seeing</I> enables the user to detect all hidden, illusionary, invisible, astral,
ethereal, or out-of-phase things within viewing range.
<P></P>
Peering through the crystal is time-consuming and tedious. The viewing range
of the gem is 300 feet for a cursory scan if only large, obvious objects are
being sought, 100 feet if small things are to be seen. It requires one round to
scan a 200-square-foot area in a cursory manner, two rounds to view a
100-square-foot area in a careful way. There is a 5% chance each time the gem is used that
the viewer will see an hallucination, something that is not there, or possibly
through some real thing as if it were an illusion.
