<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">If an encounter escalates into a combat situation, the time scale of the game
automatically goes to <I>rounds</I> (also called melee rounds or combat rounds). Rounds are used to measure the
actions of characters in combat (or other intensive actions in which time is
important).
<P></P>
A round is approximately one minute long. Ten combat rounds equal a <I>turn</I> (or, put another way, a turn equals 10 minutes of game time). This is
particularly important to remember for spells that last for turns, rather than rounds.
<P></P>
But these are just approximations--precise time measurements are impossible to
make in combat. An action that might be ridiculously easy under normal
circumstances could become an undertaking of truly heroic scale when attempted in the
middle of a furious, chaotic battle.
<P></P>
Imagine the simple act of imbibing a healing potion. First, a character
decides to drink the potion before retiring for the night. All he has to do is get it
out of his backpack, uncork it, and drink the contents. No problem.
<P></P>
Now imagine the same thing in the middle of a fight. The potion is safely
stowed in the character's backpack. First, he takes stock of the situation to see
if anyone else can get the potion out for him, but, not surprisingly, everyone
is rather busy. So, sword in one hand, he shrugs one strap of the pack off his
shoulder. Then, just as two orcs leap toward him, the other strap threatens to
slip down, entangling his sword arm. Already the loose strap keeps him from
fully using his shield.
<P></P>
Holding the shield as best as possible in front of him, he scrambles backward
to avoid the monsters' first wild swings. He gets pushed back a few more feet
when a companion shoulders past to block their advance. His companion bought him
a little time, so he kneels, lays down his sword, and slips the backpack all
the way off. Hearing a wild cry, he instinctively swings his shield up just in
time to ward off a glancing blow.
<P></P>
Rummaging through the pack, he finally finds the potion, pulls it out, and,
huddling behind his shield, works the cork free. Just then there is a flash of
flame all around him--a fireball! He grits his teeth against the heat, shock, and
pain and tries to remember not to crush or spill the potion vial. Biting back
the pain of the flames, he is relieved to see the potion is still intact.
<P></P>
Quickly, he gulps it down, reclaims his sword, kicks his backpack out of the
way, and runs back up to the front line. In game terms, the character withdrew,
was missed by one attacker, made a successful saving throw vs. spell (from the
fireball), drank a potion, and was ready for combat the next round.
