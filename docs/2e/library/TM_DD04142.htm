<I> The circumstances which prompt a Power or priest to seek the use of a quest
spell are usually related to a major sphere of concern of the Power.</I> A god of druids is not likely to grant a quest spell to address a matter of
warfare, commerce, politics, knightly virtue, or other irrelevance (as this
Power would view them). However, destruction of a huge swathe of forest by fire is
entirely different. To protect or regenerate a great natural resource, a
druidic Power would surely consider dispatching his most powerful servants with
awesome magic. A major challenge demands a major response.
<P></P>
<I>A Power may choose to equip followers with a quest spell in preparation for a
major conflict with servants of a hostile Power.</I> This may be true for both sides in the conflict; the NPCs as well as the PCS
might be equipped with quest spells. In this manner, two Powers avoid fighting
each other directly; their servants carry out the warfare instead. This will be
a major event in any campaign setting! Milder variations on this theme would
include the razing of a major temple of the enemy Power or the destruction of a
major resource belonging to the Power's servants.
<P></P>
This is a situation in which a DM must exercise caution. This kind of conflict
can easily swerve out of control and threaten the destruction of the game
world; no Power wants this. Only if a Power has stepped out of line is the
retribution by a rival Power tolerable among the community of Powers. If an evil temple
has stood in the capital of an evil land for centuries, it is unacceptable for
a good deity to strike at it. If an evil temple is hidden in nonevil lands, it
is reasonable for a good Power to strike it down. It is important that game
balance and the status quo are maintained.
<P></P>
<I>A Power is likely to grant a quest spell when there is a major threat to his
followers, church, consecrated grounds, or territories.</I> These situations may become considerably extended; a Power of healing may
extend the use of quest magic to help his priests cure a virulent plague affecting
ordinary folk. For such a Power, the welfare of the common man is important.
In cases such as this, game balance must be maintained by granting quest spells
only in true catastrophes.
<P></P>
<I>Exceptional and unique circumstances will arise which will draw quest magic
into the game.</I> This may include racial interests (for elves, dwarves, etc.) such as defense
of the homelands or protection of great fortresses, or it may include
communities of exceptional artisans wishing to draw quest magic from Powers. The
discovery of an intensely magical artifact or place important to the Power may
necessitate the use of quest magic to secure it. Establishing and developing a major
sacred location may justify the use of quest magic (especially with spheres such
as Creation, Guardian, Protection, and Wards). Such cases will be individually
determined by the DM as major elements of a campaign story line.
