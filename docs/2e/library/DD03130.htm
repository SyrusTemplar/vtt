<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Phobia-Darkness:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A real drawback for a dungeon crawler, this disadvantage compels a character
find or create, some source of light when surrounded by utter darkness. The
character will be reluctant to enter darkened settings, only doing so after a
successful Wisdom/Willpower check. He can repeat the check every 1?6 turns, if
necessary, perhaps modified by persuasion or cajolery by comrades. The check is not
necessary if some light is present, though the character still will be nervous
and uncomfortable in a role-playing sense.
<P></P>
If the character passes the check, he can force himself to enter the darkness.
He also must check if suddenly immersed in darkness-for example, if the
party-s torches are suddenly doused within the dungeon. Failure of this check can
result in the character fleeing headlong down a corridor or freezing, terrified,
in place (clinging to a subterranean cliff, perhaps). If circumstances do not
dictate one or the other, flip a coin to determine which reaction the character
suffers.
