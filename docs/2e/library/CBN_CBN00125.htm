This spell temporarily animates the bones of a dead human, demihuman, or
humanoid creature of man-size or less. The resultant skeleton will obey only simple
commands until it is destroyed, turned, or dispelled, or the spell duration
expires. As with the creations of the more powerful <I>animate dead</I> spell, a <I>skeletal servant</I> can be commanded to guard an area, follow the caster, carry heavy objects,and
so on. The servant is not well suited to complex tasks (such as cooking, for
instance) and is generally created to serve as a porter or temporary bodyguard.
<P></P>
A priest may have only one <I>skeletal servant</I> per level of experience in service at once. The material component is a
handful of graveyard dirt. As with the more powerful <I>animate dead</I> spell, the creation of a skeletal servant is not a good act, and only evil
priests use it frequently.
