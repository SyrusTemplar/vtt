<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Quill of Law: </B>This magical pen is used by despots and good rulers alike to ensure that their
laws and proclamations are obeyed. Anyone reading a posted proclamation or law
that was written with the pen must obey the law, regardless of whether it is a
good law.
<P></P>
This effect applies only to persons who actually see the written message. If a
person knows about the law but has not read a notice written with the quill,
he still has the option to obey or break the law. Once he has read it, however,
he must obey it.
<P></P>
The magical effect is limited in that only the three most recent laws written
with the quill maintain this power. Laws written prior to the most recent three
can still be the law, but citizens are not compelled to obey them.
<P></P>
Creatures with 15 or greater Intelligence and 12 or more Hit Dice or levels
are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell when viewing the proclamation. If the
saving throw is successful, the effect is negated and the person is left to his
own moral decisions.
