powerful spells that can be far more dangerous than simple attack spells.
Illusionists must have a minimum Dexterity (Dexterity/Aim) score of 16 to perform the
intricate gestures and patterns required by spells of their school. The school of
illusion/phantasm is opposed by necromancy, invocation/evocation, and
abjuration.
<P></P>
Illusionists gain the normal benefits of specialist wizards. When an
illusionist reaches 8th level, he gains an additional +1 bonus to his saving throws
against illusion spells cast by nonillusionists. (This is cumulative with his
normal +1 bonus, for a total of +2). At 11th level, the illusionist gains the
ability to cast a special <I>dispel phantasmal force </I>or <I>dispel improved phantasmal force </I>up to three times per day. The base chance of success is 50%, ±5% per level
difference between the illusionist and the caster of the phantasmal force; for
example, if a 16th-level illusionist is attempting to dispel an illusion cast by
a 9th-level wizard, his chance of success is 85%. The dispel has a range of 30
yards and a casting time of 1; the illusionist need only point at the illusion
and concentrate. If the illusionist attempts to dispel something that turns out
to be real, the attempt still counts against his limit of three dispels per
day.
<P></P>
An illusionist can be extremely effective in combat despite his lack of
high-powered damaging spells, especially if he concentrates on creating distractions
and false opponents for his enemies. Every sword swing directed at an illusion
is one less that’s aimed at the illusionist and his companions. Illusionists
should always seek creative and unusual uses for their spells; of all the
specialist wizards, they require the most player originality to be run effectively.
