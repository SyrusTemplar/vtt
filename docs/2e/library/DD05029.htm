The basic druid as described in the <A HREF="PHB_DD01489.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01489.htm">PH</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>is referred to here as the &quot;forest druid.&quot; The names of the other branches
reflect their geographic specialty: arctic druids, desert druids, and so on.
<P></P>
Members of all the branches of the druidic order have the same alignment--true
neutral--and worship Nature. They share one ethos and owe at least nominal
allegiance to the world's Grand Druid. But, as befits the infinite diversity of
Nature, every branch differs in details and approach to its mission. The granted
powers and spells that Nature finds appropriate for a druid in one region are
often inappropriate for a druid from a very different climate and terrain.
<P></P>
For instance, while the forest druids described in the <I>PH</I> have major access to the Plant sphere of priest spells, the branch of desert
druids has only minor access to that sphere, reflecting the less abundant plant
life in the desert. Similarly, while a forest druid's ability to pass through
overgrowth is very useful in the woods, it has much less utility for a desert
druid. Instead, the branch of desert druids has granted powers enabling them to
survive in arid country.
<P></P>
Some rivalry exists between the different branches of druids. On most worlds,
the forest druids belong to the dominant branch. However, on a few worlds (such
as one in the midst of an ice age) another branch might wield the most power.

The Dungeon Master can restrict some branches to nonplayer characters (NPCs)
or even prohibit them to suit the background or direction of a campaign. For
example, the Dungeon Master (DM) might decide that the gray druids of the
Underdark would make exciting adversaries for the characters. Since having player
characters (PCs) as gray druids would water down the impact of the gray druids as
foes, the DM can prohibit players from choosing that branch. Later in the
campaign, after the party has encountered the gray druids, the DM might open the
branch to players.
<P></P>
Similarly, some druid branches simply may not seem very logical or useful in
certain campaigns. A wise DM would discourage players from selecting the arctic
branch for their druid characters in a campaign set in a jungle.
