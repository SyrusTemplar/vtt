Normally, a character employing a shield in his off hand can shield-rush,
shield-punch, block, or trap as if it were a secondary weapon, with the normal
penalties for attacking with two weapons. The disadvantage is that the shieldâ€™s AC
bonus is forfeited for any round in which it is used this way.

make one of these secondary attacks every round without losing the AC benefit for
carrying a shield.
