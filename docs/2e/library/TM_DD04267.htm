When this spell is cast, a faintly shimmering aura surrounds the recipient.
The aura insulates the recipient from the effects of nonmagical heat and cold in
a range of -20 F. to 140 F. Any time a traveler encounters temperatures in this
range, he maintains a comfortable temperature of 70 F., regardless of
prevailing weather conditions. Additionally, the spell acts as a shield against rain,
snow, and hail, which are blocked by the aura.
<P></P>
If a recipient encounters a temperature above or below the stated range, the
temperature within the aura is altered by an equal number of degrees. For
example, a recipient who encounters a temperature of 150 will actually experience a
temperature of 80?F.
<P></P>
All physical objects other than rain, snow, and hail can pass through the
aura. The recipient can cast spells normally while the <I>aura of comfort</I> is in effect. The spell offers no protection against magically generated
weather, such as that caused by <I>weather summoning</I> and <I>ice storm</I>. It does not protect against fire, nor does it shield against fire- or
cold-based attacks.
