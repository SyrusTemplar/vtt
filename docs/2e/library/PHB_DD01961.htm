The <I>polymorph other</I> spell is a powerful magic that completely alters the form and ability, and
possibly the personality and mentality, of the recipient. Of course, while a
creature with a lower Intelligence can be polymorphed in form into something with a
higher Intelligence, it will not gain that creature's mental ability. The
reverse--polymorphing a higher Intelligence creature into one of significantly
lower Intelligence--results in a creature much more intelligent than appearances
would lead one to believe. The polymorphed creature must succeed on a system
shock (see <A HREF="DD01430.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01430.htm">Table 3</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) roll to see if it survives the change. After this, it must make a special
Intelligence check to see if it retains its personality (see following).
<P></P>
The polymorphed creature acquires the form and physical abilities of the
creature it has been polymorphed into, while retaining its own mind. Form includes
natural Armor Class (that due to skin toughness, but not due to quickness,
magical nature, etc.), physical movement abilities (walking, swimming, and flight
with wings, but not plane shifting, blinking, teleporting, etc.), and attack
routines (claw/claw/bite, swoop, rake, and constriction, but not petrification,
breath weapons, energy drain, etc.). Hit points and saving throws do not change
from the original form. Noncorporeal forms cannot be assumed. Natural
shapeshifters (lycanthropes, dopplegangers, higher level druids, etc.) are affected for
but one round, and can then resume their normal form.
<P></P>
If slain, the polymorphed creature reverts to its original form, though it
remains dead. (Note that most creatures generally prefer their own form and will
not willingly stand the risk of being subjected to this spell!) As class and
level are not attributes of form, abilities derived from either cannot be gained
by this spell, nor can exact ability scores be specified.
<P></P>
When the polymorph occurs, the creature's equipment, if any, melds into the
new form (in particularly challenging campaigns, the DM may allow protective
devices, such as a <I>ring of protection</I>, to continue operating effectively). The creature retains its mental
abilities, including spell use, assuming the new form allows completion of the proper
verbal and somatic components and the material components are available.
Creatures not used to a new form might be penalized at the DM's option (for example,
-2 to attack rolls) until they practice sufficiently to master it.
<P></P>
When the physical change occurs, there is a base 100% chance that the
subject's personality and mentality change into that of the new form (i.e., a roll of
20 or less on 1d20). For each 1 point of Intelligence of the subject, subtract 1
from the base chance on 1d20. Additionally, for every Hit Die of difference
between the original form and the form it is assuming, add or subtract 1
(depending on whether polymorphed form has more Hit Dice [or levels] or fewer Hit Dice
[or levels] than original, respectively). The chance for assumption of the
personality and mentality of the new form is checked daily until the change takes
place.
<P></P>
A subject acquiring the mentality of the new form has effectively become the
creature whose form was assumed and comes under the control of the DM until
recovered by a <I>wish</I> spell or similar magic. Once this final change takes place, the creature
acquires the new form's full range of magical and special abilities.
<P></P>
For example: If a 1 Hit Die orc of 8 Intelligence is polymorphed into a white
dragon with 6 Hit Dice, it is 85% (20 - 8 Intelligence + 5 level difference
[6-1] = 17 out of 20 = 85%) likely to actually become one in all respects, but in
any case it has the dragon's physical and mental capabilities. If it does not
assume the personality and mentality of a white dragon, it knows what it
formerly knew as well.
<P></P>
The wizard can use a <I>dispel magic</I> spell to change the polymorphed creature back to its original form, and this
requires a system shock roll. Those who have lost their individuality and are
then converted back maintain the belief that they are actually the polymorphed
creature and attempt to return to that form. Thus, the orc who comes to believe
he is a white dragon, when converted back to his orc form, steadfastly
maintains he is really a white dragon polymorphed into the shape of an orc. His
companions will most likely consider him mad.
<P></P>
The material component of this spell is a caterpillar cocoon.
