If the priest deliberately violates the goals of the god, then he's in real
trouble. For instance, if a priest of the god of war advocates peace when war is
in the offing, or if a priest of the god of love tells young lovers to wise up
and forget about romance, then the god will definitely be offended.
<P></P>
The first time this happens, the god will give the priest an unmistakable
warning. This could be a heart attack, costing 50% of the priest's current hit
points. It could be a portentous destruction of a statue of the god while the
priest is present. It could be an earthquake or other warning. The warning doesn't
have to be <I>immediately </I>after the betrayal, but will be soon after.
<P></P>
The second time this happens, the god will appear to the priest. It doesn't
have to be in person, right then; it might be in a dream, the night following the
betrayal. The god will sternly ask the character his motives and order him to
return to proper worship.
<P></P>
The third time this happens, the god will immediately reduce the character to
1 hit point and change his character class. The priest will become an ordinary
fighter at an experience level two lower than the priest's level (minimum first
level); his normal hit point total and possessions will be unaffected. Until
the character undergoes a severe ritual of atonement, the god will despise the
character and plague him with little ills, diseases, and enemies. Once the
character atones for the deed, the god forgives him . . . but the character will
still be a fighter.
<P></P>
Sometimes, a god might deliberately confront the character with a test of the
character's faith. For example: Part of the god's worship demands that anyone
who tramples his sacred flowers be blinded. Then, the god befuddles the priest's
wife or daughter, and that character stumbles across the sacred flowers where
only the priest can see it. If he conceals the sin, he's punished. If,
regretfully, he prepares to carry out the punishment, the god will be pleased. The god
might interrupt the punishment, or wait until it has been carried out and then
restore sight to the priest's loved one.
