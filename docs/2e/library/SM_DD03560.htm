New Spells in the Campaign
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A unique spell is a valuable commodity, one with significant trading value
among other wizards or priests. An enterprising PC can choose to sell his
hard-earned knowledge for whatever price he can get for it, or he can hoard his spell
for his own use. In some cases, a wizard may want to be careful about flashing
his newfound powers about in public; unscrupulous spellcasters have been known
to steal the inventor's spell book in order to wrest the secrets of the new
enchantment from its creator! Priests are less vulnerable to this kind of activity,
but it's always possible that their patron power may take a liking to the
spell and make it available to other priests of the same mythos.
