In most fantasy role-playing games, battles tend to take place in one of four
environments: a dungeon or cave, a town or building, a castle or fortification,
or outside. There are exceptions, of course, but most battles occur in one of
these environments.

The DM can prepare four basic battle maps to represent each one of these
areas, and then modify the map for the particular details of each new battle. For
example, TSR?s <I>Dragon Strike</I>? game includes maps of a town, a meadow, a dungeon, and a cave?with a little
work, the DM could use these generic maps to handle almost any fight.
