This spell allows a wizard to adversely affect all the saving throws of his
enemies. Opponents under the influence of this spell make all saving throws at a
penalty of -1.
<P></P>
Alternatively, the wizard may select any one school of magic and cause his
enemies to make all saving throws against magic from that school at -2. This
penalty is not cumulative with a saving throw penalty derived from the wizard being
a specialist; the penalty is not increased to -3.
