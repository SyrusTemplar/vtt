Obviously, the fence is a form of specialist help, but the guild can also act
to put members in touch with specialists to help them with certain ventures in
more direct ways.
<P></P>
First, certain guild members will be specialists in themselves?expert
lockpickers with exceptional Open Locks skill levels and others such. Multi-class
thieves are also important people for many jobs?a mage-thief with such spells as <I>invisibility, levitate,</I> and <I>knock</I> (to consider but second-level spells) is of obvious value. Having one
accompany a thief on a robbery increases the chances for success considerably, but
even if this isn't possible, a simple <I>invisibility</I> spell precast on the hopeful robber gives an important edge for sneaking past
guards and the like.
<P></P>
Then again, other adventurers might be called upon. Depending on the guild's
relations with other bodies, a cleric (with <I>find traps</I>, among other spells) would be a most useful accomplice for many tasks. If the
DM's campaign world has a deity which is an obvious patron for thieves (such
as Olidammara of Oerth, or Mask of the Forgotten Realms), clerics of such a
deity might well have very cordial relations with a thieves' guild. This is
considered in more detail below.
<P></P>
The guild can thus act as a clearing-house, with names and meeting places to
assist a PC thief hoping to pull a job but needing help. Again, whether these
contacts actually agree to help will depend on many things?notably the reputation
of the PC thief! However, the fact that they are there at all can be helpful
for the PC thief, possibly for his friends as well, and can be very useful
indeed if the thief PC wants to pull some job away from the rest of his usual
adventuring group, when he must have some such extra help for success.
<P></P>
Of course, a thief may simply need the assistance of others of his own kind
for some job he has planned. This may be a simple decoy person to help with
pickpocketing in the streets, or an eagle-eyed lookout for a warehouse job. Either
way, the guildhouse may be a better bet than hanging around dubious taverns and
hostelries. The flipside of this, of course, is that an impoverished PC can
hang around the guildhouse touting for offers of work himself!
<P></P>
Finally, a well-organized guild will even be able to help its members if they
get into serious difficulties. A jailer may be bribed, a magistrate bribed or
blackmailed, a man of law paid to plead the thief's case in the courts (if the
judge or magistrate cannot be bribed). If the captured thief is very senior in
the Guild, even a commando-style &quot;liberation&quot; may be possible! Such actions will
leave the thief indebted to his guild for some time to come . . .
<P></P>
So, these are the main functions of the thieves' guild, as far as a PC thief
entering the guild can see them. There are certainly other things the guild will
do, and we'll look at them in due course. Before that, let's look at the other
side of the coin?the responsibilities the thief has to the guild. For all the
advantages, what does the guildmember have to pay one way or another?
