abject, subject to range, Strength, and Dexterity modifiers. Damage is
determined by the object’s size and hardness, as given above. There is a one-phase
delay when making a ranged pummeling attack; small objects become average, large
objects become very slow. Small objects have a maximum range of 15 yards. Short
range is 5 yards or less, medium range is 5–10 yards, and long range is 10–15
yards. Large objects cannot be thrown unless they can be wielded as improvised
weapons as described above; they have a maximum range of 5 yards and are always
considered to be at medium range. Size Large and larger creatures might be able
to hurl some large objects, such as sacks of coins, as though they were small
objects.
