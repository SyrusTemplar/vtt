</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This category includes jewelry, ornamental drinking vessels, elaborate snuff
boxes, fine crystal and glass, statuary, carvings, and all the other small
embellishments that make life more pleasant and easy to bear. The value of each
should be determined on Table 87.

The DM should name each item found by the player characters, since this helps
them picture in their minds just what they have found.
