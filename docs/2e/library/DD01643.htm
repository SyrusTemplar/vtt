</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The “Base Move” column in <A HREF="DD01641.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01641.htm">Table 49</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> lists the maximum amount an animal can carry and maintain its normal movement
rate. Animals can be loaded greater than this, up to a maximum of twice their
normal load. However, this causes a drop in the animal's movement rate (as
indicated by the column headings). When calculating a mount's load, be sure to
include the weight of the rider!

The values listed in <A HREF="DD01642.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01642.htm">Table 50</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> for standard-sized items. It is certainly possible for sacks, chests, and
backpacks to be larger or smaller than the sizes listed. The weight capacity,
however, lists the maximum weight the item can carry, regardless of size. Beyond
this point, the material used to construct the item will fail, sooner or later.
The volume gives the length, width, and height or depth of the item. Items that
exceed the capacity of a container cannot be stored in it.

Since all player characters are adventurers, it is assumed they know the best
methods for packing and stowing equipment. Blankets are rolled into bedrolls,
small items are carefully arranged, rope is properly coiled, weapons are slung
in the most comfortable manner, etc. While small items can be easily stuffed
into a pack, large bulky things may encumber more than their actual weight would
indicate. The DM has the right to rule that an object is more encumbering than
it actually appears.

<I> Tarus Bloodheart finds a 5 ft. × 9 ft. flying carpet. He carefully rolls it
into a thick cylinder and wisely ties it closed. Even though he has taken this
sensible precaution, the carpet is still a large and awkward thing. The DM rules
that although the carpet weighs only 20 pounds, its encumbrance is equal to
that of an item weighing 50 pounds. Tarus must increase his current encumbrance
level by 50 pounds, adding the awkwardness of the rolled carpet slung over his
shoulder to his already carefully packed backpack.
