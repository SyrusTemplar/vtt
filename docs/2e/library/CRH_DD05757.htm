   A ranger can go through his entire life without ever hearing about a
forgathering, let alone attending one. But chances are that sooner or later, he'll hear
a rumor about an upcoming forgathering, or receive an invitation from another
ranger. He may also notice strange symbols etched on trees or stones, intended
as guideposts to lead attendees to the forgathering site (depending on how
secret is the location of the meeting, a ranger might need the trail sign
proficiency to translate the symbols).

   In most cases, forgathering attendance requires no prior arrangements. These
gatherings are by their nature informal, and they are rarely interrupted by
serious business except under the most unusual circumstances. Any ranger who shows
up is usually welcome; rangers who bring extra meat, fruit, or wine to share
are welcomed with open arms. Attendees are expected to supply their own bedding,
tents, and food. First-timers may be required to perform extra chores, such as
guard duty or trash disposal.

   A ranger may bring non-ranger companions with him as guests, providing the
guests keep to themselves and stay out of the way. The ranger is responsible for
his guests' behavior; should they cause trouble or make nuisances of themselves,
both the ranger and his guests will be summarily ejected. It's unlikely that
ranger will be welcome at any future forgatherings unless things are smoothed
over.
