The DM may want to slant some of his campaign's adventures specifically to his
priest player-characters. It's not hard to do that; he has only to build the
adventure around one or more of the priest's duties or responsibilities.
<P></P>
The priest-oriented plot device we use to motivate the priest to action is
called a <I>Hook</I>. To design an adventure around the priest character, the DM has to provide a
hook that will bring the priest into the adventure, and do so in such a way
that the adventure doesn't exclude the other player-characters.
<P></P>
The hook must address the priest in one of his priestly roles or duties. Below
we present a variety of hooks and approaches to this sort of adventure.
