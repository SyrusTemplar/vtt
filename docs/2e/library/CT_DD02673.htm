<P></P>
Most characters can make a single pummeling attack each round. Any character
can gain an extra pummeling attack each round by punching with both hands
(provided both hands are free). However, the character suffers the penalties for
attacking with two weapons (see <A HREF="DD02502.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02502.htm">Chapter Two</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">).
<P></P>
To make a pummeling attack, the character makes an attack roll vs. the
defender’s Armor Class. Pummeling damage and speed varies with the type of implement
used to pummel:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Small, soft objects (bare hands) inflict 1d2 points of damage; base speed is
fast.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Small, hard objects (mailed fists, mugs, weapon pommels) inflict 1d3 points of
damage; base speed is fast.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Large, soft objects (saddles, unconscious characters) inflict 1d4 points of
damage; base speed is slow.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Large, hard objects (chairs, small tables, sacks of coins) inflict 1d6 points
of damage; base speed is slow.
<P></P>
<P></P>
To be used as an improvised weapon, an object must weigh no more than one
third of the attacker’s maximum press score (from <A HREF="PHB_DD01426.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01426.htm">PHB</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, Table 1) and its greatest dimension can be no larger than half the
attacker’s height. For example, a Man-sized creature could wield a tall stool in a
pummeling attack, but not a stepladder or banquet table; common sense must apply.
<P></P>
A cestus (see <A HREF="DD02743.htm#aaef3fdd"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02743.htm#aaef3fdd">Chapter Seven</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">) is a special case. A character employing a cestus uses the pummeling
procedure but inflicts normal damage.
<P></P>
Strength bonuses to attack and damage rolls apply to all pummeling attacks.
<P></P>
There is no knockdown die for pummeling attacks. Instead, there is an opposed
Strength roll to see if the defender is knocked down. Modify the opposing
Strength scores as follows:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> 2-point bonus or penalty per size difference of the attacker versus the
defender;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> +1 for attacking with a large object;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> +1, +2, or +3 for a specialized, master, or grand master attacker.
<P></P>
<P></P>
The defender is knocked down if the attacker wins the opposed Strength roll.
If both Strength rolls succeed, the character who succeeds with the highest roll
is the winner. If the attacker fails her Strength roll, there is no knockdown
no matter what the defender rolls. If the defender fails her Strength roll,
there is no knockdown unless the attacker’s roll succeeds.
<P></P>
If a pummeling attack scores a critical hit, do not use the procedures in <A HREF="DD02709.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02709.htm">Chapter Six</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">. Instead, the defender must save vs. death or be knocked unconscious for 3d10
combat rounds. The attacker’s hit probability adjustment (from Table 1 in the <A HREF="PHB_DD02343.htm#650bcbb9"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD02343.htm#650bcbb9">PHB</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">) for Strength applies as a bonus or penalty to the saving throw. If the
attacker does not have a Strength score, determine the attacker’s effective Strength
using the formula found in <A HREF="DD02485.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02485.htm">Chapter Two</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> and apply the appropriate modifier from the <A HREF="PHB_DD02343.htm#650bcbb9"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="PHB_DD02343.htm#650bcbb9">PHB</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">.
