<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Character Class Restrictions </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Non-warrior characters are normally restricted by the rules dictating the
types of weapons they can acquire proficiencies for. However, by spending extra
character points for a weapon proficiency slot, a character can purchase a
proficiency that he would otherwise not be able to possess.
<P></P>
A rogue or a priest can acquire a proficiency for a weapon that is normally
restricted to a warrior-s use. One additional character point must be spent when
the slot is purchased-the slot will cost 4 points, instead of the 3 rogues and
priests usually pay.
<P></P>
A wizard can spend 2 additional character points to become proficient in a
weapon normally allowed to a priest or a rogue. If the wizard wishes to become
proficient with a weapon that is normally limited to fighters, however, he must
spend 3 extra character points.
<P></P>
For example, if a wizard wishes to purchase a proficiency in the short bow, he
must pay 5 character points (since the short bow can be used by a rogue, he
adds 2 points to his base cost of 3 character points per slot). If he wants to
learn to use the longbow, however, he-ll have to pay 3 extra character points
(for a total of 6), since this weapon is normally limited to warriors.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Using Weapon Proficiency Slots
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character can learn to use a weapon through several different means. Weapon
proficiency slots also can be used to acquire abilities in unarmed combat,
skill with shields, and advanced levels of proficiency such as weapon mastery or
weapon expertise.
<P></P>
There are varying levels of ability in weapons use described in the <I>Skills and Powers</I> rules. The lowest is nonproficiency, then weapon familiarity, weapon
proficiency, and weapon expertise. Characters can advance additionally through the
levels of weapon specialization, weapon mastery, and, ultimately, weapon grand
mastery. Primarily this progression is used by fighters, but characters of other
classes can advance to high levels of accomplishment by the expenditure of
additional character points.
