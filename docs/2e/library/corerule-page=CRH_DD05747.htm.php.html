   When a ranger is not adventuring, he still has plenty to do to keep busy. Some
of the more common ranger activities are described below.
<P></P>
   Most of a ranger's daily routine occurs off stage; that is, neither the player
nor the DM need keep a detailed record of what a ranger does between
adventures. However, a creative DM may use elements of a ranger's routine as the basis
for an adventure--while patrolling his territory, a ranger intercepts a goblin
who turns out to be a scout for an advancing army; or as a springboard for a
ranger to acquire a new follower--a bear rescued from poachers takes a liking to
the ranger. A ranger's routine might also generate encounters to introduce him
to important NPCs--the ranger provides first aid to a hunter who turns out to be
a powerful official in a prosperous kingdom; or gain him experience--the
ranger earns experience points by fighting a small forest fire.
<P></P>
   Of course, not every ranger regularly engages in all of these activities. A
ranger occupying an arctic territory doesn't have to worry much about forest
fires, while a Warden probably spends more of his time enforcing laws than a
Greenwood Ranger or Feralan. Still, the activities described here should give you a
good idea of how a typical ranger fills his day.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
   The ranger spends much of his free time patrolling his territory. He may
follow the same route every day, or he may wander wherever his fancy takes him. He
keeps an eye out for signs of trouble, such as eroded fields or withered plants,
and makes contact with other sentient residents, listening to their problems
or engaging in small talk. Some rangers ride mounts, particularly if they have a
lot of ground to cover, but most prefer to patrol on foot, which enables them
to traverse obstacles more easily, as well as minimizing the chance of drawing
attention to themselves. Though patrolling is necessary to keep abreast of the
condition of their territories, rangers also patrol for the sheer pleasure of
basking in the open air and savoring nature's splendor.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
   A ranger is ever-watchful for strangers in his territory. Followers or other
contacts may alert him to the presence of strangers, or he may become aware of
them himself by noticing disturbances in the terrain or observing them directly.
<P></P>
   In most cases, a ranger monitors strangers discretely, watching them from the
cover of trees or shadows, or requesting his followers to make regular reports
of their activities. Usually, a ranger can ascertain the intention of strangers
without ever making direct contact with them. Most turn out to be harmless
travelers or hunters who pose no threat to the ranger or his territory, and the
ranger leaves them alone.
<P></P>
   If a stranger's motives are more ambiguous--for instance, if he's chopping
down trees or hunting animals beyond his needs--the ranger will confront him,
politely but firmly inquiring about his intentions. Generally, the abrupt
appearance of an intimidating ranger, particularly if he's accompanied by a bear or two,
elicits immediate cooperation. If the stranger explains himself
satisfactorily, the ranger departs, perhaps implying that he'll be back if the stranger
doesn't keep his nose clean. Should the stranger resist the ranger's authority, the
ranger may take whatever actions he deems necessary to ensure compliance, using
violence as a last resort.
<P></P>
   However, physical confrontations are rare. More commonly, strangers require
directions, medical care, or advice. A ranger is usually willing to help,
especially if his assistance facilitates their leaving his territory more quickly. If
the strangers are lost, the ranger will point out the best route leading to
their desired destination. In some cases, he'll volunteer to guide them. Most
rangers have a rudimentary knowledge of first aid, and can bind sprained ankles,
splint bones, and attempt to resuscitate for drowning victims. A ranger can
explain which plants are edible and which are poisonous. He can direct strangers to
sources of fresh water, orchards of ripe fruit, and safe campsites.
<P></P>
   In return, the ranger may well insist that strangers clean up after
themselves, avoid disturbing local habitats, and preserve the natural beauty of the
environment. Those who violate the ranger's trust can expect a brisk escort out of
his territory.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Trailblazing
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
   A ranger who occupies an undeveloped wilderness must spend a fair amount of
time making and maintaining trails. Some of these trails may be permanent roads
or paths, usable by anyone traversing the ranger's territory. Other trails may
be known only to the ranger, concealed by dense woods or similar terrain. The
ranger and his followers use these concealed trails to get from place to place
while monitoring the movement of strangers. Although animals in their native
habitats are efficient trailmakers, the ranger may improve their trails by making
the footing safer, or linking feeding grounds, watering holes, grazing pastures,
and lairs.
<P></P>
   An effective trail system requires a thorough understanding of the land,
including the precise location of streams, hills, and other significant terrain
features. A ranger occupying a small territory may be able to hold this information
in his head. For larger regions, the ranger may need to keep maps. In this
case, a conscientious ranger will regularly review and update his maps, adding new
features and looking for discrepancies.
<P></P>
   Constructing a new trail begins with clearing debris and smoothing the ground.
This may involve cutting trees, pulling stumps, and filling in holes. If a
road passes though a valley or ravine, the ranger may have to dig ditches to
direct rainwater away from the trail. He may then need to plant grasses along the
roadside to prevent soil from washing into the ditches.
<P></P>
   Trail maintenance is an ongoing chore, requiring weeding in the spring and ice
removal in the winter. In exceptionally harsh climates, the ranger may have to
build snow fences, which are constructions of wood or stone that run parallel
to a trail. During blizzards, blowing snow piles up along the fence instead of
covering the trail.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
   A dutiful ranger looks after the interests of the wildlife in his territory.
He tracks down poachers and unprincipled hunters, relocates creatures that have
been displaced by natural disasters, and cares for young animals whose parents
have been killed. He notes fluctuations in animal populations and tries to
determine if an excess of predators (or prey) is only a temporary adjustment to
current conditions, or if it foreshadows a more serious problem. A sudden drop in
the number of songbirds or frogs, for instance, may indicate that the insects
they eat have been poisoned by some outside source.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Conservation
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
   A ranger is dedicated to the preservation of his environment. He uses timber,
water, and other natural resources judiciously and encourages others to do the
same. If he cuts a tree, he replaces it with a new seedling. If he raises herd
animals, he keeps them moving so as not to overgraze a pasture. If he farms, he
rotates his crops so as not to exhaust the soil, replacing the nutrients with
natural fertilizers.
<P></P>
   Unfortunately, the ranger must continually struggle against the carelessness
and greed of those who don't share his concerns. They strip the land of timber
and minerals, and level entire forests to build new cities. For commerce or
sport, they hunt scarce species to extinction. They relentlessly farm the same
acreage until the soil can no longer support crops, and dump raw sewage and other
waste products into lakes and rivers until the water is no longer fit to drink.
<P></P>
   The ranger employs several methods to counter this selfishness and
indifference. He educates travelers passing through his territory, demonstrating the
importance of proper waste disposal and the danger of smoldering camp fires. He
negotiates with local villages to regulate mining and farming, and to set aside
virgin forests and jungles as protected sanctuaries. In extreme situations, a
ranger may resort to guerilla tactics, such as sabotaging oppressive and ruinous
activities.
<P></P>
   A ranger must also be constantly vigilant for natural disasters. As prevention
is the key to effective disaster management, a ranger remains alert for the
earliest signs of trouble, taking immediate steps to intervene before the problem
becomes a full-blown catastrophe.
<P></P>
   Here are some the most common natural disasters a ranger might have to face:
<P></P>
  <B>Insects/Disease.</B> Infestations of beetles, locusts, aphids, and other insects can strip forests
and pastures in a matter of days or weeks. Molds and rusts can ravage
woodlands if unchecked. Old trees, which aren't as resistant to disease as younger
ones, are particularly vulnerable. To prevent the spread of destructive insects and
fungi, rangers remove and dispose of infested plants as quickly as possible.
<P></P>
   <B>Flood.</B> An excess of precipitation, sudden snowmelt, or high winds producing strong
coastal waves may result in flooding. Floods can wash away valuable topsoil,
destroy trees and buildings, and drown the unprepared. Rangers reduce the severity
of river flooding by planting and maintaining the trees and grasses in
elevated lands. This vegetation controls runoff and absorbs melted snow, preventing it
from running off into rivers and causing the water to rise over the
embankments. Ambitious rangers with leadership skills will sometimes coordinate the local
population to assist him building levees to contain rivers prone to flooding.
This must be handled with care, as such rivers can silt up, causing worse
problems later.
<P></P>
   Seacoast floods, on the other hand, are almost impossible to prevent. A
ranger's best strategy for dealing with them is to become familiar with the weather
patterns that precede them. With sufficient warning, a ranger can warn others to
seek protection in the highlands until the storm subsides.
<P></P>
   <B>Earthquake.</B> Violent shifting of the earth's inner layers may produce earthquakes, which
can occur anywhere in the world. Earthquakes can indirectly cause flooding and
fires, but the biggest danger comes from avalanches, falling rocks, trees,
mudslides, and collapsing buildings.
<P></P>
   As with seacoast floods, there's not much a ranger can do to prevent
earthquakes, but he can learn to recognize the signs that precede them. Unusual animal
behavior (such as the agitated prancing of small mammals), spontaneous geyser
eruptions, and clusters of small tremors often indicate an impending major
earthquake. While the warnings may not come long in advance, a forewarned ranger can
spread the word to head for plains or open fields, which may be safer havens in
the event of a major earthquake.
<P></P>
   <B>Drought.</B> Higher than average temperatures and a lack of rainfall may result in a
drought. When water is scarce, rivers dry up, vegetation withers, and animals suffer
from dehydration.
<P></P>
   Rangers can't accurately predict when droughts will occur. However, in regions
of irregular rainfall, he can check tree rings, which give an excellent
indicator of rain received in previous seasons. Thick rings occur in wet years, thin
rings in dry years. Since wet periods tend to alternate with dry periods,
studying the rings can help the ranger anticipate the next drought. A ranger can't
offset the overall effects of a drought, but he can reduce the local impact of
the drought on marginal habitats by storing water, and encouraging others to do
the same.
<P></P>
   <B>Fire.</B> Fires are perhaps the most devastating of all natural disasters. A fire not
only wipes out trees and vegetation, it also kills animals and pollutes lakes
and rivers with ash. Travelers who carelessly burn trash or toss unwanted torches
into the brush are a common source of fires. While lightning strikes are a
primary cause of forest fires, some fires are intentionally set by enemies.
<P></P>
   Rangers occupying forests or other territories susceptible to fire constantly
watch for smoke. Tall mountains make the best vantage point, but where
mountains are unavailable or where scaling them frequently is impractical, rangers may
construct lookout towers--simple platforms supported by long poles and nearby
trees. A rope or wood ladder gives the ranger access to the tower.
<P></P>
   Fighting fires isn't easy, nor is it something one ranger can effectively do
alone. Because fires spread so rapidly, particularly in dry seasons, a ranger's
chance of stopping a fire decreases with every moment it's allowed to burn.
Water or dirt can be used to smother small fires. If a ranger has prepared for
help beforehand, he can coordinate the building of a fireline--an area cleared of
all vegetation and other combustible material. This helps contain larger fires,
but an adequate fireline usually requires the efforts of many individuals
working as a team. Once a fire is extinguished, a close watch must still be kept
for many days, lest a smoldering limb start the fire blazing once again.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
   Certain rangers, such as Wardens and Sea Rangers, may be charged with
enforcing the laws of the local ruler. They arrest and punish poachers, patrol the
lands they guard, and sometimes negotiate land use agreements with farmers,
loggers, and others. If a royal decree protects a particular animal species, the
ranger may be charged with enforcing it. Some rangers have the authority to act as
judge and jury, allowing them to try cases on the spot and pass sentences as
they see fit. Fines may be levied for minor infractions, such as trespassing,
while more severe crimes, such as killing an animal from the king=s private stock
or picking fruit from the king's tree, may be punishable by death. In such
cases, the ranger will have a charter or royal writ from the ruler.
