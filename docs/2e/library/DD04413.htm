This potent spell affects all creatures hostile to the priest within the area
of effect. The Power granting the spell causes the spell's effects to manifest
in one of two ways: the Chaos variation or the Thought variation.
<P></P>
In the Chaos variation, the fabric of reality is altered to change events.
Magical items dysfunction because the fabric of magical reality is changed.
<P></P>
In the Thought variation, the thoughts of the victims of the spell are
distorted and altered so that they find themselves unable to function coherently and
effectively. Magical items dysfunction because the thoughts of their users are
warped to either convince them that the items cannot function or block thought
so that proper commands cannot be given.
<P></P>
The effects on the victims of the spell are the same for both variations. Each
round, there is a 50% chance that a degeneration effect will occur in the area
of effect. When this occurs, two events take place. First, spellcasters lose
one spell from each level of spell currently memorized (e.g., a spellcaster who
has memorized three spells each from levels 1 through 3 loses one spell from
each level for a total of three). Lost spells may be regained normally through
rest and memorization.
<P></P>
Second, magical items are affected in the following ways:
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">?</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Weapons and armor lose one level of enchantment (a <I>sword +</I>3 becomes a <I>sword +2</I>, etc.).
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">?</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Magical items that carry charges (wands, rods, staves, etc.) are drained of
1d10 charges.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">?</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Magical items without pluses or charges must make a saving throw versus spell
(using the saving throw of their owner) or become nonmagical.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">?</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Potions lose all magic and scrolls lose one randomly determined spell.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">?</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Permanent magical items (swords, boots, armor, etc.) temporarily lose all
effects until the spell expires or until the items leave the area of effect and for
1d10 rounds thereafter.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Single-use and charged items are permanently affected by this spell. A potion
destroyed by this spell remains useless even after the spell ends.
<P></P>
Within the area of effect, magical communication is impossible due to thought
blocks and chaotic effects. No communication magic (<I>ESP, sending</I>, etc.) will function; any spellcaster trying to cast such a spell will be
stunned for 1 round per level of the spell he attempts to cast. A <I>reverse</I> of the tongues spell operates continuously in the area of effect. Telepathic
communication (e.g., with a familiar) is also impossible.
<P></P>
In the Chaos variation of the spell, the center of the area of effect moves
10' per round. The direction is randomly determined using 1d8 roll and compass
points (1N, 2NE, 3E, 4SE, 5S, 6SW, 7W, 8NW). The radius of the spell effect will
never exclude the priest who cast the spell; re-roll any result that leads to
this occurrence.
