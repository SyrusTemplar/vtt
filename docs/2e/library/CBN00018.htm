</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Archetypal necromancers employ the Art only for their own twisted and evil
ends. They revel in animating the dead and forcing the corrupted remains to serve
their perverse appetites. Because of the Archetype's vile excesses,
necromancers as a profession are universally reviled in most civilized societies.
<P></P>
The Archetypal necromancer was perhaps best captured in the short stories of
Clark Ashton Smith. The decadent Mmatmuor and Sodosma from -The Empire of the
Necromancers,- powerful Vacharn, and his treacherous sons Vokal and Uldulla from
-Necromancy in Naat,- the vengeful Nathaire from -the Colossus of Ylourgne,-
and finally the perverted Abnon-Tha with his timid assistants, Narghai and
Vemba-Tsith, from -The Charnel God.- All these vile and repugnant personalities serve
to clearly illustrate the Archetype at its lowest form.
<P></P>
In more recent fantasy literature, Sauron (Tolkien's <I>Lord of the Rings</I>), Roxanne (the <I>Thieves? World</I> anthologies), and the Forsaken (Robert Jordan's <I>Wheel of Time</I> series) are good examples of this kit.
<P></P>
<B>Requirements:</B> The Archetype is the classic malevolent wizard (any evil alignment will do).
Black clothes are a must (or at the very least, some somber attire).
<P></P>
<B>Role: </B>Stereotypical necromancers are consummate villains, foul-hearted wizards of
the basest sort. As a result of their violently unrelenting and unrepentant evil,
these wizards are either promptly stamped out of existence by the righteous
arm of society, or they are eventually driven out of civilization into the
wilderness. Most tend to be short-sighted, petty scoundrels with few ambitions save
to capture unwary travelers, kill them in gruesome tortures, and later animate
them as a form of sick amusement. Others plot in seclusion to gain the coveted
boon of lichdom so they can prolong their depravity beyond the grave. The most
dangerous ones harbor secret, long-range plans to subvert or destroy the society
that exiled them.
<P></P>
The Archetype is an unsympathetic villain, and Master Pizentios (the cryptic
Master P. in Sarzec's letter at the beginning of this chapter) provides the DM
with an example of such a dastardly character. This wizard is featured in the
introductions of Chapters Seven and Eight, and his NPC sheet appears in Chapter
Nine. As we shall see in the sample campaign of the <A HREF="CBN00157.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="CBN00157.htm">Isle of the Necromancer Kings</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> (Chapter Nine), Pizentios makes a dangerous nemesis for even an experienced
party of adventurers.
<P></P>
<B>Preferred Spells:</B> An Archetype like Pizentios embraces the Black Arts, though much of the
wizard's notoriety arises from the perverted abuse of <A HREF="CBN00086.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="CBN00086.htm">gray necromancy</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> (which includes animating the dead-see Chapter Four). Otherwise, an Archetype
is a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to necromancy, adopting any (offensive)
spells which further his or her plans.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> The Archetype is generally limited much like a standard wizard and can
normally choose from among the dagger, dart, staff, knife, or sling. However, at the
discretion of the DM, these villainous wizards may learn a single special
weapon outside their restricted selection, at the expense of two slots. The
necromancers of Clark Ashton Smith, for instance, rarely traveled far without strapping
on their scimitars. The Archetype can learn only one special weapon, chosen
from among the following: battle axe, bow (any), crossbow (any), javelin, spear,
sword (any), and warhammer. While these are not normally allowed to wizard
characters, they tend to be common among Archetypes (especially at low levels).
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Required: none. Recommended: (General) any; (Warrior, these take 3 slots):
endurance, survival; (Rogue) any; (Wizard) anatomy, languages (ancient), ancient
history, necrology, netherworld lore, reading/writing, venom handling.
Forbidden: all Priest.
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> Archetypes may own any equipment, including a dagger, knife, dart, staff,
sling, or their chosen special weapon. Like all wizards, they cannot wear armor
when casting spells.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> Due to his or her devotion to black necromancy, the Archetype typically gains
1?3 special abilities as outlined in Chapter Two (DM's discretion). These
supernatural powers invariably result from the wizard's heinous practices, which
usually include foul and unspeakable pacts with evil gods.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> Most Archetypal necromancers pay a terrible personal price for their evil
powers. By embracing the Black Arts, they subject themselves to countless
dangerous side effects, the least of which include curses, disease, physical deformity,
and madness (the DM should refer to Chapter Three for details).
