The recipient of this spell gains the benefit of a <I>bless</I> spell (+1 to attack rolls and saving throws) and a special bonus of 1d8
additional hit points for the duration of the spell. The <I>aid</I> spell enables the recipient to actually have more hit points than his full
normal total. The bonus hit points are lost first when the recipient takes
damage; they cannot be regained by curative magic.
<P></P>
For example, a 1st-level fighter has 8 hit points, suffers 2 points of damage
(8-2 = 6), and then receives an <I>aid</I> spell that gives 5 additional hit points. The fighter now has 11 hit points,
5 of which are temporary. If he is then hit for 7 points of damage, 2 normal
hit points and all 5 temporary hit points are lost. He then receives a <I>cure light wounds</I> spell that heals 4 points of damage, restoring him to his original 8 hit
points.
<P></P>
Note that the operation of the spell is unaffected by permanent hit point
losses due to energy drain, Hit Die losses, the loss of a familiar, or the
operation of certain artifacts; the temporary hit point gain is figured from the new,
lower total.
<P></P>
The material components of this spell are a tiny strip of white cloth with a
sticky substance (such as tree sap) on the ends, plus the priest's holy symbol.
