All characters are automatically <I>familiar </I>with any weapon that is related to a weapon they are proficient in. Weapons
are considered to be related if they are part of the same tight group. For
example, a character who is proficient in the use of the light crossbow is
automatically familiar with all other types of crossbow because they-re part of the same
tight weapon group.
<P></P>
Familiarity is not as good as proficiency, but it beats not knowing anything
about a weapon at all. Characters only suffer one-half the normal nonproficiency
penalty when attacking with weapons they are familiar with. They may attempt
any normal attack maneuvers possible (the familiarity penalty still applies, of
course), and suffer no initiative or rate of fire penalties.
<P></P>
Familiarity does <I>not </I>allow the user to make use of any special weapon attack modes that require
proficiency in the weapon.
