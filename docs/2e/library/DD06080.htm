<B>Description:</B> Spells of this school focus magical energies to provide protection. This
protection can take a number of forms, including warding off specific types of
weapons or creatures and discouraging or dispelling enemies. The school also
includes a variety of spells involving avoidance and repellence. Abjuration spells
concentrate on eliminating or hindering sources of potential harm rather than
repairing damage.
<P></P>
<B>Specialist Name:</B> Abjurer.
<P></P>
<B>Allowed Races:</B> Only humans can be abjurers. It's speculated that the natural magical
resistance of elves, half-elves, and gnomes prevents them from mastering abjuration
spells.
<P></P>
<B>Ability Requirements:</B> A wizard must have strong intuition and exceptional willpower to master
abjuration spells as reflected in a high Wisdom score. Specialists in this school
must have a minimum Wisdom of 15.
<P></P>
<B>Saving Throw Modifiers:</B> All opponents modify their saving throws by -1 when attempting to save
against an abjuration spell cast by an abjurer. An abjurer adds a +1 bonus when
saving against abjuration spells.
<P></P>
<B>Bonus Spells and Acquired Powers:</B> An abjurer can memorize an extra spell at each spell level, providing that at
least one of the memorized spells is from the school of abjuration; thus, a
1st-level abjurer can memorize two spells. When an abjurer reaches 17th level, he
acquires immunity to all forms of <I>hold</I> spells and adds a +1 bonus when saving against poison, paralyzation, and
death magic. When an abjurer reaches 20th level, his mastery of magical protective
forces has become so powerful that his Armor Class is raised from 10 to 9. He
is still forbidden to wear armor.
<P></P>
<B>Oppositional Schools:</B> An abjurer cannot learn spells from the schools of alteration and illusion.
<P></P>
<B>Spell Analysis:</B> The abjurer has a limited number of spells from which to choose, particularly
in the lower levels. This lack of options makes low-level abjurers among the
weakest of beginning wizards. To compensate, he should acquire a few low-level
spells from other available schools as early in his career as possible.
Offensive spells-- that is, spells that inflict damage-- from the school of alteration
are especially good choices, such as<I> burning hands, shocking grasp, strength</I>, and <I>Melf's minute meteors</I>. As he reaches higher levels of ability and is able to take advantage of the
more powerful abjuration spells available to him, an abjurer should become less
dependent on spells from other schools.
<P></P>
There are three general types of abjuration spells: protective, dispelling,
and dismissal. Protective spells include those that offer protection from
creatures (such as <I>protection from evil</I>), those that protect against weapons (such as <I>protection from normal missiles</I>), and those that protect against certain types of magic (such as <I>minor globe of invulnerability</I>). Dispelling spells cause the elimination of specific magical effects, such as<I> dispel magic</I> and <I>remove curse</I>. Dismissal spells cause the removal of certain creatures, such as <I>dismissal</I> and <I>banishment</I>.
<P></P>
Since the most effective abjurations are those offering the greatest
protection, it seems that the dismissal spells are the most desirable-- after all, they
get rid of the attacker altogether. However, dismissal spells are effective
only against very specific types of attackers, such as<I> banishment 's</I> dismissal of extraplanar creatures. Unless the wizard anticipates
encountering the type of creature affected, a <I>dismissal </I>spell won't be helpful. Since protection spells usually affect only a single
individual, the best all-purpose abjurations are the dispelling spells; <I>dispel magic</I> for instance, employed against a magic-wielding enemy protects not only the
caster, but the entire party.
<P></P>
The abjurer is at a disadvantage when attacking. There are very few abjuration
spells that inflict damage either directly or indirectly. But in terms of
defensive capabilities, the abjurer is second to none. When a party is exploring
potentially dangerous territory, the abjurer makes an ideal point man, placing
him in an excellent position to create defenses against attackers. The abjurer,
like all wizards, has a poor Armor Class, making him extremely vulnerable to
damage. A comrade with a lot of hit points and a low AC should accompany the
abjurer near the front of the party, ready to intercept attacks and act as the
abjurer's bodyguard.
<P></P>
Abjurers also operate well in conjunction with other wizards. While the
abjurer casts magical defenses, a fellow wizard can concentrate on creating magical
offenses. When traveling, abjurers make good guards for helpless NPCs, such as
small children and elderly citizens. Does the party have a treasure map, a
valuable gem, or other prized possession? With his repertoire of protective spells,
the abjurer may be the best person to carry them.
<P></P>
<B>Most Desirable Spells:</B> Low-Level: <I>Dispel magic</I> is not only the best of the low-level abjuration spells, it should be a part
of any wizard's arsenal (excluding, of course, those specialists to whom
abjuration is forbidden). <I>Dispel magic</I> can effectively disarm many opponents, and it can also negate harmful or
potentially harmful magical devices. Abjurers would do well to acquire this spell
early in their careers. <I>Protection from evil</I> is another useful spell, considering how often a typical party encounters
evil creatures and evil NPCs. Of the two 3rd-level protection spells, an abjurer
will likely find<I> protection from evil, 10' radius</I> to be more helpful than<I> protection from normal missiles</I>, since he will probably have more opportunities to use the former than the
latter. Note that <I>protection from normal missiles</I> can be extremely helpful when traveling through primitive areas where the
inhabitants are more likely to use rocks and spears than swords and maces. Medium-Level:<I> Fire trap</I> not only offers superb protection, it's one of the few abjuration spells
capable of inflicting damage. Avoidance has the twin advantages of being reversible
and permanent.<I> Anti-magic shell</I> is generally preferable to <I>globe of invulnerability</I>; not only does it last longer, it's stronger and takes less time to cast.
<P></P>
High-Level:<I> Spell turning</I> and <I>Serten's spell immunity</I> are extremely powerful spells that should be useful in any hostile
environment. In most situations, <I>prismatic sphere</I> is the best high-level abjuration spell; it not only provides a variety of
defenses, it is also capable of blinding most opponents and inflicting a sizeable
amount of damage.
<P></P>
<B>Ethos:</B> Concerned with protection, abjurists have a deep reverence for life and are
attracted to philosophies stressing compassion and selflessness. Accordingly,
most abjurers are of good alignment. Evil-aligned abjurers are often toadies of
an intimidating evil warrior or in the service of a more powerful wizard of
another school. Abjurers tend to be thoughtful, orderly, gentle-natured, and
soft-spoken, going out of their way not to attract attention.
<P></P>
Of all the wizards, abjurers seem to have the strongest family ties. Abjurers
take comfort in the security of marriage and often choose their mates at an
early age; many abjurers have ten or more offspring. Owing to their mastery of
protective forces, abjurers tend to live to a ripe old age; it's not unusual to
find abjurers well into their eighties in adventuring parties.
<P></P>
Abjurers make their homes anywhere, but prefer small villages to large cities.
Because of their kind hearts and generous spirits, abjurers are held in high
esteem by society in general. Abjurers commonly earn a living as guides,
bodyguards, merchants, and teachers
