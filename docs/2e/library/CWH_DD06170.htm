In a world where magic has a bad reputation, a PC wizard might want to join an
adventuring party to prove that magic can be used as a force of good. If the
party's mission is successful and the wizard is at least partly responsible,
magic might once again be accepted as a respectable and honorable profession.
<P></P>
There are any number of situations incorporating this idea:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> The PC wizard wants to confront an influential ruler in a distant land who is
responsible for spreading propaganda about the inherent evil of magic. The
ruler might be an evil wizard, bent on stirring up support from the populace to
stamp out rival wizards. He could also be of good alignment, but a bad experience
with magic as a youth left him prejudiced against all wizards.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> The PC wizard wants to learn how many wizards still exist in the world.
Perhaps many wizards have gone into hiding, and the PC wizard is determined to find
out
<P></P>
what has happened to them.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> The PC wizard wants to discover how many young people are interested in
learning magical skills. Perhaps the PC wizard wishes to establish a magical academy
of his own, or perhaps he wishes to find a young novice with whom he can share
his knowledge. Are such students difficult to find? If so, why? Will the PC
wizard face resistance from the family of a potential student? From the local
authorities? What must the PC wizard do to prove that his intentions are
honorable?
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> The PC wizard wants to verify rumors that a violent feud has erupted between
two organizations of wizards in a distant land, thus sullying the reputations of
wizards everywhere. The rival wizard groups might be of different alignments,
members of oppositional schools, or from different races. Their feud might be
over a contested piece of land or a landmark-- such as a tower or cemetery-- or
one group might have religious objections to the type of spells used by the
other group. Settling their disagreements can be used as a springboard for new
adventures.
