The DM might decide that all magic in his world stems from a particular
culture; therefore, all wizards must have the same kit. This includes player
character wizards and well as NPC wizards of all alignments. Among the kits especially
appropriate for this type of campaign are the Amazon, the Anagakok, and the Wu
Jen. If the DM wishes, player characters of all classes might be required to
take the same kit, but this is not necessary for an interesting campaign.
<P></P>
How this type of campaign affects the existence of magical items and magical
monsters is the decision of the DM, but there are likely to be fewer of both
(see <I>Worlds With Low Amounts of Magic </I>in the Magic in the Campaign World section above). In a campaign where all
magic comes from an Amazon culture, all magical items will have their origin in
that culture. Dragons, for instance, may exist throughout the world, but all of
them trace a common ancestry to a land dominated by Amazons.
