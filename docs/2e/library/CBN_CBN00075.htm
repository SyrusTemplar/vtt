</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Just as physical deformity has been associated with villainy, physical
sickness and disease have been historically interpreted as a form of divine
retribution. Of course, mass outbreaks of plague and pestilence—which decimated both the
good and evil—can be cited to refute such superstitions, but still such beliefs
remained, even in the face of rational observation.
<P></P>
In addition to its supernatural origins, disease could just as easily result
from a necromancer’s plundering of the dead or contact with rotting corruption
and filth. A necromancer might also gain a sickness after exposure to certain
undead (like a mummy), cursed magical items (such as a <I>staff of withering</I>), and spells (like <I>cause disease</I> and <I>plague curse</I>). The risk of disease also threatens wizards who tamper with black
necromancy. Wizard spells that by their very nature inflict disease on others (such as <I>contagion</I> or <I>mummy touch</I>) might have some form of unforeseen side effect on the caster.
<P></P>
In game terms, whenever you feel a necromancer has placed his or her health at
risk by investigating an especially filthy, moldering crypt (or perhaps
casting a disease-producing spell), have the character make a <I>disease check</I>—simply a constitution check subject to the modifiers on <A HREF="CBN00077.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="CBN00077.htm">Table 8</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">. Disease checks should also be required for PCs, though only for special
circumstances, such as exploring major tombs or searching a large number of rotting
bodies.
<P></P>
Normally, if a character fails a disease check, symptoms of an ailment (such
as dizziness, nausea, fever, or coughs) emerge within 13–24 hours. Characters
with the healing nonweapon proficiency can allow an afflicted individual to make
second disease check, this time with a +2 bonus. Unless <I>cure disease</I> is available from a priest or paladin, the full force of the affliction
descends upon the unfortunate victim in 1–4 days.
<P></P>
However, in the special case of a failed powers check, a necromancer is not
entitled to a disease check and succumbs to the ravages of an illness within 1–6
turns of attracting the baneful attention of the patron god. Usually, the
corresponding Dark Gift is only bestowed after the character suffers through the
disease. This severe, divinely imposed affliction may not be treated by a
character with the healing nonweapon proficiency, and <I>cure disease</I> will only be effective if cast by a priest of a greater level of experience
than the necromancer suffering from the ailment.
