the Greater Gods. He often travels the worlds looking for mischief to get into.
He appears as a gold-skinned gnome with gemstone eyes that shift from sapphire
to emerald to ruby.
<P></P>
A master of pranks, Garl is a good-humored jokester who is nevertheless proud
and protective of his diminutive followers. His chief concerns are twofold: to
see that gnomes every where cooperate and work together and to remind them that
while life may sometimes be hard, it's important to always keep a sense of
humor.
<P></P>
Garl carries his intelligent two-headed axe, Arumdina, every where he goes;
she is more a companion than a possession. Although he is a capable fighter, he
prefers to use trickery and illusions to accomplish his goals, and encourages
his followers to do the same.
