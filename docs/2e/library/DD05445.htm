?? Second in prestige only to the Order of the Radiant Heart, the Order of the
Thorn recognizes service to a church. Membership is extended to those
demonstrating exemplary courage in defense of religious principles or church property.
Largely an honorary organization, members have no responsibilities other than
counseling their congregations and helping church leaders interpret religious
doctrine.
<P></P>
<B>?? Requirements:</B> A candidate must have two sponsors: an official of his church (a priest of
8th level or higher), and an active member of the order. Once accepted into the
order, a member must tithe an extra 10% of his income to the church that
sponsored him. This in addition to his normal tithe.
<P></P>
?? <B>Organization:</B> Each chapter has 12 members, and will consider new candidates only when an
active member dies or steps down. A chapter has a single High Officer, called a
Rector, nominated by a committee of church leaders, then approved by a vote of
the membership. To acknowledge his position, the Rector wears a velvet sash
around his neck bearing the order's symbol.
<P></P>
?? <B>Emblem: </B>A long-stemmed rose.
<P></P>
<B>?? Motto:</B> &quot;Faith is the mother of duty and the father of truth.&quot;
<P></P>
<B>?? Benefits:</B> A Thorn member receives a +2 bonus to his reaction rolls from all lawful and
neutral NPCs instead of the normal +1 bonus. Each member has a private prayer
cell in his church, used for reflection and meditation. When he dies, his
helmet, sword, and coat of arms are placed in the cell as a memorial.
<P></P>
<B>?? Dismissal:</B> Standard.
