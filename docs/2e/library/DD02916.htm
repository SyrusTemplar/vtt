legs, and harsh mannerisms. A goblin?s face is broad and flat, with a wide
fang-filled mouth, pointed ears, and an olive or dull yellow coloration. Goblins are
generally cowardly, opportunistic, and untrustworthy.

Goblin society is fairly savage, and each tribe has an exact pecking order.
Moving up this ladder by pulling down those above them is the typical dream of
most goblins, and cooperation with others of their kind is always halfhearted.
Typically, a goblin will let others do his work or fighting for him any time he
can, and then strike from ambush only after he?s sure his enemies have been
weakened to the point where they can?t threaten him. Or, if the wrong side is
winning the fight, a goblin isn?t above reevaluating his allegiances in the middle
of a battle.
