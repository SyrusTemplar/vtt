A <I>vortex</I> is a swirling mass of magical energy, barely controllable by the caster. On
the round of casting, a small sparkle of lights fills the air at the desired
position. On the second round, a 7'-tall, multicolored tornado appears. From this
moment on, the caster must maintain concentration in order for the <I>vortex</I> to remain.
<P></P>
Each round, the caster can move the <I>vortex</I> 60 feet. However, control of direction is not perfect. The caster has
complete control over distance, but can only suggest the desired direction. The caster
has a 50% chance of moving the <I>vortex</I> in the direction he desires; if the die roll indicates failure, the <I>vortex</I> moves according to the scatter diagram for grenade-like missiles. Thus, the <I>vortex</I> usually moves in the general direction desired, but on occasion, it may move
to either side or directly toward the caster.
<P></P>
The <I>vortex</I> cannot pass through objects larger than its area of effect (it could move
through a sapling but not an ancient oak tree) and will be redirected by these,
rebounding along the general line of movement. For example, if cast in a narrow
hallway, the <I>vortex</I> might ricochet down the hall, bouncing from side to side.
<P></P>
The <I>vortex</I> is composed of raw magical energy. Nonmagical creatures struck by the <I>vortex</I> suffer 1d4 points of damage per level of the caster. Magical creatures and
spellcasters suffer 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster. Creatures
struck are allowed a saving throw vs. magic to suffer only half damage.
<P></P>
Each time a creature is struck, there is a 5% chance that the <I>vortex</I> will explode in a wild surge. Use <A HREF="DD04136.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD04136.htm">Table 2</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> to determine the results of any wild surge. If the <I>vortex </I>causes a wild surge, the spell ends immediately.
<P></P>
The material components are a silk streamer and a handful of straw.
