<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Warden</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Description:</B> The Warden works for
a noble, king, or wealthy land-owner, and is charged with managing
and protecting a tract of land owned by his overlord. He keeps his
overlord's land free of monsters, guards against spies and
trespassers, intervenes when natural disasters occur, and sees to the
welfare of the animal population. While a Warden may operate alone,
making decisions as he sees fit, he ultimately answers to a higher authority.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Areas overseen by Wardens vary by size
and geography, depending on their overlords' holdings and interests.
A Warden may be in charge of a game reserve or oversee a parcel of
farmland. He may supervise a private park, or be responsible for
undeveloped property in the mountains or desert. The size of a
guarded land may range from a few square miles for Wardens just
beginning their careers, to vast estates for high-level Wardens.
Generally, as a Warden's experience increases, so do the boundaries
of the land he supervises.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Requirements:</B> As a representative
of a greater lord, a Warden is required to deal diplomatically with a
variety people from all walks of life. Therefore, a Warden must have
a minimum Charisma of 12. A Warden cannot be of chaotic alignment.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Primary Terrain</B>: Any, though
Forest and Plains are the most common. The primary terrain should
correspond to the area the Warden is first assigned to supervise.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Role:</B> In most societies, Wardens
occupy positions of modest status, comparable to those of mid-level
bureaucrats or well-to-do merchants. Some are members of the
military, but more often, they're aides to government officials or
affluent civilians. Wardens tend to hold the same job for life.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A Warden serves his lord with the loyalty
of a good soldier. He tends to be fastidious in his behavior and
strictly law-abiding, which also makes him a bit inflexible. To most
Wardens, rules are rules, and there's not much middle ground.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; When an adventuring party enters a
Warden's guarded area, he may agree to assist them for the sake of
expediency; the sooner the party leaves his area, the sooner things
will get back to normal. Conversely, a Warden may seek out a party to
help with a particularly difficult task, such as ridding the guarded
area of destructive creatures or locating a treatment for a crop
disease. Depending on the circumstances, a Warden may journey
anywhere in the world; he is not bound to remain in his guarded area.
However, a Warden will not undertake any adventure without direct
orders from, or with the express permission of his overlord.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Other members of an adventuring party may
find a Warden to be cordial but distant. A Warden's loyalties lie
primarily with his overlord, not with his companions, and this can
create stress for party members who insist on comradeship. Some
Wardens are also prone to homesickness; the further an expedition
takes him from his guarded area, the more anxious and sullen he may become.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, a Warden's dedication and
 professionalism can only enhance a party's effectiveness. Many comply
unwaveringly with orders from the party leader, offer pointed advice
when needed, and fight courageously on the battlefield.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Armorer,
Bowyer/Fletcher, Farmer, Forester, Groom, Weaponsmith, Woodworker/Carver.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Recommended:</I>
Bow (any), crossbow (any), quarterstaff, pole arm (any), spear, sword (any).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Recommended:</I>
Agriculture, Carpentry, Engineering, Etiquette, Falconry*, Heraldry,
Hunting, Languages (Modern), Reading/Writing, Riding (Land-based),
Stone Masonry.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Wardens have no
special armor or equipment requirements. Depending on the affluence
and generosity of the overlord, Wardens may have access to the finest
equipment money can buy, such as gem-studded shields and onyx-tipped
arrows. As a rule, Wardens take meticulous care of their gear,
spending much of their free time honing their blades to razor-edge
sharpness, and polishing their armor until it gleams like silver.
Wardens affiliated with the government may wear elaborate uniforms
emblazoned with medals, ribbons, and other service commendations.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Species Enemy:</B> Any, though the
species enemy is often a creature that plagues the Warden's guarded
land or torments his overlord (in human lands, this is likely to be brigands).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Followers:</B> Any.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Special Benefits:</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Stipend:</I> A Warden in good standing
with his overlord receives a monthly stipend commensurate with his
responsibilities and experience. Warden salaries average 30-50 gp per
month, plus a monthly bonus of 10 gp times the Warden's level.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Expenses:</I> When undertaking an
expedition on behalf of his overlord, the Warden may receive a small
stipend to cover his expenses. A typical stipend ranges from 100-500
gp, depending on the length of the expedition, the level of the
Warden, and the generosity of the overlord. The Warden may spend
these funds only on goods and services directly relating to the
success of the expedition. In lieu of money, the Warden may receive
loan of a mount, weapons, or equipment necessary for the undertaking.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Annual Boon:</I> Once per year, the
Warden can ask the overlord for a boon. It is traditional that this
be granted insofar as the resources of the overlord (and the
judgement of the DM) allow, although exceptionally greedy or
ill-considered requests will reflect badly upon the Warden.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Reaction Bonus: When representing his
overlord, a Warden receives a +2 bonus to his reaction checks with
all good and neutral characters of high social status (including
aristocrats, government officials, and affluent citizens), regardless
of their culture or whether he's met them before.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Special Hindrances:</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Accountability:</I> A Warden is held
fully accountable for any actions that may reflect badly on his
overlord. Should the Warden break the law, insult a noble, or
otherwise behave improperly, his overlord will demand an explanation.
An unsatisfactory explanation will result in a reprimand at best, and
termination of his job at worst. A terminated Warden is forced to
abandon this kit, suffering all of the penalties described in the
Abandoning Kits section elsewhere in this chapter.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If a Warden receives expenses (as
detailed in his Special Benefits), he must make a full accounting of
his expenditures and return any excess funds at the conclusion of his
expedition. Should a discrepancy be discovered, the Warden may be
fined or imprisoned. If he's been given special equipment instead of
or in addition to expenses, all items must be returned in good
condition. Otherwise, money may be deducted from the Warden's stipend
to replace them, or the overlord may confiscate an equivalent amount
of the Warden's goods.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Overlord Demands:</I> A Warden is
always subject to orders from his overlord. Some orders are critical,
others trivial, but all must be followed in order for the Warden to
remain in good standing. Failure to comply with an order may result
in a variety of penalties, ranging from fines to termination of employment.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; An overlord may require the Warden to
carry out a special order in conjunction with his primary assignment,
or a Warden may receive burdensome duties as part of his regular job.
In all cases, the DM decides when the overlord makes a special
demand, the type of demand, and the penalties for violation. Some
sample demands of a Warden:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> When an expedition
takes the Warden far from home, he must take along a young relative
of the overlord who wants to see the world. The Warden accepts
responsibility for the relative's safety and behavior.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> While on an
expedition to a distant land, the Warden must make contact with a
long-lost friend of his overlord and extend an invitation to visit.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> At all times and
wherever he goes, the Warden must display a banner bearing the
insignia of his overlord.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> In times of
austerity for the overlord, the Warden must turn over some or all of
the treasure he collects on an adventure.</FONT></P>
