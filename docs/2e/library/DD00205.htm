One of the great temptations for players is to create super characters. While
this is not true of every player all the time, the desire for power above
everything else afflicts most players at one time or another.
<P></P>
Many players see their characters as nothing more than a collection of numbers
that affects game systems. They don't think of their characters as
personalities to be developed. Players like this want to &quot;win&quot; the game. These players are
missing out on a lot of fun.
<P></P>
If players are creating new characters for your campaign, you probably won't
have to deal with such super characters. Players can start with ability scores
greater than 18 only if the race grants a bonus, but this is extremely rare.
Later in the campaign, magic might raise ability scores higher.
<P></P>
The greatest difficulty occurs when a player asks to bring in a character from
another campaign where characters are more powerful. Unless you are prepared
to handle them, super characters can seriously disrupt a campaign: Players with
average characters gradually become bored and irritated as the powerful
characters dominate the action. And players with powerful characters feel held back by
their weaker companions. None of this contributes to harmony and cooperation
among the characters or the players.
<P></P>
Cooperation is a key element of role-playing. In any group of player
characters, everyone has strengths to contribute and weaknesses to overcome. This is the
basis for the adventuring party--even a small group with sufficiently diverse
talents can accomplish deeds far greater than its size would indicate.
<P></P>
Now, throw in a character who is an army by himself. He doesn't need the other
characters, except perhaps as cannon fodder or bearers. He doesn't need
allies. His presence alone destroys one of the most fundamental aspects of the
game--cooperation.
