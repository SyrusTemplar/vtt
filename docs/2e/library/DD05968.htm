One common problem for the thief attempting to hide in shadows is the glint of
a steel weapon in moonlight, torchlight, and the like. The way to avoid this
is to use weaponblack, a thick, oil-based emulsion. Weaponblack can be coated on
to any metal surface and renders it almost completely matte black and
reflection-free. If the DM wishes, use of weaponblack can give the thief a +5% bonus to
hide in shadows. A superior rule, though, is that use of this substance saves
the thief having to make a second hide in shadows roll if he draws a weapon
while hiding, or saves him from any penalty modifier if he has a weapon already
drawn when he attempts to hide in shadows initially.

Once the weapon has actually struck a blow, the weaponblack will be wiped off.
Because it is oil-based, it is also highly flammable. If ignited it will burn
brightly, turning the weapon into the equivalent of a <I>flametongue</I> (although it does not count as a magical weapon) for 1d4+1 rounds. if the
thief is not protected from fire (e.g., with a <I>ring of fire resistance</I>) he suffers 1d4 points of damage per round while holding the weapon.
