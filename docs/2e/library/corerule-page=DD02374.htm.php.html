<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Every character in a fight is represented by a
miniature, stand-up, or marker of some kind. Figures show the
location of every creature in the battle and also show the <I>facing</I>
of each creature. In melee scale, one Man-sized creature fills one
square on the map.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">In any fight, facing is very important. It&#146;s hard
to punch someone standing behind you unless you turn around. Each
figure or marker on the battle map should have an obvious front
facing. For miniatures in strange poses, everyone should agree
beforehand what direction is the front of figure. &#147;This figure
faces the square his sword is pointing at&#148; is good enough.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">All figures have <I>front, flank, </I>and <I>rear</I>
spaces. The three spaces in front of a figure are its front spaces,
the two spaces directly beside it are flank spaces, and the three
spaces behind it are rear spaces. Facings can be at the side of a
square or at the corner (</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02374.htm.php.html#26691f7e">see

<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Normally, characters can only attack enemies in their
front spaces and gain attack bonuses when they attack an enemy&#146;s
flank or rear.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">There are two situations where more than one figure
can occupy a single square: grappled figures are both in the
defender&#146;s square, and characters in close order (</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02514.htm.php.html">see
Chapter Two</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) can fit two figures to
a single square. If there is more than one figure in a square, each
figure has the same front, flank, and rear spaces; no one is
considered to be in the left side of the space, or the back of the
space, or whatever.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Tiny (Size T) creatures can fit an unlimited number in
one square, although it would be unusual for more than 10 to be in
one space unless they were insect-sized.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Figures that are smaller than Man-sized (Size S)
normally occupy one square each, but if space is tight they&#146;ll
fight two to a square with no penalty. Small creatures in close order
can fit three figures in a square.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Large (size L) creatures normally occupy one space on
the map. They can fight in close order simply by occupying adjacent spaces.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Huge (size H) creatures occupy two to four spaces on
the map, depending on their size and shape. Humanoids such as giants
and ettins are two squares wide, creating an extra front space and an
extra rear space. Horse-like or serpentine creatures have a narrow
front and a long body, creating two extra flank spaces. Block-like or
massive creatures occupy a four-space square.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Gargantuan (Size G) creatures occupy at least six
spaces. They can be even bigger if the DM decides that the
creature&#146;s proportions are truly immense. A dragon with a
40-foot body could take up a block of spaces two wide and eight long!
Gargantuan creatures define front, flank, and rear spaces so that
roughly one-third of the adjacent squares fall into each category.</FONT></P>
