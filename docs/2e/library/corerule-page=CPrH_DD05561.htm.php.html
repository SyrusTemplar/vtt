This god is very much like the deity of arts (see <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD05533.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD05533.htm.php.html">Arts</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, above), but concerns himself with reading, writing, recitation, the
chronicling of history, and the teaching of youth. Lesser gods of this attribute would
involve themselves with only one of the above aspects.
<P></P>
The god's priesthood is primarily interested in the education of the young in
reading and writing, and the promotion and support of writers and poets in
their culture.

The god of literature and poetry is as likely to be male as female.

Crafts, Culture, Divinity of Mankind, Light, Metalwork, Music/Dance, Sun, and
Wisdom.

nonweapon proficiency. The priest may take the following on adventures: Three
priests (only one of whom may be third-level), one fighter, and four Normal Men
and Women of his choice. The priesthood will pay for half of the cost of
stronghold construction at 8th level. The stronghold must act as a meeting-place for
