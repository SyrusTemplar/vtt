There are three rules governing the thief kits:
<P></P>
1. A character may only take one thief kit.
<P></P>
<P></P>
2. You can only take a thief kit for your character when you first create that
character.
<P></P>
<P></P>
(This rule has one exception: If DM and players decide to integrate these
rules with an existing campaign, and both DM and players can agree on which thief
kit would be appropriate for each existing character, then you may use these
rules to add a thief kit to existing characters.)
<P></P>
<P></P>
3. Once you've selected a thief kit, you cannot change it.
<P></P>
<P></P>
(Note, however, that with the flexible way that thieves advance, you can do a
lot to make your thief look as if its kit has been changed. For instance, a
Fence may be stuck in the wilderness and not be able to follow his &quot;vocation&quot; for
years. But even so, he could not switch to a new kit, such as Scout.)

Before choosing a thief kit, you will already have determined the character's:
ability scores (AD&amp;D <I>Player's Handbook</I>, <A HREF="PHB_DD01421.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01421.htm">Chapter 1</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">), race (<A HREF="PHB_DD01438.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01438.htm">Chapter 2</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">), <A HREF="PHB_DD01456.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01456.htm">class</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> (presumably <A HREF="PHB_DD01500.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01500.htm">thief</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">), and alignment (<A HREF="PHB_DD01515.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01515.htm">Chapter 4</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). You might also have decided upon a host of background factors, as discussed
elsewhere in this book.
<P></P>
You are then ready to choose your thief kit. In fleshing your character out
along with the thief kit, you will probably encounter the various other stages of
character creation, such as proficiencies (<A HREF="PHB_DD01522.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01522.htm">Chapter 5</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> of the<I> Player's Handbook</I>, and Chapter 2 of this volume), money and equipment (<I>Player's Handbook</I>, <A HREF="PHB_DD01610.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01610.htm">Chapter 6</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">), and so forth.
