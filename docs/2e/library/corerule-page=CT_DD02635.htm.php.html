</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Specializing in a melee weapon provides a character with two main benefits:
first of all, he gains a +1 bonus to attack rolls and a +2 bonus to damage rolls
with that weapon; secondly, he gains an extra attack once per two rounds. A
1st-level fighter normally attacks once per round, but a 1st-level long sword
specialist attacks three times per two rounds.
