<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Drums of Panic:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">These kettle drums, hemispheres about 1? feet in diameter, come in pairs and
are unremarkable in appearance. If both of the pair are sounded, all creatures
within 120 feet (with the exception of those within a &quot;safe zone'' of 20 feet
radius from the drums) must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or turn and
move directly away from the sound for one full turn.
<P></P>
Each turn thereafter, panicked creatures may attempt to save vs. spell again.
Each failure brings another turn of movement away from the <I>drums of panic.</I> Movement is at the fastest possible speed while fleeing in panic, and three
rounds of rest are required for each turn of fast movement after the saving
throw is made. Creatures with an Intelligence of 2 roll saving throws -2 with
penalties, and those with 1 or less roll with -4 penalties.
