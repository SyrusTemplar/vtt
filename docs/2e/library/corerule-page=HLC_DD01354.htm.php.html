This rule allows the DM to change a character’s saving throw number based on
the levels or Hit Dice of the spellcaster and the target. Targets that are
weaker than the spellcaster have worse saving throws than targets that are stronger,
as shown on <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01353.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01353.htm.php.html">Table 36</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">.

that is not a spell or spell-like ability from a creature or a device use the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01724.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01724.htm.php.html">standard saving throw tables</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, not table 36. Rods, staves, wands, and other magical devices use the column
from Table 36 that is closest to their effects. A <I>fireball </I>from a <I>wand of fire </I>uses the spell column, a paralyzation beam from a <I>wand of paralyzation </I>uses the paralyzation or death magic column, and so on. The type of device
determines the attacker’s level, since the wielder’s level or Hit Dice is
irrelevant when a device is used, as shown on <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01356.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01356.htm.php.html">Table 37</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">.

During play, the DM should be careful to conceal the attacker’s true level of
power. That is, do not say, “Okay, the caster is four levels higher than the
thief, so your saving throw number against the spell is an 11.” Simply tell the
players what the attack form is and then inform them if their characters succeed
or fail based on their adjusted rolls.
