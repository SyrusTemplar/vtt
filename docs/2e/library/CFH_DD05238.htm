With the Pin maneuver, you move close to your enemy (right up in his face) and
use either a weapon or your shield to pin, or trap, his weapon—usually by
pressing it against him so that he can't move.
<P></P>
This is like a Called Shot, except that you <I>don't have to announce it before initiative</I> and you don't suffer a +1 to initiative. You do still suffer the –4 attack
penalty.
<P></P>
If you successfully hit, the victim can't use his pinned weapon until the pin
is broken, and you can't use your pinning weapon or shield until the pin is
broken.
<P></P>
When the pin is first performed, the victim gets one chance to struggle, using
a Strength roll exactly as described for the Grab maneuver, above. If he
succeeds, he yanks the weapon free; if he has attacks left this round, he can use
all of them. If he fails, the weapon remains pinned for the rest of the round;
the victim loses one of his attacks for the round (if he only had one, he's out
of luck until next round); but next round and in succeeding rounds, his first
struggle attempt each round does not count against his available attacks.
(Subsequent ones in the same round do count as attacks.)
<P></P>
It is possible to Pin someone with the missile weapon you are carrying (except
for the ordinary Sling). While it's being used to Pin, it may not be used as a
missile weapon. If it was armed (an arrow was nocked, a quarrel was in place,
or a stone was in the staff-sling's pouch), it loses that missile in the
struggle; the character must reload it later.
