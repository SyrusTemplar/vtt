<P></P>
<I>Description:</I> Travel is rarely a safe affair in the medieval fantasy setting, whether one
traverses the forbidding wilderness or the pastoral countryside. Beside the
dangers of nature and fantastic menaces, such as dragons and giants, there are
humans who prey on their journeying kin. Almost every stretch of road near
civilization is claimed by one or more bands of highwaymen, and even the far wilderness
may hide the strongholds of robbers.
<P></P>
Bandits must be strong and hardy to withstand the harsh forces of nature, the
people who seek their destruction, and even each other. Thieves must have
minimum scores of 10, then, in both Strength and Constitution to be eligible for the
Bandit kit.
<P></P>
<I>Role:</I> Bandits are often vicious characters, desperate, cunning, and cruel. They are
prone to fight or even betray each other, but two things keep them bound in
groups: the utter necessity of cooperation in order to survive the perils of the
wilderness (let alone to be successful robbers), and the strength of whoever
has established himself as leader among them by force and cunning.
<P></P>
Some leaders manage to weld together very large groups of Bandits. In some
AD&amp;D® worlds, such as the WORLD OF GREYHAWK® Fantasy Setting, there are even
kingdoms of Bandits. Such things are rare, however, since few leaders have the
Strength or Charisma to bind many of these thieves; or even if they do, the mob will
rarely stay together beyond the leader's demise.
<P></P>
Bandits do not belong to guilds, as such. A large group of them, or a network
of cooperating groups, may be considered analogous to a guild,
however—providing some training, intimidating nonmembers who operate in their &quot;territory&quot;
(including humanoids and the like), and so forth. A few Bandit groups may actually
have connections to a big city guild, though such ties would probably be very
loose (perhaps occasional cooperation, rather than subservience).
<P></P>
Bandits rarely have pleasant reasons for pursuing their lifestyles. Most have
a history better left behind, and many have a price (or three) on their heads
in some place or another. The average Bandit would be better off outside the
wilderness, but with enemies and authorities elsewhere, it is the closest
available thing to a sanctuary.
<P></P>
Bandits can expect less than mercy at the hands of the law. As if Banditry
itself wasn't punishable, most of these thieves already have a few major crimes
under their belt. But, like a city guild, Bandits can work out arrangements with
local military and civilian authorities. In exchange for bribes and a cut of
the take, Bandits may garner information on rich targets and how best to avoid
the punitive expeditions that may periodically be sent against them.
<P></P>
<I>Secondary Skills:</I> Bowyer/Fletcher, Farmer, Fisher, Forester, Gambler, Groom, Hunter, Leather
worker, Tailor/Weaver, Teamster/Freighter, Trader/Barterer, Trapper/Furrier,
Weaponsmith, Woodworker/Carpenter.
<P></P>
<I>Skill Progression:</I> The skills favored by Bandits are those useful for scouting and preparing
ambushes—specifically, climb walls (for tree-climbing), move silently, and hide in
shadows. Find/remove traps also tends to develop with a Bandit's knowledge of
snares, pits and so forth, which may be employed on occasion to waylay
travelers.
<P></P>
<I>Weapon Proficiencies</I>: Bandits are particularly partial to heavy, brutal, bludgeoning weapons. For
this reason they may use the following cudgel-like weapons in addition to those
normally permitted to thieves: flail, mace, morning star and warhammer. At
least one of the Bandit's initial weapon proficiency slots must be filled by a
bludgeoning weapon. Bandits must also take proficiency in the knife. They not only
use this for fighting (some among them regard knife-fighting as a spectator
sport), but as practical equipment for wilderness survival. Since this fills the
two weapon proficiencies open to a thief, the Bandit is granted a third initial
weapon proficiency slot, to fill with the weapon of his choice (from among
those permitted to thieves).
<P></P>
<I>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</I> Required: Survival (choose appropriate terrain). Recommended: Alertness,
Animal Handling/Training, Animal Noise, Fire-building, Intimidation, Looting,
Riding, Rope Use, Set Snares, Swimming.
<P></P>
<I>Equipment:</I> A Bandit should be well-equipped for wilderness survival. Vital items include
provisions, backpack and pouches, flint and steel (which are more reliable
than a magnifying glass for starting fires—especially at night!), tinder, a
blanket, and a knife.
<P></P>
Less vital, but often of use, are climbing equipment (crampons, pitons, etc.),
fishing gear (hooks, line, net), light sources (candle, lantern, torch), rope,
sewing needle and thread, sacks for loot, a signal whistle, spyglass, small
tent, thieves' picks, and a whetstone (so you can sharpen your knife when there's
nothing else to do).
<P></P>
Some Bandits, finally, like to have trained animals (dogs, falcons, pigeons)
for hunting or message-carrying. To make effective use of such an animal, animal
handling proficiency is needed.
<P></P>
<I>Special Benefits</I>: Because of their adeptness at ambushing, Bandits gain +1 on their attempt to
surprise in a wilderness setting.
<P></P>
<I>Special Hindrances</I>: Bandits are generally despised by other characters: Normal people hate and
fear highwaymen, and other types of thieves tend to look at them with scorn, as
outcasts and crude robbers. For this reason, any Bandit who is recognized as
such suffers a -2 reaction penalty among non-Bandit NPCs.
<P></P>
<I>Races:</I> Bandits are a motley group, and any race may be found among them—even races
with a tradition of antipathy, although such characters are likely to fight each
other as much as the band's targets. Humanoid and part-humanoid characters in
particular favor the Bandit kit. Demihuman characters who join Bandit groups
with other races are probably outcasts from among their own people.
