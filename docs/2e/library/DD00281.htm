Deliberate change is engineered by the player. He decides he doesn't want to
play the alignment he originally chose. Perhaps he doesn't understand it, or
it's not as much fun as he imagined, or it's clear that the player character will
have a more interesting personality with a different alignment.
<P></P>
All the player has to do is have his character start acting according to the
new alignment. Depending on the severity of the actions and the determination of
the player, the change can be quick or slow.
