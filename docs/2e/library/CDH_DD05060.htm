A character who started with a druid kit later may desire to abandon it. There
should be a good campaign reason for this decision. For example, an Adviser
whose lord has died or whose schemes have been thwarted repeatedly might decide
to give up politics in favor of more personal involvement with Nature. Or, an
Outlaw who has won a pardon has no reason to remain an Outlaw.
<P></P>
Discuss the question of abandoning the current kit with your DM. If this
decision hinges on a specific event that happened to the <I>character</I>, change the druid's kit as soon as it's convenient. If, on the other hand,
you have simply grown tired of <I>playing</I> a certain kit, the DM should come up with a scenario whose story line
presents the character with a good reason for abandoning the kit.
<P></P>
Suppose, for instance, that you have been role-playing an Avenger--a druid who
became an Avenger because orcs destroyed his forest. It can become boring to
play a character whose sole goal is vengeance. Here are some possibilities for
retiring the kit:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The DM arranges a scenario in which the Avenger destroys the orc leader, then
realizes he has sated his thirst for revenge.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The DM sets up an adventure in which the Avenger chances upon a village
threatened by marauding monsters. After saving the villagers, he decides to devote
his time to continuing to protect them, rather than hunting down his one-time
foes.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The DM designs a story in which the Avenger, in his obsessive thirst for
vengeance, comes close to harming innocent people or wildlife. As a result, the
Avenger decides to alter his approach to life.
<P></P>
The player whose druid character abandons a kit must role-play the decision
and any consequences that arise from it. The druid gives up all the kit's
benefits and hindrances. The PC does not lose any bonus proficiencies (marked with
asterisks), but they are no longer bonuses. The former Avenger in the above
example must pay for them as soon as possible by spending the next proficiency slots
he gains on them.
