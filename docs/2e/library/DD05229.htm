If you're Grabbing someone to hold him against his will, you need to consult
the Wrestling rules from the Player-s Handbook, <A HREF="PHB_DD01704.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01704.htm">pages 97-98</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. Also, see below under ``Punching, Wrestling, and Martial Arts.''
<P></P>
If you're Grabbing someone and you use only one hand, you have two strikes
against you. First, the attack is treated as a Called Shot, with the usual
penalties; second, you're treated as if your Strength ability score were 3 less. If
you have a Strength of 15 and grab someone one-handed, you make your Strength
roll as if you had a Strength of 12.
<P></P>
(Strengths of 18 aren't automatically dropped to a 15; it depends on the 18
Strength's percentile bonus. An 18/00 drops to an 18/51. An 18/91?18/99 drops to
an 18/01. An 18/76?18/90 drops to a plain 18. An 18/51?18/75 drops to a 17. An
18/01 drops to a 16. And the plain 18 drops to a 15.)
<P></P>
If you use both hands, you don't have to use the Called Shot rules; you can
make a Wrestling attack without announcing it far in advance, and don't suffer
the +1 initiative or ?4 to attack penalty. Also, you get to use your full
Strength score. Determine the results of your attack as a Wrestling attack.
<P></P>
If your opponent has any attacks left this combat round, he can respond with a
Wrestling, Punching, or other attack (such as stabbing you with a short
weapon, for instance). If your Wrestling attack roll resulted in a hold of some sort
(any result on the ``Punching and Wrestling Results'' chart with a &quot;*&quot; beside
it), he has a ?4 penalty to attack rolls with any attack but another Wrestling
attack. However, he can use his attack to try to break your hold (using the
Strength roll tactic described above, under the description for Grab).
