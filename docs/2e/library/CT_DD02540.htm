<FONT SIZE="3">Forest, Light
<P></P>
The principal difference between heavy forest and light forest is the amount
of underbrush. Light forests have much less brush to obstruct movement on the
ground, and tend to be much airier and brighter. Small stands of trees, copses,
or orchards can all be considered light forest.
<P></P>
The ground level of a true rain forest can also be considered light forest,
since there is little underbrush and the trees are spaced a fair distance apart.
The canopy levels might be considered thickets or dense forest.
