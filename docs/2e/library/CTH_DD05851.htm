This is a catchall term for a fairly wide range of dubious behavior. Some
examples of systematic operations which a thieves' guild might run are listed below.
<P></P>
<I>Gambling:</I> Thieves might well run casinos and similar establishments. These provide a
source of income, a good meeting-place for underworld people, and the opportunity
to rip off large sums of money from patrons who are rich, drunk, stupid or
usually all three. Organized crime will be strongly involved in these operations.
<P></P>
<I>Good Time Girls:</I> Nothing much needs to be said about this, save that thieves often act as the
&quot;gentleman companions&quot; of these girls. There is a much shorter word to describe
this, of course.
<P></P>
<I>Bawds:</I> A bawd is a character who knows the seamier side of life, and makes an
in-demand &quot;tourist guide&quot; for the rich and bored (or the foreigner) who seek to
stimulate their jaded appetites in the seedy parts of town. Bawds will often be
freelancers, but they may hand over a certain percentage of their clients to
muggers and other thieves. This type of activity might well involve the thieves'
guild, even though the bawds themselves do their own work independently, and will
frequently be Chaotic Evil in alignment.
