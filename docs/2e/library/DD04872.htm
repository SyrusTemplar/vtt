Whether in woodland meadow or dungeon pit, the Stalker is a specialist in
quiet movement and stealthy pursuit followed by sharp and deadly combat--on
whatever terms the foe demands.
<P></P>
The Stalker must have Strength and Dexterity scores of at least 13.
<P></P>
Role: The Stalker is adept at hunting and tracking, both above and below
ground. He or she is a skilled fighter but prefers to reach his or her objectives by
quickness and stealth wherever possible. Stalkers wear light, quiet armor and
have a keen eye with a missile weapon but don't shirk from a toe-to-toe sword
fight when circumstances require.
<P></P>
Secondary Skills: Any.
<P></P>
Weapon Proficiencies: The Stalker must be proficient in both a missile and a
melee weapon.
<P></P>
Bonus Nonweapon Proficiencies: Because of a lifelong interest in wild places,
the Stalker gains a bonus proficiency in either Tracking or Set Snares (not
both).
<P></P>
Recommended Nonweapon Proficiencies: Useful proficiencies for this character
include Fire Building, Fishing, Hunting, Survival, and Disguise.
<P></P>
Thief Skill Emphasis: Move Silently and Detect Noise are the two skills which
receive most of the Stalker's emphasis; at first level he or she must divide
his or her discretionary points between these two.
<P></P>
Equipment: In addition to his or her weapons, the Stalker prefers leather
armor and disdains the use of a shield. Most Stalkers possess a climbing rope; some
carry a set of thief's lockpicks.
<P></P>
Special Benefits: When using a missile weapon, the Stalker gains a +1 on all
attack and damage rolls.
<P></P>
In addition, the Stalker can blend into underbrush, disappearing as
effectively as a halfling when out of doors. In an underground setting, nonSvirfneblin
Stalkers can <I>freeze in place</I> exactly like Svirfneblin (see page 25); a Deep Gnome stalker's chance of
success with this tactic is 80% (not 60%).
<P></P>
Special Hindrances: The Stalker cannot use a shield or wear any type of metal
armor (not even elven chain).
