Animals can be trained to retrieve specific types of items from a general area
such as a room or yard. Specific objects include coins, gems, jewelry such as
chains or bracelets, or even items of food and drink. Additional training
sessions can train the animal to perform its task with stealth.
<P></P>
The animal can be sent by gesture in a specific direction. It will seek for
some time in the area indicated, finally returning to its master. Generally, the
animal will spend 1d8 turns on the search. However, additional training
sessions can add another 1d8 turns to this duration.
<P></P>
If an animal is discovered or frightened during this task, it will attempt to
flee to its master. It can be trained to flee in a different direction, or even
to attack, if a good trainer takes the time to do so.
