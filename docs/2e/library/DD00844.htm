<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Staff of Withering:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The <I>staff of withering</I> is a +1 magical weapon. A hit from it causes 1d4+1 points of damage. If two
charges are expended when a hit is scored, the creature struck also ages 10
years, its abilities and lifespan adjusted for the resulting age increase. If three
charges are expended when a hit is made, one of the opponent creature's limbs
can be made to shrivel and become useless unless it successfully saves vs.
spell (check by random number generation for which limb is struck).
<P></P>
Ageless creatures (undead, demons, devils, etc) cannot be aged or withered.
Each effect of the staff is cumulative, so that three charges will score damage,
age, and wither. Aging a dwarf is of little effect, while aging a dragon could
actually aid the creature.
