Thorough preparations are a must for successful adventures at any level of
play. High-level characters, however, usually have the resources to set their own
agendas, and you should avoid spending too much time and effort on adventures
and encounters the players might choose to ignore.
<P></P>
Effective preparations start with an adventure plot (see the <B>Plots</B> section on <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01200.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01200.htm.php.html">page 35</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">). Once you have decided on a plot, gather up all statistics, maps, and other
materials needed for your encounters. Make some notes about what each encounter
area in the adventure is like. Stick to the basics for now; note what the
areas look, smell, feel, and sound like, and who or what is in them. Design any
random events or rumors the player characters might encounter. If you’re
generating events or rumors from a table, roll the dice ahead of time and record the
results.
<P></P>
Your preparations should be aimed at making sure you have what you need in
terms of hard data—monster statistics, NPC personalities, treasure lists, and so
on—in a form that you can locate and use quickly. You should not be trying to
choreograph every moment in the game; instead, you should be trying to have
everything you need readily at hand so that the action doesn’t stall while you
decide what happens next.
