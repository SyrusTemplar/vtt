<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Anticipating where your opponent will go is an important part of the duel. If
you apply your attack to the exact point that your opponent is moving
defensively, your duelist gains a +2 bonus to the attack roll. For every direction
(stationary, forward or backward, left or right) and every level (low, middle, high)
that you are off, a 2-point penalty is applied.

<I> For example, Eusebio is involved in a duel with his archnemesis, Darius the
Dastardly. Eusebio’s player secretly chooses to step to the left and perform a
defensive block maneuver. At the same time, Eusebio will perform a normal attack,
anticipating that Darius will leap back.
<P></P>
Darius, however, decides to tumble forward, making a normal defense and a
normal attack. Since Eusebio guessed incorrectly two direction places (from back to
stationary, stationary to forward) and two levels (high to medium, medium to
low), he will suffer a –6 penalty to his attack roll (he starts with a +2 bonus,
but loses four 2-point penalties for the four displacements).
