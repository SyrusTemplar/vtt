With this spell, the caster creates an invisible force field that repels
nonmagical insects, rodents, spiders, snakes, worms, and similar vermin of less than
1 Hit Die. The spell has no effect on giant-sized versions of these creatures
unless they are less than 1 Hit Die. The barrier affects summoned creatures,
such as those called by a summon insects spell.
<P></P>
Any vermin within the area of effect when the spell is cast are not affected;
however, when these creatures exit the area, they cannot return.
<P></P>
The spell affects a cubic area whose sides are 10 feet times the caster's
level (for instance, a 2nd-level priest could affect a 20'x 20'x 20' cube.
<P></P>
The material components are the caster's holy symbol and a rodent's whisker.
