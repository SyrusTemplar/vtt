One of the great strengths of the AD&amp;D® game and its attendant campaign worlds
is the diversity of character types that will be present, both as NPCs and
generally as PCs. The mixture of combat, stealth, sorcery, and spiritual abilities
all add to the whole in ways that can help keep the game fresh and imaginative
even after many years of play.
<P></P>
However, this should in no way inhibit players with similar interests from
creating PCs of the same class. Indeed, there are many situations where such
groups make ideal adventuring parties—a small group of captains commanding several
companies of soldiers upon a mission of conquest, for example, might all be
fighters.
<P></P>
Nowhere does this specialization lend itself so well to a campaign setting as
when a band of thieves gather to embark upon missions of stealth. The presence
of a fighter, with his heavy boots and clanking armor, can be a serious
hindrance to such a group. Characters of all other classes will find sheer surfaces to
be serious obstacles, even as the thieves are already scrambling down the far
side. And indeed, no character can move so quietly, or remain hidden so
effectively, as can a thief.
<P></P>
The tactics discussed in this section do not imply that a campaign must be
populated exclusively with player character thieves. Players who wish to run
characters of other classes should be able to do so, and the DM should be sure to
provide appropriate challenges to all characters. However, if most PCs choose to
play thief characters, a variety of adventure opportunities beckon.
Additionally, interesting roles and activities for other character classes are easy to
generate.
