</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Acid attacks</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">(Acid) assume there is either a sizeable quantity of acid or that contact with
the acid is prolonged.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Crushing Blows</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">(Cr. Blow) include strikes by the clubs of creatures of giant size or greater.
Blows by normal people on small, fragile objects also fall into this category.
A normal human could not do a crushing blow on a rope, which isn't very
fragile, but could certainly do so on a potion flask. Breakable items hurled against
hard surfaces--bottles thrown against walls, for example--also use the crushing
blow column.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Disintegration</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> (Dis.) applies only to the magical effects of the spell or spell-like ability.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Falls</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B> </B>(Fall) must be greater than five feet. If the surface is hard, the listed
saving throw is used. If the surface is soft, give a +5 bonus to the saving throw.
For every five feet fallen beyond the first, apply a -1 penalty to the saving
throw.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Magical fires</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">(Mag. Fire) include fireballs, dragon-breath, and any sizeable body of flame
created by a spell or spell-like effect. Extraordinarily hot normal fires, such
as the lava from a volcano, should also use this saving throw.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Normal fires</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">(Nor. Fire) include campfires, candle flames, and bonfires. Obviously, the
item must be in the flame for a sufficient time to be affected.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cold</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> (Cold) covers any intense, abnormal, or magical cold. If the temperature
change is gradual, a +2 bonus is applied to the saving throw.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Lightning bolt</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">(Light.) applies to attacks by the spell or spell-like power of the same name.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Electrical</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> (Elec.) is for those electrical attacks that do not carry the wallop of the
lightning bolt. Electric eels and magical traps fall into this category.
