When this spell is cast, the wizard can whisper messages and receive replies
with little chance of being overheard. When the spell is cast, the wizard
secretly or openly points his finger at each creature to be included in the spell
effect. Up to one creature per level can be included. When the wizard whispers,
the whispered message travels in a straight line and is audible to all of the
involved creatures within 30 feet, plus 10 feet per level of the caster. The
creatures who receive the message can whisper a reply that is heard by the
spellcaster. Note that there must be an unobstructed path between the spellcaster and
the recipients of the spell. The message must be in a language the caster speaks;
this spell does not by itself confer understanding upon the recipients. This
spell is most often used to conduct quick and private conferences when the
caster does not wish to be overheard.

The material component of the spell is a short piece of copper wire.
