The misanthrope doesn't like the company of people. Usually she considers
mankind bad for Nature. A misanthrope may have had a particularly bad experience
that soured her on mankind. Depending on her kit, she may prefer the company of
animals or the solitude of the wilds.
<P></P>
In role-playing, the misanthrope generally assumes the worst of people. She
may not act hostile, but it takes a lot of effort from the party to encourage
friendliness. By her very nature, she tends toward dour, pessimistic behavior. She
trusts no humans, and few demihumans or humanoids.
<P></P>
The misanthrope's unselfish love of Nature partially redeems her hostility;
characters who display a similar affection for animals or the wild find her a
true friend. Even so, deeds, not words, are the only things that can win her
friendship.
<P></P>
The misanthrope has trouble verbalizing feelings--even if she likes or
approves of someone, she won't say so. She'll simply offer her assistance. If she
dislikes someone, or if something makes her angry, she's likely to turn her back
and leave without a word.
<P></P>
In combat, she doesn't bluff and rarely utters a threat more than once. If she
must use violence to protect herself or something she cares for, she'll strike
without warning.
<P></P>
A misanthrope doesn't fit in with a party of human adventurers, but she makes
a good NPC, especially if the party has a particular reason to seek her
friendship.
<P></P>
This personality type works well with Beastfriends, Guardians, Shapeshifters,
and Totemic Druids. It can fit Avengers, Natural Philosophers, and Wanderers,
but does not suit Advisers, Savages, or Village Druids.
