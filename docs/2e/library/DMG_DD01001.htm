<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Medallion of Thought Projection:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This device is like an <I>ESP Medallion</I> in every respect, even as to the range at which it functions. However, in
addition to picking up the thoughts of creatures, it will broadcast the thoughts
of the user to the creatures in the path of the beam, thus alerting them. To
prevent projecting thoughts, the user rolls 1d6. On a roll of 6, the thoughts
remain a secret.
