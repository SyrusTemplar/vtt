</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Some scrolls bear powerful <I>curses,</I> placed intentionally or as a result of flawed scroll-making. <I>Cursed</I> scrolls take effect the instant they are first read. A <I>cursed</I> scroll can have any effect the DM desires, although a few should be outright
deadly. Suggested <I>curses</I> include the following:
<P></P>
<B>? </B>Bad luck (-1 on attacks and saving throws).
<P></P>
<B>? </B>The character's beard grows 1 inch per minute.
<P></P>
<B>? </B>The character is teleported away from the rest of the party.
<P></P>
<B>? </B>Random monster appears and attacks.
<P></P>
<B>? </B>The character is polymorphed into a mouse.
<P></P>
<B>? </B>The character shrinks to half his normal size.
<P></P>
<B>? </B>The character is stricken with weakness, halving his Strength score.
<P></P>
<B>? </B>The character falls into a deep sleep from which he can't be roused.
<P></P>
<B>? </B>The character develops an uncontrollable appetite.
<P></P>
<B>? </B>The character must always talk in rhyme (preventing spellcasting).
<P></P>
<B>? </B>The character is stricken with cowardice and must make a morale check every
time
<P></P>
a monster is encountered.
<P></P>

<B>? </B>The character feels compelled to give away all his belongings.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
In general, the effects of a curse can be negated or reversed by a <I>remove curse.</I> Some cases (such as <I>petrification</I>) may require the use of other spells. Overcoming a curse should be difficult
for the player characters, but not impossible.
