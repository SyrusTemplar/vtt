This spell allows a priest to sense how far a character, creature, object, or
area is from a condition of balance -- in other words, the degree to which its
alignment is removed from true Neutral. The spell gives no indication of the
&quot;direction&quot; in which the alignment is removed from true Neutral except under
certain conditions which follow. The spell does, however, indicate along which axis
or axes of alignment the variation lies.
<P></P>
For example, a priest uses this spell to analyze the balance of a Chaotic
Neutral creature. The spell indicates that the creature is removed from Neutral by
one grade, and the variation is along the Law/Chaos axis; thus, the creature
must be either Chaotic Neutral or Lawful Neutral. If the creature were Chaotic
Evil, the spell would indicate that it is removed from balance by two grades, one
along each axis; thus, the creature must be Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Good, Lawful
Evil, or Lawful Good.
<P></P>
A priest has a 5% chance per level of correctly determining the direction of
variation along one randomly chosen axis. This means that a 10th-level priest
evaluating the balance of a Chaotic Neutral creature would have a 50% chance of
learning that the creature is Chaotic (and hence Chaotic Neutral, since it is
only one step away from balance).
<P></P>
Similar to spells such as <I>detect evil</I>, this spell will not yield a result on a hidden trap. If cast on a creature
with an intelligence level of &quot;animal&quot; or &quot;non-,&quot; it will always read true
Neutral (i.e., zero steps removed from balance).
<P></P>
The material components are four iron coins which the priest tosses in his
hand while concentrating on the spell. The coins are not consumed in the casting.
