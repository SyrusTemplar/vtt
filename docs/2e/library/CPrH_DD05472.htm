The DM may wish to limit certain priesthoods to certain races.
<P></P>
This is almost always a choice based on the history of his own campaign world.
There is no game-related reason why most races can't have priests for any god,
force or philosophy; but there are often campaign-related reasons why a
certain race can't belong to a certain priesthood.
<P></P>
For example, if the halflings of a specific campaign world are pacifists,
they'll be excluded from priesthood in the faith of the war-god. If dwarves are
pragmatic, unromantic sorts who arrange all their marriages and don't conduct
affairs of the heart, they'll be excluded from priesthood in the faith of the
love-god.
<P></P>
In the next chapter, we provide numerous examples of priesthoods of specific
mythoi. With each, there's a recommendation for allowed races. These
recommendations are based on the most common and popular conceptions of these races, and
the DM is free to change them for his specific campaign.
<P></P>
Players beware: When the <I>Complete Priest's Handbook</I> says one thing about allowed races, and the DM says another, the DM is always
right.
