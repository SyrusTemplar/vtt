<P></P>
<B>Case of Compression:</B> When empty, this musical instrument case appears as any other such case.
However, when touched to any instrument normally carried in a case, it transforms
so that it perfectly fits the instrument. When the case is closed with the
instrument inside, it shrinks until it easily fits in the palm of the hand. The
reduced case weighs only a pound. When the case is opened, it returns itself and
its instrument to full size.
<P></P>
About 10% of these cases are cursed; such cases devour the instrument 25% of
the time.
<P></P>
<B>Gourd of Travel:</B> By shaking this gourd and saying the command word, the bard is able to
teleport himself and one other to any known place. A<I> gourd of travel</I> does not allow for travel between planes.
<P></P>
A <I>gourd of travel</I> has 1d10 seeds within it, which produce the rattling sound that causes the
gourd to function. Every time the gourd is used, one of these seeds vanishes.
When the last seed vanishes, the gourd becomes a nonmagical item.
<P></P>
<B>Harp of Healing:</B> When this magical harp is played within 10 feet of wounded creatures, it
heals each creature by one point per hour of playing. However, once the music stops
or a new player takes over, further playing is useless unless new wounds are
received.
<P></P>
After eight hours of continuous playing, a bard must begin to make successful
Constitution rolls once an hour or he misplays the harp and healing ends.
<P></P>
<B>Horn of Amplification:</B> This horn is not hollow as one would expect. Rather, it is solid and
resembles the horn of a rhinoceros. It is used by touching its base to the forehead. It
magically attaches and conveys its special power. At this time, the one
wearing the horn has his voice amplified from two to ten times in volume. The exact
increase is up to the character using the horn. The horn has no other function.
It can be removed by anyone who lightly pulls on it.
<P></P>
This horn increases the range of all songs, jokes, rhymes, and other forms of
verbal communication proportionately (<I>e.g.,</I> an amplification of five increases the range by five times the normal
distance).
<P></P>
The character can also yell. A yell causes 2d10 points of damage to everyone
except the user within a range of 5 feet times the amplification (<I>e.g.,</I> setting 2 has a 10-foot range, setting 5 has a 25-foot range, etc.). A
successful saving throw vs. petrification reduces damage by half. Only one yell per
encounter can be attempted.
<P></P>
Each time the horn is used, there is a 1% chance that it permanently affixes
to the user's forehead and loses all magical ability. It can then be used as a
weapon for head butts, causing 1d3 points of damage. However, the oddity of
having a horn growing from the character's head results in a -2 Charisma penalty. A
wish must be used to remove the horn.
<P></P>
<B>Horn of Baubles:</B> When this instrument is blown, one 5'x5'x5' cube of useless baubles spews out
of it per level of the blower. Although this is usually rather comical, it can
be dangerous in a limited space.
<P></P>
The instrument can be safely blown once every hour. If blown more frequently,
there is a 10% cumulative chance that the horn backfires, sucking the blower
into it and spewing him out as a collection of useless baubles. It is impossible
to resurrect or reincarnate a creature in this state, although a <I>wish</I> can be used to recover the victim.
<P></P>
<B>Lyre of Wounding:</B> This cursed item appears normal in every way until it is first played. When
the musician's fingers strike its strings, they sever the tips of his fingers.
Roll 1d6 for the number of fingers that the musician loses: 1-4 the number of
lost fingers, 5 all fingers and the thumb, and 6 escaped unscathed. Each finger
lost causes 1d2 points of damage, but the musician should not be lowered below 1
hit point due to lost fingers.
<P></P>
Each lost finger causes the musician's proficiency at playing musical
instruments to suffer a penalty of -2. Other proficiencies and activities requiring
manual dexterity are likewise reduced, at the DM's discretion. Lost digits can be
regenerated magically.
<P></P>
As with cursed swords, whenever the musician decides to play, the lyre leaps
into his hands; magically altering the form of the instrument does not abate its
curse.
<P></P>
<B>Periapt of Proof Against Sound:</B> This small periapt is indistinguishable from other gems. The character who
has this periapt gains extra resistance to any sound-based attack or influence.
If a saving throw is normally allowed, the periapt provides an extra bonus to
the saving throw. The level of the bonus depends upon the quality of the periapt,
as follows:

If no saving throw is usually allowed, the periapt provides a normal saving
throw vs. spell against the sound. A<I> periapt of proof against sound</I> affects all hostile sounds, including harpy singing, sirens, screams or
shrieks that cause damage or fear, all musical influences (including bard
abilities), spells that rely upon verbal communication to affect their victims (<I>e.g., command, suggestion, etc.</I>), and so on. However, the periapt has no effect upon communication, such as,
&quot;Kill that stupid bard!,&quot; verbal components for spells, magical item command
words, or any other sound that does not directly affect the individual who has
the periapt.
<P></P>
<B>Pick of Strumming:</B> This magical pick enables the user to play any stringed instrument that is
normally plucked with fingers or a pick. This includes harps, lutes, mandolins,
etc. The person grasping the pick can play any song he has ever heard. The
pick's magic is so great that all functions of the instrument are instantly
mastered. Thus, the bard automatically knows the proper grips to use on the lute, how
to hold the harp, how to adjust the strings of the mandolin, <I>etc.</I> His skill level rivals that of a master musician proficient in the
instrument's use.
<P></P>
Also, a bard who uses this pick to play the lyre of wounding does not suffer
any severed fingers.
<P></P>
<B>Recorder of Recording:</B> This recorder has two magical functions. If, after a song is played on it,
the bard says, &quot;Play it again when X happens,&quot; the recorder will magically play
the entire song over again any time condition X occurs (<I>e.g.,</I> &quot;When Tarnak comes within 20 feet.&quot;).
<P></P>
The other magical function is activated by speaking the word, &quot;record,&quot; before
playing a song. At any later time, the bard can say, &quot;play back,&quot; and the
recorder produces all sounds that it recorded within 30 feet during the song.
Furthermore, these sounds are played back as if the recorder hadn't been making any
noise at the time.
<P></P>
The recorder does not reproduce special sound-based attacks of any sort.
<P></P>
<B>Zither of Speed:</B> This zither appears to be a normal musical instrument. However, if it is
played in a rapid tempo and the musician says, &quot;Adagietto,&quot; all allies within 30
feet are affected as if under the influence of a <I>haste</I> spell.
<P></P>
If the zither is played slowly and &quot;Adagissimo&quot; is spoken, all foes within 30
feet are affected as if under a <I>slow</I> spell (no saving throw). The effects last as long as the bard concentrates
upon the music or until he plays the zither at a moderate tempo and says,
&quot;Andante.&quot; If he moves, defends himself, suffers damage, rolls for a saving throw, or
performs any other action, his concentration is broken.
<P></P>
A <I>zither of speed</I> functions only once per day. Furthermore, for every successive day in a row
that its magic is used, there is a 10% cumulative chance that one of its strings
breaks, rendering the item useless unless it can be repaired.
