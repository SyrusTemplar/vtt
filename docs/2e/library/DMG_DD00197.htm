<P></P>
This method gives the players more choice when creating their characters yet
still ensures that, overall, ability scores are not excessive. Bad characters
are still possible, especially if a player has several poor rolls. The majority
of characters have average abilities.
<P></P>
Since players can arrange their scores however they want, it is easier to meet
the requirements for an unusual class. Classes with exceptionally strict
standards (the paladin in particular) are still uncommon.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Method III Disadvantages:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This method is more time-consuming than I or II, especially if players try to
&quot;minimize/maximize&quot; their choice of race and class. (To minimize/maximize, or
min/max, is to examine every possibility for the greatest advantage.) Players
may need to be encouraged to create the character they see in their imaginations,
not the one that gains the most pluses on dice rolls. The example below shows
fighters created using this method.
