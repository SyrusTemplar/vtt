</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Several of the monsters in this book have been imported from specialized game
worlds, such as the SPELLJAMMER? campaign setting, the FORGOTTEN REALMS?
setting, or the DARK SUN? world. The monsters in this book may be used in any
setting; if a campaign setting is noted, it simply describes where the monster was
first encountered, or where it is the most common. A particular monster still may
not be encountered in a specific campaign world; this is up to the DM. For
monsters from one of the specific worlds, the DM should consult the appropriate
MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM appendices.
