This spell creates an exact copy of any single item the caster touches. The
item to be copied must fit inside a 20-foot cube. The spell has no effect on
living creatures, including undead, nor will it copy magical items. The <I>duplicated</I> item is identical to the original in every way--for instance, a duplicated
sword can be wielded to inflict damage as a normal sword--but detect magic can
reveal its true nature and <I>dispel magic</I> can cause it to disappear. The <I>duplicated </I>object exists for 1 hour/level of the caster, at which time it vanishes; <I>permanency</I> does not affect duplicated items.
<P></P>
The material component for this spell is a pinch of coal dust.

By means of this spell, the caster surrounds his body with an aura of magical
green fire. The <I>fire aura</I> extends 1 foot from the caster's body and provides illumination in a 10-foot
radius. The <I>fire aura</I> provides complete immunity to all forms of fire, both natural and magical;
the flames can be extinguished only by <I>dispel magic</I> or a similar spell. Those touching the <I>fire aura</I> suffer 2-8 (2d4) hit points of damage; additionally, if the touched victim
fails to make his saving throw, his body is set afire with green flames.
<P></P>
The flames persist for 2-8 (2d4) rounds and can be extinguished only by <I>dispel magic</I> or a similar spell. Each round the victim is engulfed in these flames, he
suffers an additional 1-6 hit points of damage; the victim's attack rolls are made
with a -2 penalty during this time.

<I>Halo of eyes</I> creates a halo of functional eyeballs that sits atop the caster's head,
enabling the caster to see in all directions at the same time. Additionally, these
magical eyes all have infravison to a distance of 60 yards. The caster can see
opponents on all sides of him, providing they are not <I>invisible</I>, and therefore can never by struck from behind or suffer a penalty for a back
attack. Under normal conditions, the caster cannot be surprised. Attacks
cannot be directed against the magical eyeballs, but their vision is obscured by <I>blindness</I> and other magical and natural effects that would hinder the wizard's normal
sight.

The material components for this spell are the feather of an eagle and an
eyelash from the corpse of any creature.

A variation of <I>gust of wind</I>, this spell allows the caster to fill his lungs with air and expel a powerful
wind. The strength of this wind is about 5 miles per hour for every level of
the caster. Those outside the area of effect do not notice the tremendous winds,
though objects may be blown out of the spell's area into their path. The DM
should determine the precise effects of the <I>wind breath</I> using the following parameters as guidelines.
<P></P>
If the <I>wind breath</I> is 30-50 miles per hour, there is a 10 percent chance that small boats
capsize, a 1 percent chance that ships capsize, and a 10 percent chance that a man is
knocked down. There is a 20 percent chance that branches snap, light articles
are blown away, and tents and sails tear. Creatures caught in the cone of the
wind breath suffer 1 hit points of damage from blown sand and grit.
<P></P>
If the <I>wind breath</I> is 50-70 miles per hour, there is a 70 percent chance that small boats
capsize, a 20 percent chance that ships capsize, and a 50 percent chance that a man
is knocked down. Trees bend and there is a 70 percent chance that branches snap,
and a 20 percent chance that a trunk snaps. Medium-sized articles are blown
away, and there is a 50 percent chance that tents and sails are torn, and a 40
percent chance that shacks are blown down. Creatures caught in the cone of the <I>wind breath</I> suffer 1-4 hit points of damage from sand and grit. Flying creatures are
blown back 10-40 (10d4) feet.)
<P></P>
If the<I> wind breath</I> is 70 miles per hour or more, there is a 100 percent chance that small boats
capsize, a 70 percent chance that ships capsize, and a 70 percent chance that a
man is knocked down and blown 10-40 (10d4) feet to suffer 1-6 hit points of
damage per 10 feet blown. There is a 70 percent chance that tree trunks snap, and
a 100 percent chance that branches are ripped from trees. Heavy articles are
blown away, medium articles are ripped from fastenings, and tents and sails have
a 70 percent chance of being destroyed. There is a 20 percent chance that
common buildings are blown down and a 60 percent chance that shacks are flattened.
Creatures caught in the cone of the <I>wind breath</I> suffer 1-8 hit points of damage from blown objects. Flying creatures are
blown back 50-100 (40+10d6) feet.
