A foxwoman is an elven-appearing woman who is able to transform herself into a
silver fox form or a silver-furred humanoid (vixen) form with a fox's head.
They are extremely self-centered.
<P></P>
The female elven form of the foxwoman is extremely beautiful. She has silver
or silver-streaked hair, including a widow's peak. She dresses attractively in
loose garments. A pouch holds valuables and spell components.
<P></P>
The vixen form is a hybrid of elven and fox-like features. The body and limbs
are those of the elven form but covered with silvery fur. The head and tail are
fox-like. The vixen may wear elven clothing. The vixen can run very quickly
(18).
<P></P>
The silver fox form appears to be a normal, large fox. It moves extremely fast
(24), can <I>pass without trace</I>, and is 90% undetectable in undergrowth if it passes out of view for a moment.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The silver fox's bite inflicts 1-2 points of damage but is otherwise harmless.
The vixen's more savage bite causes 2d6 points of damage. Human or elven women
who are bitten by a vixen for 50% or more of their hit points become foxwomen
within three days unless both a <I>cure disease</I> and a <I>remove curse</I> spell are cast upon the victim by a priest of at least 12th level.
<P></P>
In elven form, the foxwoman relies on weapons. She gains a +1 bonus with bow
or sword. Her best weapon is her incredible beauty. Any human, humanoid, or
demihuman males whose Wisdoms are 13 or less are effectively caught by a <I>charm</I> spell. Those whose Wisdoms are 14 or greater are not charmed but still find
the foxwoman extremely attractive. In elven form, the foxwoman has magic use as
a wizard of level 1d4. She is 90% resistant to <I>sleep</I> and <I>charm</I> spells.
<P></P>
In any form, the foxwoman is able to see by infravision (60-foot range). They
can only be harmed by silver or +1 or better magical weapons. Scars from
nonfatal wounds vanish within a month.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Foxwomen dwell in lonely woodlands far from humanoid communities. Their homes
may be hidden cottages or comfortably furnished cave complexes; in either case
their homes are filled with typical human comforts. Foxwomen are solitary in
regard to their own kind. They are self-serving, vain, and hedonistic. Foxwomen
serve their vanity by enslaving humanoid males. Those males become servants and
companions.
<P></P>
Werefoxes do not keep dwarves, gnomes, or halflings; such males are slain
quietly as soon as the opportunity arises.
<P></P>
Each foxwoman is always accompanied by 1d4+1 charmed males. At least one of
the males is a fighter (70%) or ranger (30%) of level 1d4+1. There is a 50%
chance that any one of the other males is also a fighter of level 1d4. There is a
10% chance that one of the remaining males is a cleric (10%), druid (45%), mage
(10%), thief (25%), or some other class (10%) of level 1d4. Of her elven or
half-elven companions, 25% are multi-class characters. All males who do not fit
into any of the above categories are 0-level fighters and elves or half-elves of 1
Hit Die. The males may use such magical items as they possessed prior to being
charmed into the foxwoman's service.
<P></P>
Foxwomen are barren. They must kidnap or adopt their children. There is a 10%
chance that a foxwoman has a &quot;daughter.&quot; The foxwoman has stolen an elven
girl, infected her with lycanthropy, and is raising her as a foxwoman. Such a child
is be 1d8+5 years old. If she is 12-13, she is treated the same as a normal
foxwoman; otherwise she is a noncombatant.
<P></P>
Non-elven women who are afflicted with lycanthropy undergo a slow
transformation that alters their normal form. Over a period of one to two years, such women
turn into elven women; only their faces and odd marks (tattoos, birthmarks)
provide faint proof of their old identities.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Foxwomen are unique among the lycanthropes. They have no major goals or
desires aside from pampering themselves and feeding their vanity. They have little
contact with other foxwomen (whom they see as rivals), real foxes (irrelevant
beasts), or other lycanthropes (crude, unattractive, and uncharmable).
