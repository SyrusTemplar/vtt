It's possible for a barehanded fighter to disarm an armed opponent, but it's
dangerous. When so trying, the barehanded fighter's AC suffers a penalty of 2
(for example, a 5 becomes a 7; he's having to expose himself to attack briefly),
and his Disarm attempt is at an additional â€“4 to attack rolls. But if it hits,
it's just as successful as any other Disarm.
