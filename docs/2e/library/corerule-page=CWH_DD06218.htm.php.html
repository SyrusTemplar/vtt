<B>Wish</B>
<P></P>
Since it can theoretically have any effect, no spell is more difficult for the
DM to adjudicate than <I>wish.</I> The DM can save himself a lot of headaches if he decides the limits of wish
before his campaign begins. The DM is not obligated to discuss the ramifications
of wishes with his players before a campaign begins. In fairness, however, he
should be willing to give his players a general idea of his approach. While it
is impossible to anticipate every conceivable use of a <I>wish</I>, there are a few key areas the DM should consider:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> How far can a<I> wish</I> move a character from one place to another? How many characters or creatures
can be affected? Must the conjurer have first-hand knowledge of the destination?
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> What types of items can a <I>wish</I> create? How much treasure? Are such creations permanent?
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> How many creatures can a single<I> wish</I> bring back to life?
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> How many creatures can a single <I>wish</I> destroy? Could a wish automatically destroy, for instance, a 20th-level
wizard? How about a dragon? Are there alternatives to eliminating creatures other
than <I>wishing </I>them dead?
<P></P>
Following are some guidelines for what <I>wishes</I> can accomplish. As always, the DM is free to alter these suggestions in any
way he sees fit. Suggestions noted with an asterisk (*) typically require a
penalty for the caster. The nature of the penalty is up to the DM; possibilities
include 2d4 days of bed rest, a temporary loss of 1-4 Strength points, a
permanent loss of 1 Constitution point, damage of 2d10 hit points, or any combination
of these penalties.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> A <I>wish</I> can create a random amount of treasure for the caster. A good range is 1,000
- 10,000 gp (1d10 x 1,000). The treasure can include gold pieces, jewelry,
gems, items, or any combination desired by the caster within the randomly
determined monetary value. Magical items are excluded (they require a separate <I>wish</I> ).
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> A <I>wish</I> can heal damage for the caster, his companions, or any characters or
creatures of the caster's choice. A good range is 45-70 hit points (5d6 + 40) healed.
These recovered hit points can be spread among as many characters as the caster
desires; for instance, if a <I>wish</I> heals 50 hit points, the caster could heal 20 hit points of his own damage
and heal 10 hit points for three of his companions. If a <I>wish</I> is used to heal damage in this way, it cannot be used to restore life; that
is, it cannot affect any creature who has been reduced to 0 hit points.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> * A <I>wish</I> can restore life to any creature who was reduced to 0 hit points or less
within the previous 24 hours. The <I>wish</I> restores the subject to exactly 1 hit point. Success is not automatic; the
subject is required to make a resurrection survival check.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> * A <I>wish</I> can destroy any single creature of 10 HD or less, or any character of 10th
level or less within the caster's visual range. The affected creature or
character is allowed a saving throw vs. death magic; if the check is successful, the
creature is unaffected. (Be careful with this--in many cases, it is a better idea
to advance the spellcaster to a future time period in which the target
creature no longer exists, as described on page 197 of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>).
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> A <I>wish</I> can<I> teleport without error</I> the caster and up to a dozen companions to any location. The caster must have
been to the location previously. The location can be in any plane of
existence.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> * A <I>wish</I> can permanently add one point to any ability score of the caster or any
person of the caster's choice, as long as the score is not raised above 16. It takes
10 <I>wishes</I> to permanently raise any ability score each point beyond 16. (For instance,
it takes 20 <I>wishes</I> to raise a character's Strength from 16 to 18.)
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> A <I>wish</I> can temporarily raise an ability to 18 for 1-6 hours.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> A <I>wish</I> can duplicate the effects of any other spell.
<P></P>
<P></P>
What can't a <I>wish</I> do? Aside from the restrictions above, a <I>wish</I> should never grant experience points or extra levels to a character. Nor
should <I>wishes</I> be able to duplicate artifacts or create extremely potent magical items (a <I>potion of invisibility</I> might be acceptable, but a <I>sword +4</I> might not). The DM retains the right to disallow any wish he believes is too
potent. He can also bestow an interpretation of the <I>wish</I> that follows the literal instructions of the wizard, and not the wizard's
intended meaning (greed and gross manipulation of the rules should not be
rewarded).
<P></P>
Examples:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> If the wizard <I>wishes</I> for an entire castle of his own, the DM might have the castle appear in
mid-air, then crash to the ground in a heap of rubble.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> If the wizard <I>wishes</I> &quot;to never again suffer damage from bladed weapons,&quot; the DM might turn him
into a stone statue.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> If the wizard <I>wishes</I> for a dragon to vanish, the dragon might pop out of sight, then abruptly
reappear in another location, perhaps a few yards from the dragon's original
position.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> If the wizard <I>wishes</I> for a fortune in gold, the DM might teleport this fortune from a king's
private treasure vault. The king will then send his best men to arrest the thieving
wizard.
<P></P>
<P></P>
The DM is responsible for determining the components, duration, casting time,
and area of effect each time a <I>wish</I> is to be cast. The DM should first determine what effect the wizard intends
to achieve with his <I>wish</I>, then decide the components, casting time, and so forth, basing his decisions
on his limitations for <I>wishes</I> in his campaign. The elements should be logical and reasonable. Here are some
guidelines:
<P></P>
<B>Components:</B> <I>Wishes</I> have only verbal components. Keep them simple. A short, spoken phrase is
usually sufficient.
<P></P>
<B>Duration:</B> In most cases, the effects of a <I>wish</I> will be permanent. The DM should decide in advance if there are any
exceptions.
<P></P>
<B>Casting Time:</B> If the <I>wish</I> mimics the function of another spell, use that spell's casting time as a
guideline, perhaps making it a little longer if the wish effect is significantly
more powerful than the mimicked spell. For instance, if a <I>wish</I> is used to <I>teleport</I> a party (as described above), note that the <I>teleport without error</I> spell has a casting time of 1. Since the <I>wish</I> has a more powerful effect, a casting time of 4 or 5 for a teleporting <I>wish</I> is appropriate. When in doubt, use the casting times for other 9th-level
spells as guidelines, or use a casting time of 1 round.
<P></P>
<B>Area of Effect:</B> In most cases, common sense will determine the area of effect. For instance,
if a <I>wish</I> is to be used to heal damage, the affected persons should be within sight of
the caster. The DM can be reasonably generous with areas of effect. If the
caster <I>wishes</I> for 5,000 gp to be deposited in a chest 1,000 miles away, that is within
reason. As an example of how all of these elements might be determined, imagine
that the wizard <I>wishes</I> to <I>teleport</I> himself and his party to the wizard's home town. The DM determines the
elements of the spell as follows:
<P></P>
Verbal Component: Speak the name of the desired location.
<P></P>
Duration: Instantaneous.
<P></P>
Casting Time: 1 round.
<P></P>
Area of Effect: All characters within a 20-yard radius of the caster.
