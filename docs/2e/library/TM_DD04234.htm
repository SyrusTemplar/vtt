<P></P>
Range: 30 yards
<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>
Duration: 1 round/level
<P></P>
Casting Time: 7
<P></P>
Area of Effect: 10-foot-radius circle
<P></P>
Saving Throw: Neg.
<P></P>
<P></P>
This spell draws the breath out of all creatures within the area of effect who
fail a saving throw. Their breath is placed within a small silk bag held by
the caster.
<P></P>
Each round, a victim of this spell must attempt a Constitution check. If
failed, the creature suffers 2d4 points of damage. If successful, the subject has
taken in enough air to reduce the damage to 1d4.
<P></P>
As they struggle and gasp for air, affected creatures move and attack at half
their normal rates, have a -4 Armor Class penalty, an attack penalty of -4, and
lose all Dexterity combat bonuses.
<P></P>
Effects of this spell continue each round regardless of whether the victims
remain in the original area of effect. The damage accumulates until the spell
expires, the silk bag is opened, or a successful <I>dispel magic</I> spell is cast upon the bag. The penalties to combat remain in effect for 1d3
rounds after the spell ends.
<P></P>
The material component is a small silk bag studded with black opals worth a
total of no less than 5,000 gp. The bag is not destroyed during casting, but
becomes useless for future castings if a successful dispel magic spell is used on
it.
