When PCs arrive on the scene of an adventure, they represent a major
disruption in the normal course of activity. Foes should respond to this disruption in a
manner consistent with their intelligence and level of organization. Plans and
activities already set in motion should be dropped or altered to meet the
situation.
<P></P>
The worst example of this kind of mistake is the keyed dungeon complex or
castle where the player characters can move from room to room, defeating the
occupants one by one. Such adventures are simple to run, but they lack the depth
needed to challenge high-level characters and keep players entertained. Make sure
the locals react to what the heroes do.
<P></P>
Start by deciding what goes on while the PCs are not present. Note the major
NPC’s daily actions and the general activities of the lesser characters (guards,
servants, visitors). This allows you to establish a routine for the area and
can help determine a proper reaction. An attack during a typical midafternoon,
when the guards are very alert but most of the locals are scattered about the
countryside, is going to create a reaction quite different from that of an attack
made during the week’s major religious observance.
