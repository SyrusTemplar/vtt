This spell imbues the target unit with a temporary burst of courage. To cast
this spell, the priest must have an uninterrupted line of sight to the target
unit.
<P></P>
A <I>courage</I> spell enables a unit to automatically pass its first morale check following
the casting of this spell. When circumstances arise that would necessitate a
morale check, no die roll is made and the unit is assumed to have passed the
check. After this occurs, the spell ends and the unit must make all future morale
checks normally.
<P></P>
If a unit under the influence of a <I>courage</I> spell is not forced to make any morale checks, the spell expires at the first
sunset.
<P></P>
When several different events simultaneously trigger morale checks, the
BATTLESYSTEM? rules apply penalties to a single morale check. If this occurs to a
unit under the influence of a <I>courage</I> spell, the player commanding the unit selects one such event and its modifier
is ignored.
<P></P>
No more than one <I>courage</I> spell can affect a unit at one time. Once the spell has expired, a priest can
cast the spell again on the same unit.
<P></P>
The material component is a cube of cast iron.
