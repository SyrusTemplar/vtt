Hill giants are selfish, cunning brutes who survive through hunting and by
terrorizing and raiding nearby communities. Despite their low intelligence, they
are capable fighters.
<P></P>
Hill giants are oddly simian and barbaric in appearance, with overly long
arms, stooped shoulders, and low foreheads. Even though they are the smallest of
the giants, their limbs are more muscular and massive than those of the other
giant races. The average hill giant is 16 feet tall and weighs about 4,500 pounds.
Females have the same builds as males. Their skin color ranges from a light
tan to a deep ruddy brown. Their hair is brown or black, and their eyes are
black. Hill giants can live to be 200 years old.
<P></P>
Hill giants' natural Armor Class is 5. This is reduced to an Armor Class of 3
when they wear crudely-sewn animal hides, which are the equivalent of leather
armor. Nearly all hill giants wear these hides, which are a symbol of esteem in
some hill giant communities -- the more hides a giant has, the more large kills
to his credit. Only a few (5%) of the giants fashion metal armor from the
armor of men they have defeated. These giants have an Armor Class of 0. Like other
races of giants, hill giants carry their belongings with them in huge hide
sacks. A typical hill giant's bag will contain 2-8 (2d4) throwing rocks, the
giant's wealth, and 1-8 additional common items.
<P></P>
Hill giants speak their own language and a tongue common to all giants. In
addition, 50% also speak ogre.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Hill giants prefer to fight their opponents from high rocky outcroppings where
they can pelt their targets with rocks and boulders while limiting the risks
posed to themselves.
<P></P>
Hill giants' favorite weapons are oversized clubs which do 2-12 +7 points of
damage (double the damage of a man-sized club plus their strength bonus). They
hurl rocks for 2-16 (2d8) points of damage. Their targets for such attacks must
be between 3 and 200 yards away from the giant. They can catch rocks or other
similar missiles 30% of the time.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A hill giant lair will have 9-16 (1d8+8) giants; usually an extended family.
Sometimes these families will accept lone hill giants into their folds. If six
or more giants are encountered in a lair, half of them will be male, one quarter
will be female, and the remainder will be immature giants. To determine a
giant's maturity, roll 1d4. A roll of 4 indicates an infant with no combat ability
and hit points of gnoll; rolls of 1-3 indicate older progeny with hit dice,
damage, and attack rolls equal to that of an ogre.
<P></P>
Occasionally a hill giant with an average intelligence can be found. Such a
giant is capable of rallying bands of his peers so 2, 3, or 4 times the number of
giants usually appearing can be encountered. These &quot;giant kings,&quot; as they call
themselves, stage raids on human towns or against other races of giants.
<P></P>
Although hill giants prefer temperate areas, they can be found in practically
any climate where there is an abundance of hills and mountains. They lair in
caves, excavated dens, or crude huts. Those who live in colder climates have
developed more skills with preparing and using skins to keep themselves warm and to
keep the harsh winds out of their lairs.
<P></P>
There is a 50% chance a band of hill giants will have guards in their lairs,
and the guarding creatures will be 2-8 (2d4) <A HREF="DD04088.htm#7bf78283"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD04088.htm#7bf78283">dire wolves</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> (50%), 1-3 <A HREF="DD03976.htm#02dd8e0b"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03976.htm#02dd8e0b">giant lizards</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> (30%), or a group of 2-8 (2d4) <A HREF="DD04018.htm#70d32af6"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD04018.htm#70d32af6">ogres</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> (20%).
<P></P>
The majority of hill giants are suspicious of magic and will seek to destroy
magic items they acquire as treasure. They ceremonially kill mages.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Hill giants' main diet consists of meat, which they obtain by hunting. The
flesh of young green dragons is considered a delicacy, and frequently giants who
live on hills and mountains covered with forests will organize hunting parties
in search of green dragon lairs. In turn, green dragons have been known to hunt
hill giants.
<P></P>
Sometimes bands of hill giants will trade with each other or with bands of
ogres to get foodstuffs and trinkets.
