The traditionalist takes pride in the old ways and opposes change for the sake
of change. This mindset applies to alterations in land use, shifts in the
structure of the druidic order, and fluctuations in the pattern of daily life in
the character's region.

The traditionalist's philosophy means the druid vehemently opposes destroying
the wilderness to replace it with crops, towns, or mines. Of course, he stands
equally against radical druids like Shadow Circle members, who advocate the
destruction of towns or cities. (However, some clever Shadow Circle members use a
traditionalist facade.)
<P></P>
Traditionalist druids usually think things were better in the past and talk
incessantly about how the present doesn't match ancient glories. They take pride
in the history and accomplishments of the druidic order and usually have the
ancient history nonweapon proficiency. A traditionalist believes unshakably in
the basic tenets of druidism, such as protecting the wilderness and maintaining
the balance of Nature, as well as protecting druidic customs, such as the
challenge. Often the character takes an active interest in druidic politics to make
sure that suitably tradition-minded druids find their way to high-ranking
positions.
<P></P>
Almost any druid kit suits a traditionalist personality, provided the Order
has an ancient history. On the other hand, say the DM decides that druids have
developed the powers of the Shapeshifter kit only recently. In such a campaign, a
traditionalist would avoid that kit.
