This spell holds 1d4 humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly
immobile and in place for a minimum of six rounds (the spell lasts 2 rounds per caster
level, and the priest must be of at least 3rd level to cast the spell).
<P></P>
The <I>hold person</I> spell affects any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man size or
smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins,
half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies,
orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could
be held, while an ogre could not.
<P></P>
The effect is centered on a point selected by the caster, and it affects
persons selected by the caster within the area of effect. If the spell is cast at
three persons, each gets a normal saving throw; if only two persons are being
enspelled, each rolls his saving throw with a -1 penalty; if the spell is cast at
only one person, the saving throw die roll suffers a -2 penalty. Saving throws
are adjusted for Wisdom. Those who succeed on their saving throws are totally
unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.
<P></P>
Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around
them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not
prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or
poison. The priest casting the <I>hold person</I> spell can end the spell with a single utterance at any time; otherwise, the
duration is six rounds at 3rd level, eight rounds at 4th level, etc.
<P></P>
The spellcaster needs a small, straight piece of iron as the material
component of this spell.
