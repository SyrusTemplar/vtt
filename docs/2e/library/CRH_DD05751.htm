   Rangers manifest their faith in a number of ways:

   A ranger's devotion gives him a sense of purpose, a feeling that his life has
a purpose. Even though his role may seem at times to be minor, he feels that he
has a definite place in the scheme of things.

   A ranger's beliefs give structure to his life by providing a set of principles
for him to follow. Being of good alignment, rangers tend to adopt beliefs that
encourage honesty, compassion, and selflessness.

   In practical terms, the access to spells enjoyed by the high level ranger is
one of the most immediate and visible results of a life of service. Much like a
druid, the ranger receives his spells as a consequence of his beliefs. Though
prayer or meditation, the ranger asks for the spells he wishes to memorize, and
in most cases, his requests are granted.
<P></P>
   Unlike the druid and other priests, the ranger's access to spells is limited.
A priest, after all, devotes much energy to the service of his faith, while a
ranger's other activities and duties place great demands on his time. For this
reason, the ranger is able to acquire spells only when he reaches 8th level, and
then has only minor access to the plant and animal spheres. The ranger can
fill his spell slots with any spells of the appropriate level listed for those
spheres. Some kits may have expanded or restricted spell use.
