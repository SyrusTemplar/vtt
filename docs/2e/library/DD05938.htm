Unless there are special reasons to the contrary, the base morale for
guildmembers will be 15 to begin with. If morale falls below this level, a morale check
is called for. Failing the check means that 1d2 thieves leave the guild, to
become freelancers elsewhere. This number can be modified. For each 2 points that
morale falls below 14, add 1 extra deserter. If the 2d10 roll is 19 or 20
(natural; this is but a 3% chance), add an extra 1d4 deserters. Do not add
alignment modifiers (for the PC) to these morale checks; standard morale checks (<A HREF="PHB_DD01463.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01463.htm">Table 16</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">,<I> Player's Handbook</I>) give bonuses for being lawful/good and this is extremely implausible with
thieves!
<P></P>
As an alternative, rather than leaving the guild, the thieves may put their
grievances to the guildmaster, if a secret check against the guildmaster's
Charisma is successful. They may ask for lower dues or cuts from their income, more
resources from the guild, or as the DM determines. This is a fair step, if
morale has fallen due to ill-fortune (arrests and other problems) rather than to the
guildmaster having been reckless or careless.
<P></P>
If morale falls to 5 or lower, however, the guildmaster will be the subject of
an open revolt and attempted putsch (and, at the DM's discretion, this may
happen sooner if the PC is being cruel, arbitrary, reckless, or otherwise abusing
his position).
