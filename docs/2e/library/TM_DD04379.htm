This spell allows the caster to cause any dragon to temporarily gain or lose
one age level per five levels of the caster. For instance, a 14th-level caster
could cause a dragon to gain or lose two age levels; a mature adult dragon could
be temporarily transformed into a young adult dragon or into a very old
dragon. A dragon's age cannot be reduced below hatchling or increased beyond great
wyrm.
<P></P>
Unwilling dragons are allowed a saving throw vs. spells with a -4 penalty to
avoid the effect.
<P></P>
A dragon affected by <I>age dragon</I> temporarily acquires the armor class, hit points, spell abilities, combat
modifiers, size, and other attributes of his new age level. The dragon retains his
memories and personality. At the end of the spell's duration, the dragon
returns to his normal age level.
<P></P>
If the dragon suffered damage while experiencing his modified age, these hit
points remain lost when he resumes his normal age. If the dragon loses more hit
points at his modified age than he has at his actual age, he dies when the
spell expires. For example, a young adult bronze dragon with 110 hit points is aged to a
mature adult with 120 hit points. The dragon suffers 115 hit points in combat.
Unless the dragon is healed of 6 points of damage before the spell expires, the
dragon dies at the end of the spell since his damage is greater than his actual
hit points.
<P></P>
If a dragon is killed while under the effect of <I>age dragon</I>, he is dead at the end of the spell's duration.
<P></P>
The material component is a handful of dirt taken from a dragon's footprint.
