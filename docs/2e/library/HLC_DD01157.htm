Pay equal attention to the creature?s strong points and find ways to maximize
them. Intelligently played monsters can wreak havoc on even the most
well-prepared group of high-level heroes. Start by identifying their strengths and then
formulate plans to take advantage of them. For example:

retreat and regenerate lost hit points while the fresh troops press the fight.

such as rolling boulders onto opponents from atop a cliff.

<IMG SRC="AEG_DD90000.gif" ALT="DD90000.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="17"> <IMG SRC="AEG_DD90000.gif" ALT="DD90000.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="17"> Trolls armed with magical weapons, such as two-handed swords, could
successfully attack characters with low Armor Classes and do considerable damage in the
process (their damage bonus when using weapons is +8).

<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> <FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Everybody knows that vampires drain life energy, but they have a vast
repertoire of powers including high mobility, various spell and weapon immunities, high
Strength scores, formidable charm ability, and can conceal themselves by
posing as normal humans or demihumans.

<IMG SRC="AEG_DD90000.gif" ALT="DD90000.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="17"> <IMG SRC="AEG_DD90000.gif" ALT="DD90000.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="17"> A vampire is at its best when it can attack a lone, high-level PC. One-on-one
confrontations give the vampire a chance to use its charm gaze and attempt
melee without fear of an overwhelming spell assault or clerical turning attempt.

<IMG SRC="AEG_DD90000.gif" ALT="DD90000.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="17"> <IMG SRC="AEG_DD90000.gif" ALT="DD90000.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="17"> A vampire can only be hit by magical weapons, so protecting itself with spells
like <I>invulnerability to magical weapons</I> or<I> antimagic shell</I> allow the vampire to wear down high-level warriors without fear of the PCs?
blades slicing through it.
<P></P>
<IMG SRC="AEG_DD90000.gif" ALT="DD90000.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="17"> <IMG SRC="AEG_DD90000.gif" ALT="DD90000.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="17"> In a high-level campaign, mobility is the vampire?s greatest power. (<I>Scarabs of protection</I> and spells such as <I>negative plane protection</I> and <I>restoration</I> make level-draining undead considerably less formidable than they are in
campaigns where the PCs have fewer resources.)
<P></P>

few pinholes in a wall, floor, or ceiling that has been reinforced with metal
bars (to defeat <I>passwall </I>spells) allows a vampire to come and go as it pleases.

<IMG SRC="AEG_DD90000.gif" ALT="DD90000.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="17"> <IMG SRC="AEG_DD90000.gif" ALT="DD90000.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="17"> Time is also a vampire?s ally, especially if it is deep underground where it
doesn?t have to worry about natural sunlight. If forced to retreat, a vampire
can spend some time regenerating, then return?at full hit points?to harry its
enemies from a new angle.
<P></P>
<IMG SRC="AEG_DD90000.gif" ALT="DD90000.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="17"> <IMG SRC="AEG_DD90000.gif" ALT="DD90000.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="17"> The vampire might pose as a resident from a nearby village who is here to slay
the vampire. Players are not likely to recognize a vampire for what it is if
the monster is running round with a wooden stake and mallet in hand.

Giant slugs have endless supplies of acidic spittle, immunity to blunt
weapons, and boneless bodies that can fit through small openings.
<P></P>
Repeated acid attacks can wear down even the strongest characters, and the
acid has a chance (however small) to destroy magical items and make high-level PCs
a little less formidable.
<P></P>
<I>Stoneskin</I> can protect the slug from weapon attacks for a brief time, giving it more
time to wear down the PCs. A <I>spell engine</I> could be setup nearby to absorb spells, or a <I>chain contingency</I> could be in place on the slug to activate spells like <I>fire shield</I> (cold version),<I> lightning bolt</I>, and other unexpected surprises.
<P></P>
A giant slug?s ability to squeeze into small places allows it to lie in wait
for the PCs in a place that appears empty at first glance.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Minimizing weaknesses and maximizing strengths allows you to challenge the PCs
and maintain tension without power inflation; foes become slightly harder to
kill and a little more challenging in a fight.
<P></P>
There are other advantages as well. Players with high-level characters often
are veteran players who are very familiar with most AD&amp;D game monsters. Their
encyclopedic knowledge allows them to strike immediately at a monster?s weak
point, easily defeating the creature. If you take pains to minimize monsters?
weaknesses and exploit their strengths, you encourage your players to think
creatively by providing a new challenge (thinking of a way to exploit the shielded
weakness or avoid the amplified strength). You also restore some freshness to your
campaign, because the players quickly learn that all monsters are not exactly
alike. Since the players are no longer certain how much danger they face, they
learn to respect the offensive capabilities of any creature they meet, which
encourages them to consider alternatives to fighting.
