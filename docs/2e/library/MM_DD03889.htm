Feyrs (pronounced &quot;fears&quot;) are created from the remnants of ordinary
nightmares, mixed with residual magical energies, and unknowingly brought to life by the
strong emotions of a large group of people. They are most commonly found in
large cities that have a good number of mages, priests, and other spell-casters.
Normal feyrs stalk the streets at night, seeking nothing more than to create
havoc. Great feyrs, on the other hand, are the combination of lesser feyrs, and
may be found anywhere, though they a much rarer than the common feyrs.
<P></P>
Common feyrs appear as humped, hunchbacked creatures, grim and inhuman in
appearance. Their hide is mottled and warped like the surface of the human brain.
The creature is supported by two main tentacles which act as legs, and by a
handful of other tentacled limbs. Massive horizontal jaws line its underside, and
the forepart of the beast has 1-5 eyes, usually the color of melted gold. The
feyr's hide is a sickly rainbow of shades, like light reflected off an oil slick.
There are dull blues and blacks along the body, pale reds and magentas toward
the head, and deathly greens and yellows along the belly.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The horizontal jaws of the feyr slung beneath its belly are the creature's
prime form of attack, inflicting 1d4 points of damage for common feyrs, 2d6 points
for great feyrs. The feyr does not use its jaws to eat, but rather to strike
terror into the hearts of those who witness its savage and bloody attacks. Those
who witness the attack of either type of feyr must make a successful saving
throw vs. <I>spells</I> or be consumed by <I>fear</I> (as the spell of the same name). This <I>fear</I> acts for 1d4 rounds for common feyrs, and 2d6 rounds for great feyrs. This
form of <I>fear</I> only applies when the creature attacks. Merely sighting a common feyr does
not inspire <I>fear</I>.
<P></P>
The great feyr has an additional power that can affect the emotions similar to
the 4th-level wizard spell <I>emotion</I>. The range of this attack is 100 yards, may affect a 20-foot by 20-foot area,
and the intended victim must make a successful saving throw vs. <I>spells</I> at -2 or be affected. Only the negative emotions of <I>fear, hate, hopelessness</I>, and <I>sadness</I> may be cast by the great feyr. The great feyr may cast this spell and retain
its <I>invisibility</I>.
<P></P>
Common feyrs are slain by direct sunlight, though they have no fear of it
themselves, and do not seek shelter with the coming sun, nor hesitate to venture
out if they are still alive after sun-up. Common feyrs can use a saving throw vs.
spells against sunlight created by magic spells, such as <I>continual light</I>, in addition to their standard magic resistance. Greater feyrs are unaffected
by sunlight.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Individual common feyrs are slain by the morning light. There are occasions
when several common feyrs combine to form a great feyr, which in addition to
being immune to the effects of the sun, is much more intelligent. The greater feyr
seeks to inspire even stronger emotions, which it may then use to stay alive.
While common feyrs do not travel far from their point of origin, great feyrs may
undertake long trips, lured by strong emotional states.
<P></P>
While a common feyr merely slouches through the evening shadows and fogs,
looking for a collection of victims to terrorize and thereby enrich itself on their
emotions, a great feyr chooses to attack while <I>invisible</I>, playing the emotions of others, heightening emotional states already
present, and driving mortal beings mad with terror and fear. While the great feyr is
not banished by daylight, it prefers to work at night, and seeks to retreat into
a hidden lair during daylight hours, preferably some abandoned area such as an
old house, cavern, or underground structure.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Common feyrs are created by the emotions of large masses of people, and great
feyrs by compilations of lesser feyrs. The raw materials for such creatures may
be found in any urban settlement, and when there is additional tension in the
air, the feyrs stalk at night. Cities under siege, towns divided by rivalries
or civil wars, oppressed peoples, and settlements baking under a merciless
summer heat are all possible breeding grounds of feyrs. Guard and watch units are
usually more than sufficient to handle the common feyrs, as those feyrs attack
anything that moves. But the more dangerous great feyrs must be dealt with by a
wizard or similar high-level individual, who can both withstand the attack of
the feyr and dispatch it.
