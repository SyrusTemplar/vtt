Each wizard kit consists of a variety of elements.
<P></P>
<B>Description:</B> This section explains the cultural background, appearance, and manner of
characters associated with this kit. It also lists any requirements necessary for
characters taking the kit; for instance, characters taking the Amazon Sorceress
kit must be female. Suggestions are also given for how a character might
abandon the kit.
<P></P>
<B>Preferred Schools:</B> This lists which specialists are most appropriate to the kit. As explained in
the <I>Kits and Schools of Magic</I> section above, there are many exceptions, and these should be considered
suggestions only.
<P></P>
Chapter 1 outlined an ethos for each school, suggesting philosophies,
attitudes, and personality traits for each specialist. When designing a character, the
player should compare the personality traits and attitudes of the character's
school with those of his kit. If a conflict arises, the player can choose
whichever traits and attitudes he prefers, or whichever seem to make the most sense
for his character. For instance, according to the abjurer's ethos in Chapter 1,
an abjurer tends to be gentle and soft-spoken. However, a player who chooses
the Amazon Sorceress kit may decide that his Amazon Sorceress abjurer is
out-going and boisterous, as is appropriate to the Amazonian culture of his campaign
world. With the DM's permission, an out-going, boisterous Amazon Sorceress
abjurer is perfectly acceptable.
<P></P>
In general, a character's cultural background will have more influence on his
personality than his school. Therefore, if a player cannot decide between the
personality traits associated with his school's ethos and the traits associated
with his character's kit, he should give more emphasis to the kit traits.
<P></P>
<B>Barred Schools:</B> This entry explains which schools are inappropriate for the kit. Though the
DM is free to make exceptions, it is usually not a good idea to assign a kit to
a specialist from a barred school.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> This section describes the role of a particular wizard in his society and in
his campaign. For instance, an Amazon Sorceress has a different cultural role
than a Witch, even if both are enchanters.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> If you're using the Secondary Skills rules from the AD&amp;DÂ® 2nd Edition game
rules, then a kit may require a character to take a specific skill instead of
choosing or rolling randomly for it. (When choosing kits for characters, we
suggest you use the Weapon and Nonweapon Proficiency rules instead of the Secondary
Skills rules.)
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> If you are using the Weapon Proficiency rules from the AD&amp;D 2nd Edition game,
this entry indicates which Weapon Proficiency is required for characters
taking this kit. In some cases, a specific Weapon Proficiency is required; in other
cases, a Weapon Proficiency can be chosen from among a list of recommended
proficiencies.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> If you are using the Nonweapon Proficiency rules, this entry indicates
whether specific Nonweapon Proficiencies are required for characters taking this kit.
However, unlike Weapon Proficiencies, the Nonweapon Proficiencies are bonuses.
If a kit requires that the character must have Astrology, then the character
gets that proficiency free, above and beyond the slots he is normally granted.
Even if such proficiencies belong to groups other than the Wizard or General
groups, the character still gets them as bonuses at no charge.
<P></P>
If the kit grants a Nonweapon Proficiency that the wizard already has because
of his specialization, the character receives instead one extra free Nonweapon
Proficiency slot. He may spend this free slot on any specialization of his
choice.
<P></P>
Some Nonweapon Proficiencies are recommended, not required. In such cases, the
character is not required to take the proficiency if he does not want it. If
he takes a recommended proficiency, he spends the normal number of his available
proficiency slots.

groups that apply to mages and illusionists also apply to specialists from all
other schools; that is, any specialist selecting a Nonweapon Proficiency from the
Wizard or General groups shown on <A HREF="PHB_DD01538.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01538.htm">Table 37</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> (page 54-55 of the<I> PH</I> ) spends the listed number of proficiency slots. When any specialist selects
a proficiency from any other category, he must spend one additional slot beyond
the number listed (exceptions are given in the Nonweapon Proficiencies entries
for the various kits).
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> Some wizard types tend to use specific equipment. Others have limitations or
restrictions on the way they acquire or use equipment. This entry details the
equipment employed by characters using this kit. (In no case is a wizard allowed
to purchase armor.)
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> Most kits grant special benefits to characters. Often, these benefits are
defined as special reaction bonuses when encountering certain classes of society,
or as special rights in specific cultures.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> Each kit carries certain disadvantages to hinder the wizard. Often, these are
reaction penalties or cultural restrictions.
<P></P>
<B>Wealth Options:</B> Some wizard types have special rules regarding their wealth. Usually, these
rules specify differences in the amount of money received when the character is
created and limitations on how the money can be spent.
<P></P>
<B>Races:</B> If a kit is not available to particular races, this will be noted here.
Unless the DM makes exceptions for his campaign, humans can choose any of the kits.
