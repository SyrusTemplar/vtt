The Hivemaster druid lives to foster insectoid and arachnid life wherever it
exists. Most low-level Hivemasters, such as Cagua (pictured on the next page)
work as beekeepers or the like.
<P></P>
<B>Role: </B>Hivemasters appear somewhat enigmatic. Many attempt to instill insectoid
virtues in their followers, such as patience, hard work, and close cooperation. Some
higher-level Hivemasters even attempt to influence human societies to adopt a
communal pattern modeled on that of hive insects. Others--often styling
themselves Webmasters--take on the patient, deadly personas of predator arachnids or
insects such as dragonflies or spiders, ruthlessly hunting down (or lying in
wait to trap) the enemies of the druidic order. A Hivemaster--s grove usually
centers around the dwelling place of the creature for which the druid has the
greatest affinity--a forest covered with spider webs, a field with beehives, etc.

<B>Branch Restrictions:</B> None.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Recommended</I>-- scimitar, staff.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> Farmer, woodworker/carpenter.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Recommended</I>--(general) agriculture; (warrior) animal lore, endurance, set snares.
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> The druid should spend her initial allotment of gold pieces entirely on
equipment, as she loses any unspent starting money in excess of 1 gp.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> A Hivemaster receives a +4 bonus to saving throws against stings or bites of
poisonous insects or arachnids, including giant versions.
<P></P>
The druid also gains a +4 bonus on agriculture, animal training, and animal
lore proficiency checks concerning insects or arachnids, and can apply the animal
training proficiency to giant insects and arachnids.
<P></P>
A Hivemaster like Cagua may pass harmlessly through spider webs of all sorts,
including webs created by the <I>web </I>spell. When she casts a <I>summon insects</I>, <I>giant insect</I>, <I>creeping doom</I>, or <I>insect plague</I> spell, the player increases her effective level by three.
<P></P>
Upon reaching 7th level, the druid gains the ability to shapechange into a
giant insect or arachnid type once per day. She can take the form of a
nonpoisonous giant ant, giant centipede, giant spider, or giant wasp. The Hivemaster may
assume this insectoid form instead of one of her other shapechanging choices
(bird, mammal, or reptile). For example, Cagua may choose to avoid the bird form
today in favor of the insectoid form, but tomorrow she may decide not to
shapechange into reptile form. The druid still can assume only three forms per day,
just like the normal druidic shapechanging ability. Note: Gray druids with the
Hivemaster kit may assume the insectoid form instead of any one of their usual
shapechanging choices: mammal, reptile, or nonpoisonous giant spider.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> The Hivemaster's <I>animal friendship, speak with animals</I>, and <I>summon animals</I> spells allow her to summon or communicate with only insects, giant insects,
or arachnids. Hivemasters receive a -3 penalty when using animal proficiencies
(animal lore, animal training, etc.) on creatures that are not insects or
arachnids.
<P></P>
<B>Wealth Options:</B> 3d6-10 gp.
