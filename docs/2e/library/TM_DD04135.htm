The most broad-reaching aspect of the wild mage's powers is his approach to
spells. The wild mage's work with the principles of uncertainty affects all
spells that have a level variable for range, duration, area of effect, or damage.
Each time a wild mage uses a spell with a level variable, he randomly determines
the resulting casting level of the spell. The spell may function at lesser,
equal, or greater effect than normal. The degree of variation depends on the true
level of the caster, as shown in
<P></P>
To determine the level at which the spell is cast, the player must roll 1d20
at the moment the spell is cast. The variation from the caster's actual level is
found at the point where the character's true level and the die roll
intersect. (True level refers to the current experience level of the wild mage.) If the
result is a positive number, that many levels are added to the caster's true
level for purposes of casting the spell. If the result is a negative number, that
many levels are subtracted from the caster's true level. If the result is 0,
the spell is cast normally. The variation of a spell's power has no permanent
effect on the mage's experience level or casting ability.
<P></P>
For example, Theos, a 7th-level wild mage, casts a <I>fireball</I>. He wishes it to take effect 70 yards away at the site of a band of advancing
orcs.<I> Fireball</I> has level variables for range (10 yds.+10 yds./level) and damage (1d6/level).
A die roll is made on the <A HREF="DD04134.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD04134.htm">Level Variation Table</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> with a result of 19, indicating a level variation of +3. The <I>fireball</I> functions as if cast by a 10th-level wizard (7+3) and easily reaches its
target, causing 10d6 points of damage. If the level variation had been -3 (die roll
of 2), the spell would have operated as if it were 4th level. In this case,
the <I>fireball</I> would have fallen short since its maximum range would have been 50 yards (10
yds+ 10 yds 1d4).
<P></P>
One additional effect can occur when casting level-variable spells. If the
result from <A HREF="DD04134.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD04134.htm">Table 1</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> is boldfaced, the caster has inadvertently created a <I>wild surge</I> in the spell in addition to the spell's effects. A wild surge briefly opens a
doorway through which raw magical energy pours. The energy is incompletely
controlled by the actions of the spellcaster. The result, often spectacular, is
seldom what the caster intended and is sometimes a smaller or greater version of
the desired spell. At other times, wildly improbable results occur. Songs may
fill the air, people might appear out of nowhere, or the floor may become a pool
of grease. Whatever happens, it is the essence of wildness.
<P></P>
When a wild surge occurs, the DM must roll on <A HREF="DD04136.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD04136.htm">Table 2</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. Unlike many other instances in the AD&amp;D? game in which the DM is encouraged
to choose a suitable result, wild surges are best resolved by random chance.
Actively choosing a result biases the nature of wild magic. DMs are encouraged to
be random and have fun.
