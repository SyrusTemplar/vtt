Group: Warrior, Rogue Initial rating: 7

Characters with this talent are blessed with an innate sense of balance and
have an uncanny knack for keeping their feet under them. With a successful
proficiency check, the character gains a +2 bonus on any climbing checks, saving
throws, or ability checks to avoid slipping or falling. In addition, the character
reduces any penalties for fighting in off-balance or awkward situations by 2
points.
<P></P>
The fine balance talent is also very useful for tightrope walking, tumbling,
and climbing walls. If the DM determines that a particular feat would be
influenced by the characterâ€™s exceptional balance, the character gains a +2 (on d20
rolls) or +10% (on d100 rolls) bonus to his rolls to resolve the action.
