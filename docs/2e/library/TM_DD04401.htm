The imago is a mental image--a form of mental magical body. After casting this
spell (requiring 1 turn), the caster falls asleep. After 1d6 turns of sleep,
the imago of the priest begins to travel. The imago is not subject to any forms
of attack and has no effective attacks.
<P></P>
The imago may travel to as many as four different locations separated by any
distance, even across the planes and/or backward in time. At these locations,
the imago may interrogate the imagos of as many as 10 other sentient creatures
(other than Powers), compelling them to reply truthfully to its questions. A
maximum of 40 questions may be asked during the spell duration.
<P></P>
Asking one question and listening to the reply takes 4 rounds of time in the
caster's world. Each planar/time jump lasts 3 turns in that world.
<P></P>
Imago communications are telepathic. The questions must be able to be answered
in a sentence of reasonable length, or the interrogated creature becomes
confused and cannot answer.
<P></P>
The imagos of interrogated creatures will have no recollection of their
interrogations. As a result, history cannot be changed through backward time travel
using this spell.
