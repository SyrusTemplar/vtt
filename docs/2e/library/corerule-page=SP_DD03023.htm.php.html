<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Animal Lore:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Adventurers with animal lore have a store of knowledge about animal behavior,
and without any proficiency check will know the basic feeding and social
habits (i.e. herding, nesting, etc.) of animals with which they have past experience.
<P></P>
With a proficiency check, a character can determine whether an observed animal
is intending to attack or to flee, or predict that animals will come along a
trail at a certain time of day. This character gets a +2 bonus to checks made
using the set snares proficiency.
<P></P>
The character can imitate the calls of wild animals (except for very large
creatures). A successful check means that the imitation is virtually perfect, and
even fools animals of the same type. A failed check might fool other
characters, but will not deceive the animals.
