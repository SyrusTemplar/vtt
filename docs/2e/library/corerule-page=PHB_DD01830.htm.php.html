The gestures of the wizard, along with his droning incantation, cause 1d6
creatures within the area to become susceptible to a suggestion--a brief and
reasonable-sounding request (see the 3rd-level wizard <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01926.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01926.htm.php.html">suggestion</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> spell). The request must be given after the <I>hypnotism</I> spell is cast. Until that time, the success of the spell is unknown. Note
that the subsequent suggestion is not a spell, but simply a vocalized urging (the
caster must speak a language the creature understands for this spell to work).
Creatures that successfully roll their saving throws are not under hypnotic
influence. Those who are exceptionally wary or hostile save with +1 to +3 bonuses.
If the spell is cast at an individual creature that meets the caster's gaze,
the saving throw is made with a penalty of -2. A creature that fails its saving
throw does not remember that the caster enspelled it.
