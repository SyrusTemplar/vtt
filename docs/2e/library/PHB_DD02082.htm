A <I>binding</I> spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature, usually from another
plane of existence. Extraplanar creatures must be confined by a circular diagram;
other creatures can be physically confined. The duration of the spell depends
upon the form of the binding and the level of the caster(s), as well as the
length of time the spell is actually uttered. The components vary according to the
form of the spell, but they include a continuous chanting utterance read from
the scroll or book page giving the spell; gestures appropriate to the form of
binding; and materials such as miniature chains of special metal (silver for
lycanthropes, etc.), soporific herbs of the rarest sort, a corundum or diamond gem
of great size (1,000 gp value per Hit Die of the subject creature), and a
vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured.
<P></P>
Magic resistance applies unless the subject's true name is used. A saving
throw is not applicable as long as the experience level of the caster is at least
twice as great as the Hit Dice of the subject. The caster's level can be
augmented by one-third of the levels of each assisting wizard of 9th level or higher,
and by one level for each assistant of 4th through 8th level. No more than six
other wizards can assist with this spell. If the caster's level is less than
twice the Hit Dice of the subject, the subject gains a saving throw vs. spell,
modified by the form of binding being attempted. The various forms of binding are:
<P></P>
<I>Chaining:</I> The subject is confined by restraints that generate an <I>antipathy</I> spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except the caster.
Duration is as long as one year per level of the caster(s). The subject of this
form of binding (as well as in the slumber and bound slumber versions) remains
within the restraining barrier.
<P></P>
<I>Slumber:</I> Brings a comatose sleep upon the subject for a duration of up to one year per
level of the caster(s).
<P></P>
<I>Bound Slumber:</I> A combination of chaining and slumber that lasts for up to one month per
level of the caster(s).
<P></P>
<I>Hedged Prison:</I> The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area
from which it cannot wander by any means until freed. The spell remains until the
magical hedge is somehow broken.
<P></P>
<I>Metamorphosis:</I> Causes the subject to change to some noncorporeal form, save for its head or
face. The binding is permanent until some prescribed act frees the subject.
<P></P>
<I>Minimus Containment:</I> The subject is shrunken to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within
the hedged prison of some gem or similar object. The subject of a minimus
containment, metamorphosis, or hedged prison radiates a very faint aura of magic.
<P></P>
The subject of the chaining form of the spell receives a saving throw with no
modifications. However, slumber allows the subject a +1 bonus, bound slumber a
+2 bonus, hedged prison a +3 bonus, metamorphosis a +4 bonus, and minimus
containment a +5 bonus to the saving throw. If the subject is magically weakened,
the DM can assign a -1, -2, or even -4 penalty to the saving throw. A successful
saving throw enables the subject to burst its bonds and do as it pleases.
<P></P>
A <I>binding</I> spell can be renewed in the case of the first three forms of the spell, for
the subject does not have the opportunity to break the bonds. (If anything has
caused a weakening of a chaining or slumber version, such as attempts to contact
the subject or magically touch it, a normal saving throw applies to the
renewal of the spell.) Otherwise, after one year, and each year thereafter, the
subject gains a normal saving throw vs. the spell. Whenever it is successful, the <I>binding</I> spell is broken and the creature is free.
