Magic and Story Telling </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When it comes down to it, an AD&amp;D adventure is nothing more than a story
created by the DM and embellished upon by the players. Every campaign generates
volumes of epic confrontations, cliffhangers, and sinister villains—it’s just the
way the game is played. Magic is often the central feature of these campaign
stories; most players couldn’t tell you a thing about Joe’s paladin, but everyone
who was at the game remembers the time Joe’s paladin found the <I>holy avenger</I>! An enormous number of player characters are remembered fondly not for their
personalities or the skill with which they were played, but instead the
particular magical items they owned and the nifty tricks they had with their spell
selections.
<P></P>
While this isn’t necessarily bad, it can detract from the role-playing
elements of a game if the players and the DM allow it to. After all, when the only
tool you have is a hammer, everything starts looking like a nail—and if you’ve got
a <I>flame tongue </I>sword, it looks like the answer to any problem is going to involve slashing
and burning <I>something</I>. Similarly, a wizard whose most memorable achievement is his invention of <I>Alkair’s inescapable decapitation </I>and subsequent use of the spell in every encounter for the rest of the
campaign isn’t really a well-developed character at all. A hero with a magical sword
is fine, but when the magical sword <I>defines </I>the hero, the hero is diminished.
<P></P>
Another difficulty that arises in many campaigns is the substitution of magic
for technology. AD&amp;D game players are (quite naturally) creatures of the modern
world, and modern conveniences such as automobiles, tanks, telephones,
televisions, computers, and any number of other devices seem so indispensable that
there just <I>have </I>to be magical equivalents. While some of this is fine in any campaign, it
desensitizes both players and DMs to the sheer wonder that magic should inspire in
most characters. After all, magic should be <I>magical</I>, full of mystery and terror, but when a character routinely uses magic to
brush his teeth and stir his stew, magic becomes nothing more than a tool.
Blurring the distinction between magic and technology detracts from the strength of
both philosophies.
<P></P>
Last, but not least, it’s important to remember that magic can do<I> anything </I>that a DM needs it to do for purposes of advancing the plot or elaborating on
an adventure. If the story calls for a greater tanar’ri to be encased in a
glass globe, it’s not necessary to worry about exactly how the tanar’ri was
imprisoned there, or what spells the old archmage used to defeat the creature; it’s
okay for a DM to simply tell the players that the archmage did it. However, PCs
and NPCs who are interacting with the party should follow the rules—up to the
point that the rules interfere with the story.
