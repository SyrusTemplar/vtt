This is the basic action for characters and monsters in a fight. When a
character chooses to attack, he makes his normal hand-held weapon attacks. Characters
and creatures can make a half-move and attack or they can stand their ground
and attack as a no-move action.
<P></P>
Monsters with multiple attacks perform all their attacks on the same phase. If
a dragon attacks with average speed, its bite, claws, tail, and wing buffets
all take place in the average phase of the combat round. Characters using a
weapon in each hand strike in the same fashion, during the action phase of the
slower weapon.
<P></P>
Characters who have multiple attacks with the same weapon (such as high-level
fighters or weapon specialists) make their first attack normally and then make
one attack each phase thereafter until they-ve resolved all of their multiple
attacks. A long sword specialist with two attacks in a round makes his first
attack in the average phase and his second in the slow phase of the round.
<P></P>
Normally, a character can combine a move and an attack only by moving first
and resolving attacks later. However, a character can choose to attack first and
then make a half-move at the end of the round. Note that characters can adjust
their position each time they attack, so a hero with multiple attacks could
attack several creatures standing apart from each other.
<P></P>
Attacks of opportunity (<A HREF="DD02388.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02388.htm">see Threatening</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) do not count as a character-s attack for the round. It is possible for a
creature to get more attacks than normal if its opponent provides it with an
opening for an attack of opportunity.
<P></P>
Characters and monsters may choose a number of attack options, such as <I>grab, block, trap, </I>or <I>disarm</I>. The fighter might use his bill-hook to pull a mounted opponent off his
horse, or he might try to trip the animal. He could even go on the defensive and try
to block his enemy-s blow. Refer to Attack Options in <A HREF="DD02479.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02479.htm">Chapter Two</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> for more information about the various alternatives.
