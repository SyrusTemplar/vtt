This spell must be cast under a cloudy sky. The caster points at a cloud,
which immediately descends toward him. As it comes closer, the cloud changes shape,
becoming any sort of vessel imagined by the wizard (a dragon-shaped galley, a
one-man dinghy, etc.).
<P></P>
Although the airboat is made of cloud, it feels solid and can support the
weight of the caster plus one passenger per level of the wizard. It can fly at any
speed up to 5 miles per hour per level of the caster (to a maximum of 90 miles
per hour).
<P></P>
The caster maintains total telepathic control over the airboat's speed and
direction. While controlling the vessel, the wizard is able to perform other
actions but may not cast other spells.
