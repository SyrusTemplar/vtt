<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Painting:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character with this proficiency is skilled at rendering images with oil,
brush, and canvas. The artist can create reasonable portrayals of people,
landscapes, and monsters, and he possesses a knowledge of perspective, shading, and
composition. If this proficiency is coupled with the artistic talent trait, the
character receives +2 to his base painting score and can create stunningly
realistic works, capable of stirring profound reactions in observers-and perhaps
worth gold to wealthy NPCs.
