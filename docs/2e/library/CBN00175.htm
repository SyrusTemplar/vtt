<B>Physical Description:</B> Talib appears to be unusually strong and muscular for a man in his sixties.
His massive shoulders and arms are covered by tattoos, and his face is lined
with wrinkles and deep scars. One ear is gone, nothing more than a tattered strip
of skin, and his right eye is covered by a velvet eye patch. Because of his
scimitar, scars, and military demeanor, one might easily mistake him for a retired
general.
<P></P>
For dangerous missions, Talib adopts a <I>corpse host</I> as a disguise and a safeguard, since his distinctive features are easily
remembered and his lethal quarries often set up nasty surprises. He prefers to use
the fresh body of an experienced fighter who died of natural causes (or in
battle). Talib always makes sure to conceal any obvious mortal wounds on his host.
Most often, he does this simply by wearing enough clothing to cover himself
fairly well. After all, it wouldn?t do much for the credibility of his disguise to
be seen walking about with a gaping chest wound.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Background: </B>In his youth, Talib married Kazerabet (see her NPC sheet), who advanced his
training and let him rule by her side over a secluded kingdom of undead. After a
few happy decades, Kazerabet mysteriously deserted him. He has never forgiven
her, but neither has he stopped searching for her.
<P></P>
Talib became a Deathslayer after his two sisters, Jal? and Leyla, were
disintegrated by the lich Thalath. He has since destroyed four liches (including
Thalath) and returned all the zombies in his kingdom back to their graves. Ysawis is
now a secluded and deserted city in the jungle, doomed to slow decline by its
dark heritage. Talib lives in a magnificent Jade Palace in the decaying city,
alone save for a contingent of loyal jann. At least four jann bodyguards
accompany Talib (or his corpse host) on his adventures, flying invisibly around him.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Role-Playing Notes: </B>At first, Talib fought liches in revenge, but his anger has been replaced by
grim moral outrage. He is reckless, foolhardy, and fatalistic. He has no fear of
pain or death because his <I>corpse host</I> can easily be replaced, and he always has at least one <I>clone</I> of himself carefully stored in his palace. Destroying liches gives his empty
life a sense of purpose, and he pursues it with gusto. Though he suffers from
horrible recurring nightmares and terrifying visions, he somehow manages to
maintain a sane, positive, and often humorous outlook on life.
<P></P>
Talib (or his host) may sometimes join a party of adventurers to help mask his
movements when hunting a lich. To protect his companions, he tries to conceal
his true power and invisible associates unless direly threatened. Talib may
serve as a temporary ally for an adventure or two, provided these excursions help
Talib locate or ultimately destroy his enemy.
