<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wand of Magic Detection:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This wand is similar in operation to the <I>enemy detection</I> wand. If any form of magic is in operation, or a magical item exists within a
30-foot radius, the <I>magic detection</I> wand will pulse and point to the strongest source. Note that it will point to
a person upon whom a spell has been cast.
<P></P>
Operation requires one round, and successive rounds will point out
successively less powerful magical radiation. The school of magic (abjuration, alteration,
etc.) can be determined if one round is spent concentrating on the subject
emanation. One charge is expended per turn (or fraction thereof) of use. Starting
with the second round of continuous use, there is a 2% cumulative chance per
round that the wand will temporarily malfunction and indicate nonmagical items as
magical, or vice-versa. The wand may be recharged.
