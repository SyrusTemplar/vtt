<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Staff of Command:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This device has three functions, only two of which will be effective if the
wielder is a wizard; all three work when the staff is in a priest's hands. The
three functions are:
<P></P>
<I>Human influence:</I> This power duplicates that of the ring of the same name. Each <I>suggestion</I> or <I>charge</I> draws one charge from the staff.
<P></P>
<I>Mammal control/animal control:</I>This power functions only as <I> mammal control </I> (as the ring of that name) when the staff is used by a wizard. In the hands
of a priest it is a staff of <I> animal control </I> (as the potion of that name, all types of animals listed). Either use drains
one charge per turn or fraction thereof.
<P></P>
<I> Plant control:</I> This function duplicates that of the potion of the same name, but for each
10-square-foot ares of plants controlled for one turn or lass, one charge is
used. A wizard cannot control plants at all.
<P></P>
The staff can be recharged.
