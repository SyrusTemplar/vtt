</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> <I>The ruins of Ysawis were cloaked by the jungle when I rediscovered the broken
city walls with my first husband, Sumulael. That was in the early years of our
marriage, when my devotion to the Forbidden Arts ran strong with the careless
impetuousness of youth. We had been led to the city by disgruntled spirits, in
search of a legendary talisman. Even with our ghostly guides, the ruins of the
vine-choked city were extensive, and the exact location of our prize eluded us.
<P></P>
At first, when my husband and I beheld the bones of the city’s former
citizens, we amused ourselves by raising the moldering remains to attend us as ghastly
servants, skeletal porters, and shadowy messengers. When the quest for the
talisman yielded nothing immediately, we animated more of the city’s dead to expand
the search. Before long, our new slaves uncovered royal cemeteries where the
kings and queens of Ysawis had been buried for centuries before the city’s
disastrous end. I remember quite vividly my delight at this discovery. With a wave
of my hand, I cracked open the tombs’ monolithic stone doors, while Sumulael,
cackling with wicked glee, called forth the city’s ancient royalty, commanding
even the oldest of padishahs to stumble forth, wrapped in their worm-eaten
shrouds or burial robes, from the corrupted depths of the crypts and into our eternal
slavery. And while the dead gave up their age-corrupted treasures, none
carried my coveted talisman.
<P></P>
Thus Sumulael and I raised up the inhabitants of Ysawis from their crypts and
tombs to serve us. We lived there like exiled royalty for many years, until my
husband’s insanity and revolting habits grew intolerable. I ended up killing
the monster, eventually, with the help of adventurers who had discovered my
secluded city in the wilderness. That is how I met my second husband, Talib. He was
one of the explorers who assisted me in destroying Sumulael and helped me find
my long-sought talisman.
<P></P>
I soon came to love Talib, after a fashion. I taught him all of my hidden
secrets. We were happy together in Ysawis, rebuilding the city to its former glory.
But in the end, that marriage also failed, for I found that you cannot
practice the Art when you are happy, nor advance in its study if you are content. So I
left behind my beloved, to write this book in solitude and focus my mind on
the difficult road ahead. Come join me on this path of knowledge and
self-discovery. Let us explore the </I>Art of Necromancy<I> together.</I>

Death is the final arbiter. It claims everyone, regardless of class or
station, fame or notoriety, gentleness or depravity. In some cultures, death is
regarded as the threshold to an elevated spiritual existence or as the doorway
leading to another mortal life in a never-ending cycle of reincarnations. In other
societies, death is believed to be the ultimate ending of awareness, marking
complete annihilation and utter oblivion.
<P></P>
Since ancient times, scholars and priests have devoted their entire lives to
studying, explaining, and revering the final chapter in human life. For some
individuals, however, death has become an obsession, a source of magical power, or
even an object of religious adoration. These beings are necromancers, and they
are universally feared and loathed as the purveyors of unremitting evil.
<P></P>
According to popular myth, the necromancer practices vile and forbidden arts.
He is the macabre sorcerer who roots about in graveyards, searching out
moldering components for his obscene spells. She is the evil priestess who calls upon
restless, tormented spirits of the long-deceased, seeking their immortal
arcana. In their dark and secluded lairs, the mute undead, the monstrous familiar,
and the ravening fiend serve the necromancers in their ghoulish endeavors. In the
literature of fantasy and horror, the necromancer is usually portrayed as the
consummate villain.
<P></P>
Yet there is another side to the necromancer and the death priest. Consider
the compassionate ghost-hunter who lays tormented undead to rest, or the dutiful
priest of the Dead who helps guide spirits on their eternal voyage to the
netherworld. Necromancers can also have a constructive and positive role in the
campaign.
<P></P>
This book is devoted to exploring both aspects of necromancers and death
priests. We explore their varied roles as not only villains, but also as healers,
mentors, and patrons. These spellcasters are among the most complex, versatile,
and powerful characters available in the ADVANCED DUNGEON &amp; DRAGONS<FONT FACE="Times Roman">&#174;</FONT> game. This tome reveals all of their secrets and powers so that you—as the
Dungeon Master (DM)—can bring these master wizards and priests to life for the
players under your care.
