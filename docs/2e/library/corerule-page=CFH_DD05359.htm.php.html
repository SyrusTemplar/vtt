These rules for calculating damage to armor add a little complexity to combats
in the game. Every time a character is hit in combat, he'll have to add one
tally-mark to a separate scratch sheet of paper showing the damage his armor is
taking. It's easy to forget; the DM will constantly have to remind his players
to do this in the first weeks he is introducing this rule into his campaign.
Therefore, we recommend you use this system only if it's important to you. If it
isn't, don't bother with it.
