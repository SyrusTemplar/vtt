<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B>Nonproficient: </B>Any character who has not been trained in one of the four martial arts styles
automatically falls into this category. Nonproficient martial artists can make
normal pummeling attacks, but cannot claim any martial arts benefits.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Familiar: </B>Familiarity has no effect on the martial arts; a character is proficient in a
martial art or he is not.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Proficient: </B>Martial arts styles are unknown in most AD&amp;D game lands. To spend character
points (or a weapon proficiency) to become proficient in a martial arts style, a
character must be native to (or have paid an extended visit to) a culture where
martial arts has developed. Such cultures are usually nonwestern,
philosophical, and nonmaterialistic. They usually stress the power of nature or of the
inner self over the power of tools, weapons, and technology. Such cultures often do
not allow commoners to own weapons or armor.
<P></P>
Proficient nonwarriors can make one martial arts attack each round. Proficient
warriors gain their full allotment of melee attacks when making martial arts
attacks. If a character has sufficient character points (or proficiency slots)
available, he can become proficient in more than one martial arts style. All
benefits are cumulative; for example, a character proficient in styles A and B
could kick or punch creatures of any size, inflicting 1d3 points of damage with a
punch and 1d6 points of damage with a kick. If unarmored, the character could
make one extra punch each round with no penalties. Note that the four martial
arts styles do not constitute a weapon group; each much be learned separately.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Expert: </B>Any character who knows a martial arts style can spend character points (or
weapon proficiencies) to become expert in the style. (Characters proficient in
multiple martial arts styles can become experts in only one style.) Expert
warriors who are entitled to more than one melee attack each round can make the same
number of martial arts attacks each round, but gain no other benefits. Expert
nonwarriors can make multiple martial arts attacks at the same rate as a
nonspecialized warrior of the same level.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Specialized: </B>Generally, only single-classed fighters can become martial arts specialists,
though there are optional rules in the <A HREF="SP_DD03154.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="SP_DD03154.htm">Skills &amp; Powers</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> book that allow other characters to specialize. Martial arts specialists gain
the normal specialist attack and damage bonuses and extra attacks.
Specialists’ attack bonuses apply to their Strength scores when rolling for knockdowns.
Characters proficient in multiple martial arts styles can become specialists in
only one style. Martial arts specialists can make martial arts attacks against
armed opponents without provoking attacks of opportunity. Specialists can
attempt blocks and disarms against armed opponents without the –4 penalty to the
opposed roll; martial arts disarms against two-handed weapons receive a –4 penalty
instead of the normal –8 penalty for unarmed disarms.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Master: </B>Only single-classed fighters can attain mastery in martial arts. Martial arts
masters gain the normal master attack and damage bonuses and extra attacks.
Masters’ attack bonuses due to their Strength scores apply when rolling for
knockdowns, and apply to opponents as penalties to saving throw rolls vs. knockouts.
Grand master martial artists can use critical augmentation to score knockouts
on attack rolls of 16 or better.
<P></P>
A martial arts master threatens his front squares and is entitled to make
attacks of opportunity just as if he were armed with a weapon. A martial arts
master can choose to inflict normal damage instead of mostly temporary damage. If
the master rolls a critical hit while inflicting normal damage, he scores a
bludgeoning critical instead of a knockout chance. When determining severity,
compare the master’s size class with the target’s. Reduce the master’s size class by
one category if the attack is a punch.
