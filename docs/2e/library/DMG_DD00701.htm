<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The magical mixtures and compounds that make up potions are not always
compatible. The compatibility of potions is tested whenever two potions are actually
intermingled, or a potion is consumed by a creature while another such liquid,
already consumed, is in effect.
<P></P>
Permanent potions have an effective duration of one turn for mixing purposes.
If you drink another potion within one turn of drinking one with Permanent
duration, check on <A HREF="DD00702.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00702.htm">Table 111</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> . The exact effects of combining potions can't be calculated, because of
differences in formulae, fabrication methods, and component quality employed by
various mages. Therefore, it is suggested that <A HREF="DD00702.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00702.htm">Table 111</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> be used, with the following exceptions:
<P></P>
1. A <I>delusion</I> potion will mix with anything.
<P></P>
2. A <I>treasure finding</I> potion will always yield a lethal poison.
<P></P>
Secretly roll 1d100 for potion compatibility, giving no clues until necessary.
The effects of combining specific potions can be pre-set as a plot device, at
your option.
