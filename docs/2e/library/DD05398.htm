?? <B>Description:</B> A gentleman warrior, the Chevalier epitomizes honor, courage, and loyalty.
Modeled on the knights of the feudal age, the Chevalier serves his king (or other
ruler) as a soldier in the royal military of a powerful kingdom. While
primarily a fighting man, the Chevalier also performs ceremonial duties, household
chores, and any other functions necessary to promote the liege's interests and
secure the welfare of the state.
<P></P>
<B>?? Requirements:</B> In addition to the standard paladin qualifications, a Chevalier must meet at
least one of the following requirements:
<P></P>
? He must be the son of a Chevalier, nobleman, or aristocrat.
<P></P>
? He must be wealthy enough to &quot;buy'' his way into paladinhood by turning over
a valuable property or large treasure to his church or state.
<P></P>
? He must have an ability score of 15 or more in Strength, Constitution, or
Wisdom.
<P></P>
? <B>Ministration:</B> Government. In a theocracy, a Chevalier may take orders from the church.
<P></P>
<B>?? Role:</B> A Chevalier's training begins at childhood and continues throughout his
career. He acquires new duties and responsibilities as he rises through the ranks.
Typically, a Chevalier begins as an aide to a more experienced paladin,
undertakes missions for his liege as he grows in stature, and eventually aquires a
stronghold of his own.
<P></P>
?? Because Chevaliers of all ranks are considered part of the aristocracy, they
command the respect afforded other members of the noble class. Tradition demands
that Chevaliers remain apart from society; consequently, Chevaliers seldom
socialize with anyone other than paladins. Fully aware of their privileged status,
Chevaliers carry themselves with pride. They maintain an immaculate
appearance, are unfailingly courteous, and behave with dignity in all situations.
<P></P>
?? A Chevalier of any level may join an adventuring party, assuming the party's
goals agree with those of the state. The Chevalier's companions will find him
the consummate professional. As a friend, however, he may leave much to be
desired; a Chevalier often impresses others as vain and pretentious. More comfortable
with taking orders than giving them, a Chevalier rarely volunteers for
leadership roles, though he dutifully assumes command if asked or assigned.
<P></P>
?? <B>Symbol: </B>The Chevalier employs the same symbol as his liege, often a crown, an animal
associated with royalty (such as a lion or eagle), or a military emblem (crossed
lances or a fist clutching a sword).
<P></P>
?? <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Armorer, Groom, Weaponsmith.
<P></P>
?? <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Required:</I> Sword (any) and lance (any). <I>Recommended:</I> Dagger, battle axe, horseman's flail, horseman's mace, horseman's pick, war
hammer.
<P></P>
?? <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Recommended:</I> Armorer, Blind-fighting, Bureaucracy*, Etiquette, Heraldry, Jousting*,
Languages (Ancient or Modern), Law*, Local History, Oratory*, Weaponsmithing.
<P></P>
?? <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Usually, a Chevalier must buy his own equipment. At a minimum, he must
purchase a mount (at least a riding horse, until he acquires a bonded mount), sword,
lance, and armor (no less than chain mail). On occasion, a liege supplies this
equipment for free; in such cases, the liege often charges a monthly
maintenance fee (1-4 gp).
<P></P>
<B>?? Bonded Mount:</B> Any war horse. Airborne mounts are possible but uncommon.
<P></P>
<B>?? Special Benefits:</B>
<P></P>
?? <I>Chain of Command:</I> Chevaliers adhere to rigid chains of command. Any high-level Chevalier can
give commands to lower-level Chevaliers from the same kingdom. The lower-level
Chevaliers must follow these orders as if they were given by the liege. Typical
commands include loaning weapons and mounts, delivering messages, and securing
supplies.
<P></P>
?? <I>Sanctuary:</I> A Chevalier may request sanctuary in any stronghold in his kingdom, or in any
lawful good kingdom with diplomatic or political ties to the Chevalier's
kingdom. By custom, the owner of the stronghold must provide the Chevalier with
shelter, food, and water for up to three days; the offer extends to a number of
companions equal to the Chevalier's level (a 4th-level Chevalier may request
sanctuary for himself and four others).
<P></P>
?? <B>Special Hindrances:</B>
<P></P>
?? <I>Chain of Command:</I> The chain of command works both ways. A low-level Chevalier must execute all
of the commands of a higher-level Chevalier, as described in the Special
Benefits section.
<P></P>
?? <I>Extra Responsibilities:</I> As part of a complex bureaucracy, the Chevalier has more responsibilities
than most other paladins. He must attend state functions, participate in royal
festivals, and represent his liege at tournaments. He may be required to train
young warriors, file monthly reports of his activities, and officiate at dubbing
ceremonies for new Chevaliers. In general, the larger the kingdom, the more
demands on the Chevalier.
<P></P>
<I>?? State Enemies:</I> A liege makes many enemies over the course of his career. By definition,
enemies of the liege are also enemies of his Chevaliers. A Chevalier may be subject
to kidnapping and assassination attempts by foes he's never met, who attack
the Chevalier to avenge themselves against the liege.

<P></P>
<P></P>
?? Here is a typical career path for the Chevalier. The ranks are for game
purposes only and don't necessary correspond to any historical definitions.
<P></P>
<I>?? Page.</I> At 0 level, a Chevalier candidate becomes a servant on his liege's staff. He
lives in the liege's stronghold or the stronghold of a military officer or
noble. The page learns academic fundamentals (including history, etiquette, and
religion), along with basic hunting and riding skills.
<P></P>
<I>?? Valet.</I> At 1st level, the page becomes a valet, assigned as an apprentice to a
high-ranking paladin (usually, a Chevalier of at least 5th level). The valet acts as
personal aide both on the battlefield and at home. He studies combat
techniques, advanced riding skills, and theology. Should he decide to permanently assume
the role of an aide, he becomes a Squire (see the <A HREF="DD05409.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD05409.htm">Squire kit</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> for details).
<P></P>
<I>?? Stronghold Knight.</I> Also known as a household knight, the valet assumes this position at 2nd
level. He works primarily in his liege's stronghold, performing guard duty,
custodial chores, and occasional staff supervision. He may go to war or undertake
quests and missions on his liege's behalf.
<P></P>
?? <I>Protector. </I>A Chevalier reaches this rank at 3rd level, when he gains the power to turn
undead. The protector may be sent into the field more frequently, though he still
lives in his liege's stronghold and his superiors still closely monitor his
actions.
<P></P>
<I>?? Warder.</I> At 4th level, the Chevalier becomes a warder. His liege becomes increasingly
comfortable sending him on missions to distant lands. Supervision continues to
decrease.
<P></P>
<I>?? Guardian.</I> At 5th level, the Chevalier becomes a guardian, experienced enough to
supervise a valet.
<P></P>
?? <I>Grand Knight.</I> A Chevalier attains this rank at 6th level and may represent his liege on
diplomatic missions. While still technically a member of the liege's stronghold, a
grand knight is routinely granted permission to leave the stronghold for long
periods of time.
<P></P>
<I>?? Bachelor.</I> To qualify for this rank, the Chevalier must have reached 7th level <I>and</I> have acquired a plot of land large enough for a stronghold. At this rank, the
Chevalier becomes eligible to maintain a small home outside his liege's
stronghold. Usually, a Chevalier must be at bachelor level to receive permission to
marry.
<P></P>
<I>?? Banneret.</I> The Chevalier must be at least 9th level <I>and</I> must have established his own stronghold. The stronghold serves as the
banneret's home base. He may maintain a small staff of his own by this point.
<P></P>
<I>?? Lord.</I> This is a royal title awarded by the liege to a Chevalier of at least 10th
level who has successfully maintained a stronghold for a long period (typically,
5-10 years). In most cases, the stronghold must be profitable (thus benefiting
his liege through taxes or levies), have withstood at least one enemy assault
(to demonstrate the Chevalier's leadership skills), and employ at least 10 staff
members and soldiers (to demonstrate the Chevalier's management skills).
