<I> Body clock</I> affects a subject in the following ways.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">•</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The subject's need for sleep is reduced. For every hour that a subject
sleeps, he is as refreshed as if he slept 10 hours. For every two hours that a
subject sleeps during the spell (20 hours of rest), he regains hit points as if he
spent a day of complete rest. However, wizards are not able to memorize spells;
&quot;real&quot; time must pass for this to occur.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">•</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The subject's need to breathe is reduced. He breathes only 10% as often as
normal for the duration of the spell, enabling him to hold his breath 10 times
longer than normal and use less air in enclosed situations.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">•</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The subject can set an internal &quot;alarm clock&quot; to alert him when a specific
amount of time has passed. The subject then hears a brief ringing in his ears,
audible only to him. The ringing is loud enough to wake the subject. He can set
as many internal alarm clocks as he wishes, as long as they all occur within the
duration of the spell.
<P></P>
The spell has no effect on movement, spellcasting, or any other normal
activities.
<P></P>
The material components are a kernel of corn, a drop of water, and a stoppered
glass bottle.
