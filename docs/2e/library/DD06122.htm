Before allowing players to choose kits for their characters, the DM should
look at each kit and consider several factors.
<P></P>
<I>Is this kit appropriate to the campaign?</I> Not all kits make sense for every campaign. If it is established that Amazons
do not exist in the DM's campaign world, he should not allow players to choose
the Amazon kit. The DM should tell the players which kits he will allow and
which are forbidden before they create their characters.
<P></P>
<I>Do the players need more information about a kit?</I> The DM might want to furnish the players with additional background
information about a particular kit. For instance, he might tell them that in his world,
the Savage Wizards all live on the jungle peninsula of Blackroot and have had
little-- if any-- contact with other civilizations.
<P></P>
<I>Are there any changes in the kit? </I>The DM is free to make changes in the proficiencies, hindrances, and any other
components of the kits to make them compatible with his campaign world. The
players should be informed of any such changes before they choose kits for their
characters.
