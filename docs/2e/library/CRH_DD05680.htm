   If you're a casual player, or have only a passing interest in the ranger
character, begin by looking over the table of contents and noting any topics that
catch your eye. Read the most appealing sections, skim over the rest, and consult
with your DM about any new ideas you'd like to try. Later, you can read the
entire book at your leisure, or keep it on the shelf as a reference, along with
the previous handbooks in this series (including <I>The Complete Fighter's Handbook, The Complete Priest's Handbook, The Complete
Wizard's Handbook, The Complete Thief's Handbook, The Complete Psionics Handbook</I>, and<I> The Complete Bard's Handbook</I>).

   Players who take their rangers seriously are advised to read the entire book.
You'll discover a host of new ideas and character options, expanded tables, and
tips for fine-tuning your role-playing techniques. As mentioned, all of the
rules in this book must be cleared with the DM before you can use them in a game.

   Players of all persuasions should take a look at the new ranger character
sheets located in the back of the book. The sheets have been custom-designed to
record virtually every detail about a ranger character, and also feature a number
of helpful notes to minimize the amount of time spent referring to the
rulebooks. And speaking of the rulebooks, we've also compiled all of the key rules from
the <I>DUNGEON MASTER Guide</I> and Player's Handbook relevant to rangers; you'll find most of them in the
first three chapters. We've also made every effort to elaborate on the most
interesting concepts from the <I>DMG</I> and <I>PH</I>.
