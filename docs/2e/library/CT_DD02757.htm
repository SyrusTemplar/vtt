Bombards, catapults, and trebuchets fire their projectiles in a high arch;
they are inaccurate and cannot really be aimed at anything; the crew simply points
the engine in the target?s general direction and hopes the missile will land
somewhere nearby.
<P></P>
All targets are considered Armor Class 0, but there is no range modifier. The
attack roll is modified as follows:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> +3 for stationary targets;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> ?3 for targets moving at a rate greater than 3 but less than 12;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> ?6 for targets moving at a rate of 12 or greater;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> +4 for the second and subsequent shots at a stationary target;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> +2 for targets whose largest dimension is greater than 30';
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> +4 for targets whose largest dimension is greater than 90';
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> +6 for targets whose largest dimension is greater than 270'.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Cover generally is not a factor when resolving indirect fire, but concealment
can be. Indirect fire generally can arch over obstacles between it and the
target, provided that the obstacle is no higher than 150% of the distance between
the obstacle and the engine, or the obstacle and the target, whichever is less.
For example, a wall 90' feet high would not block indirect fire unless it was
within 60' of either the engine or the target. Note that in many cases it is
easier for an engine to fire at a feature or structure where opponents are hiding
than it is to fire at the opponents themselves.
<P></P>
If a creature is too small to be targeted individually, an indirect fire
engine still can fire at the 15' square area containing the creature. The base
modifier is 0 (because the target is not <I>larger </I>than 30' long). Modifiers for the small target?s movement apply (it?s hard to
hit the right area when the creatures within it are moving). The attacker must
select an intended impact square for the missile; any of the nine squares in
the area can be selected.
<P></P>
<B>Hits: </B>An engine?s missile tends to bounce or shatter on impact and affects an area,
as shown on the accompanying diagrams. Creatures within the area of effect
suffer damage listed for the weapon. Creatures with 5+1 or more Hit Dice can roll a
successful saving throw vs. petrification to avoid the damage; modifiers for
Dexterity and magical protections apply. A creature that has suffered a direct
hit (by being in the impact square or by being large enough to qualify as a
target and getting hit) is allowed no saving throw even if normally eligible for
one. Creatures with hard cover between them and the impact square get a saving
throw even if not normally entitled to one. Creatures under cover get bonuses to
their saving throws; see <A HREF="DD02453.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02453.htm">Chapter One</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
If the engine is firing at an area containing creatures too small to target
individually, the shot never lands exactly where intended. Follow the procedure
outlined below for misses, but roll 1d4 for distance.
<P></P>
<B>Misses: </B>To determine where the shot actually falls, roll 1d8 on the <A HREF="DMG_DD00446.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00446.htm">indirect fire scatter diagram</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> to determine the direction of the miss; then roll 2d6 to determine the
distance in squares from the intended impact square and the actual impact square. It
is possible for the shot to fall inside the engine?s minimum range or outside
its maximum range. Creatures in the area where the shot falls suffer the effects
of a hit.
<P></P>
<B>Hits and Misses Against Large Creatures: </B>If the missile scores a direct hit on a creature large enough to qualify as a
target, there is no effect on creatures in the adjacent squares. The creature?s
body prevents the missile from bouncing or shattering. If a direct attack on a
large creature misses, the attacker rolls for scatter. The intended impact
square is always the square the creature occupies. If the creature occupies more
than one square, the intended impact square is always the square closest to the
engine.
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits and Knockdowns: </B>Only direct hits can be critical hits or cause knockdowns. If the rules from <A HREF="DD02710.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02710.htm">Chapter Six</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> are in play, indirect fire engines inflict Large bludgeoning criticals.
<P></P>
<A NAME="961cf4f1"></A><B>Flaming Projectiles: </B>Catapults and trebuchets can be loaded with missiles soaked in pitch or a
similar flammable substance. The missile?s range is reduced by 1/3. When it
strikes, the missile scatters flaming debris over its normal area of effect. The
debris burns for two rounds, inflicting 2d6 points of damage the first round and 1d6
points of damage the second round. The effect on wooden structures is the same
as flaming oil. A catapult also can hurl canisters of Greek fire. A Greek fire
cannister also reduces the catapult?s range by 1/3. The cannister breaks on
impact and scatters Greek fire over the catapult?s normal area of effect.
