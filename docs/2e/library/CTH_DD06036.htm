Antidotes can be manufactured for most poisons. To use an antidote you must
match it with its poison (see the assassin kit), or just administer an antidote
and hope that by chance it is the right one. (The DM may permit the existence of
some antidotes that counter more than one poison, e.g., both types A and B
injected.) An antidote will take effect if administered immediately or at least
before the toxin's onset time. It then either negates the poison entirely (if the
poisoned character made his saving throw in the first place) or reduces its
effect to saving throw level.
