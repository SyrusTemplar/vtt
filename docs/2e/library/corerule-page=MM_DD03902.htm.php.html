Ettins, or two-headed giants, as they are often called, are vicious and
unpredictable hunters that stalk by night and eat any meat they can catch.
<P></P>
An ettin at first appears to be a stone or hill giant with two heads. On
closer inspection, however, the creature's vast differences from the relatively
civilized giant races become readily apparent. An ettin has pink to brownish skin,
though it appears to be covered in a dark brown hide. This is because an ettin
never bathes if it can help it, and is therefore usually encrusted with a thick
layer of dirt and grime. Its skin is thick, giving the ettin its low Armor
Class. An ettin's hair is long, stringy, and unkempt; its teeth are large,
yellowing, and often rotten. The ettin's facial features strongly resemble those of an
orc -- large watery eyes, turned-up piggish snout, and large mouth.
<P></P>
An ettin's right head is always the dominant one, and the right arm and leg
will likely appear slightly more muscular and well-developed than the left. An
ettin wears only rough, untreated skins, which are dirty and unwashed. Obviously,
ettins smell very bad, due to their complete lack of grooming habits -- good
or bad.
<P></P>
Ettins do not have a true language of their own. Instead, they speak a
mish-mash of orc, goblin, giant dialects, and the alignment tongue of chaotic evil
creatures. Any adventurer who speaks orcish can understand 50% of what an ettin
says.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Having two heads is definitely an advantage for the ettins, as one is always
alert, watching for danger and potential food. This means that an ettin is
surprised only on the roll of a 1 on 1d10. An ettin also has infravision up to 90
feet, which enables it to hunt and fight effectively in the dark.
<P></P>
Though ettins have a low intelligence, they are cunning fighters. They prefer
to ambush their victims rather than charge into a straight fight, but once the
battle has started, ettins usually fight furiously until all enemies are dead,
or the battle turns against them. Ettins do not retreat easily, only doing so
if victory is impossible.
<P></P>
In combat, an ettin has two attacks. Because each of its two heads controls an
arm, an ettin does not suffer an attack roll penalty for attacking with both
arms. An ettin always attacks with two large clubs, often covered with spikes.
Using these weapons, the ettin causes 2d8 points of damage with its left arm,
and 3d6 points of damage with its right. If the ettin is disarmed or unable to
use a weapon, it attacks empty-handed, inflicting 1d10 points of damage with its
left fist and 2d6 points with its right.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Ettins like to establish their lairs in remote, rocky areas. They dwell in
dark, underground caves that stink of decaying food and offal. Ettins are
generally solitary, and mated pairs only stay together for a few months after a young
ettin is born to them. Young ettins mature very quickly, and within eight to ten
months after they are born, they are self-sufficient enough to go off on their
own.
<P></P>
On rare occasions, however, a particularly strong ettin may gather a small
group of 1d4 ettins together. This small band of ettins stays together only as
long as the leader remains alive and undefeated in battle. Any major defeat
shatters the leader's hold over the band, and they each go their separate ways.
<P></P>
Ettins collect treasure only because it can buy them the services of goblins
or orcs. These creatures sometimes serve ettins by building traps around their
lairs, or helping to fight off a powerful opponent. Ettins have also been known
to occasionally keep 1-2 <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03805.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03805.htm.php.html">cave bears</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> in the area of their lairs.
<P></P>
The sloppy caves of ettins are a haven for parasites and vermin, and it isn't
unusual for the ettins themselves to be infected with various parasitic
diseases. Adventurers rummaging through ettin lairs for valuables will find the task
disgusting, if not dangerous.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Because ettin society is so primitive, they produce little of any value to
civilized creatures. Ettins tolerate the presence of other creatures, like orcs,
in the area of their lair if they can be useful in some way. Otherwise, ettins
tend to be violently isolationist, crushing trespassers without question.
