Weapon proficiencies can also be used to acquire a variety of special perks,
traits, and characteristics useful for a fighter. Some of these talents were
originally presented as nonweapon proficiencies and are noted with an asterisk;
they can be purchased with either type of proficiency slot.

As always, the DM is the final arbiter of whether or not a particular option
or ability is permitted in his campaign. If he decides that an ability doesn-t
fit, he can require the players to choose another talent.
