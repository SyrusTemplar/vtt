The Advanced Thief Types options are designed to add depth to a thief
character. But if the character is already multi-classed (as are many demi-humans;
e.g., a halfling fighter/thief), he doesn't really need any more depth. Therefore
only single-class thieves can take one of the Thief Kits described above.
<P></P>
However, with the flexibility available to thieves in the 2nd edition AD&amp;D?
game, especially with nonweapon proficiency rules, you can very closely simulate
a kit by carefully choosing proficiencies and allotting points among thief
skills. The character won't get the special benefits of the kit (e.g., the bonus
nonweapon proficiencies), but to outward appearances, the character will be that
type of thief.
<P></P>
For instance, suppose a halfling fighter/thief wishes to be a fence. If the
Secondary Skills system is being used, he should take one of those listed in the
fence kit-Trader/Barterer, let's say.
<P></P>
As a first level thief, he receives 4 nonweapon proficiencies (if they are
used) and selects them from the required and recommended proficiencies of the kit.
The required ones are Appraising and Information Gathering. Note that these
proficiencies are NOT bonuses, because the halfling is not actually taking the
kit. His other two slots should be filled from the recommended list; fast-talking
and observation proficiencies, perhaps.
<P></P>
If you do all this, and have your DM's permission, within the context of your
campaign this halfling will be considered a fence. That is, he fills the role
of a fence in the campaign world, and is regarded as such by other figures of
the underworld. Only you and the DM know that he doesn't have all the benefits of
a true fence.
