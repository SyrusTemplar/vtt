By means of this spell, the wizard creates a glowing, rainbow-hued band of
interweaving patterns. Any creature caught in it may become fascinated and gaze at
it as long as the effect lasts. The spell can captivate a maximum of 24
levels, or Hit Dice, of creatures--24 creatures with 1 Hit Die each, 12 with 2 Hit
Dice, etc. All creatures affected must be within the area of effect, and each is
entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. An attack on an affected creature that
causes damage frees it from the spell immediately. Creatures that are restrained
and removed from the area still try to follow the pattern.
<P></P>
Once the rainbow pattern is cast, the wizard need only gesture in the
direction he desires, and the pattern of colors moves slowly off in that direction, at
the rate of 30 feet per round. It persists without further attention from the
spellcaster for 1d3 rounds. All affected creatures follow the moving rainbow of
light. If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area (through flame,
off a cliff, etc.), allow a second saving throw. If the view of the lights is
completely blocked (by an <I>obscurement</I> spell, for instance), the spell is negated.
<P></P>
The wizard need not utter a sound, but he must gesture appropriately while
holding a crystal prism and the material component, a piece of phosphor.
