With this spell, the priest creates tones and harmonies of such unearthly
beauty and complexity that they entrance the listener, making it difficult for the
listener to attack or otherwise harm the priest. The listener receives a normal
saving throw against this effect. Failure means that the listener is entranced
and is unable to attack the priest for the duration of the spell.
<P></P>
In addition, the music makes the subject gullible and more susceptible to
charm magics such as <I>charm person, suggestion</I>, and <I>hypnotism</I>. While the music spell is in effect, the subject saves against charm spells
with a -3 penalty.
<P></P>
This spell does not protect other characters in company with the priest;
listeners who have fallen prey to the music are free to attack anyone else. The
spell effect ends instantly if the priest takes any hostile action against a
creature under the influence of the spell.
<P></P>
<I>Music of the spheres</I> can affect one creature per three levels of the priest (one subject at 3rd
level, two at 6th level, etc.). Subjects must be within a 20-foot-diameter circle.
<P></P>
Potential victims must have Intelligence of at least 1 (necessary to
understand the concept of music) and must be able to hear the music (i.e., they cannot
be deaf and there can be nothing obstructing the victim's ears). This also means
that the level of background noise must be low enough for the music to be
audible. The DM should assume that the music is the same volume as an average
human's normal speaking voice. If the potential subject could not hear speech at the
appropriate range under prevailing conditions, the spell cannot affect that
subject. The spell would be virtually useless in the midst of a full-scale battle
or during a hurricane.
<P></P>
The material component comprises a set of three small bows made from fine
silver, each costing 100 gp. The lengths of the bows must be in the ratio of 1 to 4
to 9. The priest strokes these bows together in an intricate sequence while
casting the spell. The bows are not consumed in the casting.
