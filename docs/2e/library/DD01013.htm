<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Pearl of Wisdom:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Although it appears to be a normal pearl, a <I>pearl of wisdom</I> causes a priest to increase one point in Wisdom if he retains the pearl for
one month. The increase happens at the end of 30 days, but thereafter the priest
must keep the pearl with him or the one point gain will be lost.
<P></P>
Note that one in 20 of these magical pearls is cursed to work in reverse, but
once the point of Wisdom is lost, the pearl turns to powder; the loss is
permanent barring some magical restoration means such as a <I>wish</I> or <I>tome of understanding.</I>
