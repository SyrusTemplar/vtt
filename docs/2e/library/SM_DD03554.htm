</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Wizards and priests are constantly devising new and interesting applications
for their magical powers. It seems to be a part of the job description; most
player characters dive into research and item enchantment as soon as they reach
the required level and set aside enough money for an appropriate laboratory or
altar.
<P></P>
At first glance, these activities may seem like they?re not worth the time and
the trouble. After all, researching a new spell or creating a new magical item
can be a lengthy and expensive undertaking, uncertain of success. In fact,
many DMs will require a PC wizard or priest to embark on several adventures?some
quite hazardous?in order to obtain the knowledge or materials necessary. More
than one character has allowed his ambition to lead him into expensive or fatal
mistakes.
<P></P>
While research and item creation are difficult and tedious endeavors, they can
also be extremely rewarding. First of all, player characters confronted with a
specific problem may be able to devise a spell or item that can respond to
that problem perfectly. Secondly, new items or spells have the advantage of
surprise; everyone knows what a <I>fireball</I> is and how it works, but <I>Felgar?s incandescent strike </I>is another matter entirely! New spells or items can provide player characters
with defenses or capabilities never before seen in a campaign.

Spell research and magical item creation are discussed together in this
chapter because they represent one of the most rewarding and interesting aspects of
the AD&amp;D game the ability of a character to create something that will outlast
his or her own career (or even lifetime, in some cases!), becoming a permanent
part of the DM?s campaign world. After all, spells and items with names attached
to them were first created by adventuring wizards and priests no different
from any other player character. What wizard doesn?t dream of being known as the
next Rary, Bigby, or Otiluke?
