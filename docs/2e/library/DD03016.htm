<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Using Disadvantages</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Disadvantages work well to enhance the role-playing of a character, and as
such they should be the player's responsibility to remember and employ. A
character with an irritating personality, for example, can be role-played in such a
way that the DM never has to do anything to enforce the disadvantage. Good
role-players will create their own trouble, so to speak.
<P></P>
However, some aspects of disadvantages require DM input. Somewhere amid
copious volumes of notes, the DM should keep a list of each character-s
disadvantages, making sure than none of them are overlooked. For example, if a character has
a phobia of spiders, the DM can insure there will be a chance every once in
awhile to encounter some big, hairy-legged arachnids.
<P></P>
If a disadvantage falls to the player's responsibility, and that player tends
to ignore it, the DM should create a few situations where the disadvantage is
impossible to overlook. For example, if the player does not role-play the
character's irritating personality disadvantage, NPCs might suddenly become enraged
at the character for imagined slights-insults that the NPCs claim result from
the PC's irritating personality.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character with a moderate disadvantage checks against ability or sub-ability
scores, while a character with a severe disadvantage rolls at half of the
ability scores, rounded up.
<P></P>
For example, a character with a Wisdom/Willpower score of 17 would need to
roll a 9 or less to resist the effects of a severe disadvantage, whereas a roll of
17 or lower would resist the effects of a moderate disadvantage.

<P></P>
If the DM is agreeable, a player can remove a character's disadvantage by
spending character points. Disadvantages rated as moderate can be eliminated, while
severe disadvantages can be reduced to moderate at one level advancement for a
character, and then removed at a subsequent advancement.
<P></P>
The cost to remove a disadvantage is 1 character point more than the points
gained when the disadvantage is first acquired. For example, the colorblind
disadvantage gains 3 character points. Removing this disadvantage costs 4 points.
<P></P>
A severe disadvantage is reduced to a moderate disadvantage for 1 more
character point than the difference between the severe and moderate costs. For
example, severe allergies award 8 character points, moderate allergies 3-a difference
of 5 points. Thus, the cost to reduce severe allergies to moderate is 6
character points.
