Optional Abilities</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
A customized wizard is built from a slate of optional abilities, ranging from
schools he may cast spells from to game mechanics such as THAC0 improvement
rate, Hit Die size, and weapons and armor allowed. The available abilities are
listed below.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Delayed Acquisition of Abilities: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A character can reduce the cost of a special ability by choosing to delay it
to a higher level. For example, a character may select the ability of reduced
casting time, but then delay the acquisition of the ability to 4th or 5th level.
An ability that is not acquired until 3rd level is 1 point cheaper than the
listed cost; an ability delayed to 5th level is 2 points cheaper; an ability
delayed to 7th level is 3 points cheaper; an ability delayed to 9th level is 4
points cheaper than listed; and an ability delayed to 11th level is 5 points cheaper
than normal. No ability can be reduced to zero or less points—everything costs
at least one character point, no matter how long the wizard waits for the
power.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Access to schools (5+): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A customized wizard pays 5 character points (CPs) for each school he may learn
and cast spells from. A standard mage would pay 40 CPs to gain access to the
eight schools of philosophy: abjuration, alteration, conjuration/summoning,
divination, enchantment/charm, illusion, invocation/evocation, and necromancy.
Customized wizards may choose to have access to thaumaturgical schools or schools
of effect if they wish.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Armor (5/10/15): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">With this ability, a wizard may ignore the normal restriction against using
armor. As a 5-point ability, the wizard may wear padded armor; for 10 points, the
wizard may wear leather, studded leather, hide, or brigandine armor; and for
15 points, the wizard may wear any armor he chooses. Note that a wizard may not
use any kind of shield.
<P></P>
<A NAME="2aea93b3"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Automatic spell acquisition (2/5): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The wizard may add a new spell of his choice to his spell book every time he
gains a level, without having to pass a learn spells check. The wizard need not
have a copy of the spell but must have seen the spell used at least once. As a
2-point ability, the wizard can acquire spells from one school only; as a
5-point ability, he can choose from any school he has access to. The wizard must be
able to cast the spell he chooses.
<P></P>
<A NAME="320f6528"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Bonus spells (10/15): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A wizard with this ability increases the number of spells of each level that
he can memorize by one. For example, a 1st-level wizard may memorize two
1st-level spells instead of just one. For 10 points, the wizard may select spells of
one school as bonus spells; for 15 points, the bonus spell can be any spell the
wizard can cast.
<P></P>
<A NAME="8c4541de"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Casting time reduction (2/5): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Spells cast by the wizard are unusually swift and have a casting time of 1
less than normal. For 2 points, the wizard may accelerate spells of only one
school. For 5 points, all spells are faster.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Combat bonus (8/10): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A wizard with this class ability is much better in combat than normal. For
eight CPs, the wizard’s THAC0 advances as if he were a rogue of equal level. For
10 CPs, the wizard’s THAC0 advances as a priest’s.
<P></P>
<A NAME="7f9a967d"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Constitution adjustment (5): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The wizard may use the Constitution-based hit point bonus of warriors, gaining
+3 or +4 hp per Hit Die with a Constitution of 17 or 18 instead of the normal
maximum of +2 hp per die.
<P></P>
<A NAME="516a5e1b"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Detect magic (10): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A wizard with this power may use detect magic once per day per two levels
(twice a day at 3rd level, three times at 5th, and so on). The wizard doesn’t need
to memorize the spell, but in all other respects the power operates as if it
were actually cast by the wizard.
<P></P>
<A NAME="bf7b702c"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Dispel (10/15): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This power allows a wizard to dispel one kind of effect or spell once per day,
or three times per day for 15 CPs. The range of this power is 30 yards, and it
requires nothing more than one round of concentration. The base chance of
success is 50%, ±5% for each level difference between the dispeller and the creator
of the effect to be dispelled. The type of effect that may be dispelled must
be a group of linked spells in the same school; for example, <I>charm </I>spells, <I>polymorph </I>spells, or <I>shadow magic </I>and <I>monsters </I>are all good examples.
<P></P>
<A NAME="15a5436f"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Enhanced casting level (10): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A wizard with this ability may cast spells of one school as if he were 1d4
levels higher than his actual level (roll each time used). All level-based effects
of the spell are altered, including damage, range, duration, and area of
effect. This power may only be invoked once per day.
<P></P>
<A NAME="3b861d50"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Extended spell duration (10/15): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Noninstantaneous spells cast by the wizard last an additional time unit
(round, hour, day, etc.) per two levels. The exact time unit depends on the normal
duration of the spell—if the duration is noted in hours, a 5th-level wizard’s
bonus would be an extra three hours. As a 10-point power, extended duration
applies to spells of one school. For 15 points, it applies to all spells cast by the
wizard.
<P></P>
<A NAME="ef35dd81"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Followers (10): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Normally, wizards do not attract loyal followers at high levels like other
characters do. A wizard who selects this ability automatically attracts 20 to 200
0-level men-at-arms at 8th level if he establishes a castle, keep, tower, or
other place of strength. In addition, 1d6 low-level wizards (1st to 3rd level)
will also appear and request permission to study beneath the PC wizard. These
loyal apprentices can undertake minor errands or research on the wizard’s behalf,
as long as they are treated well.
<P></P>
<A NAME="c2afb716"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Immunity (10+): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A wizard with this power gains complete immunity to one particular spell, at a
cost of 10 CPs plus 1 CP per spell level. The wizard ignores the effects of
the spell and cannot be directly damaged or harmed by the spell, although he
could be <I>indirectly </I>harmed—a wizard immune to <I>charm person </I>could be beaten senseless by a charmed fighter, for example. The character may
gain immunity to a group of related spells by spending CPs to become immune to
the highest-level spell in that group, so a wizard who wanted immunity to all
charms would spend 18 CPs for immunity to <I>mass charm—charm person </I>and <I>charm monster </I>are included with immunity to <I>mass charm</I>. The DM may disallow any immunity that he feels is too powerful.
<P></P>
<A NAME="d1415de4"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Improved Hit Die (10/20): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">For 10 character points, the wizard uses a d6 for a Hit Die instead of a d4.
For 20 points, the wizard uses a d8.
<P></P>
<A NAME="4b4ca3ea"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Learning bonus (5/7+): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The wizard gains a +15% bonus to his chance to learn spells of one school; for
seven points, this increases to +25%. The wizard may apply the bonus to
learning spells of all schools by doubling the point cost.
<P></P>
<A NAME="36c6e991"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>No components (5/8): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">With this talent, a wizard may designate one spell of each level as a spell
that requires no material components. For 5 points, the wizard may select spells
of one school only; for 8 points, the wizard may select spells from any school.
The wizard may not choose spells from the schools of alchemy or artifice for
this advantage.
<P></P>
<A NAME="99fbdc51"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Persistent spell effect (15 +2/spell level): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The wizard may select one spell that he knows (and can cast) to have a
persistent, permanent effect. He must give up one spell slot of the appropriate level,
so a wizard who wants to have <I>ESP </I>as a persistent power must leave one 2nd-level spell slot empty. Only spells
with noninstantaneous, nonspecial durations may be selected as persistent
powers, and the spell must be one which affects the caster. By concentrating, the
wizard may invoke the power and maintain it for as long as he continues to
concentrate. Changing the persistent spell requires a full week of uninterrupted work.
If the wizard is struck by a <I>dispel magic</I>, the persistent effect fails. First-level spells that are appropriate for
persistent effects include: <I>change self, chill touch, detect undead, feather fall, gaze reflection, jump,
protection from evil, shield, spider climb, </I>and <I>ventriloquism</I>.
<P></P>
<A NAME="cccd8032"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Priestly wizard (10+):</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> A wizard with this talent may select one minor sphere of access for 10 points
or one major sphere for 15 points. The wizard must still use wizard spell
slots to memorize these spells; in effect, they’re translations or adaptations of
priest spells the wizard knows through special training. Priest spells must be
learned normally and count against the wizard’s maximum number of spells per
level.
<P></P>
<A NAME="471aade5"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Proficiency group crossovers (5+): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Normally, a wizard may select proficiencies from the wizard and general
groups, and must pay a penalty in character points or proficiency slots for choosing
proficiencies out of these groups. At a cost of 5 CPs each, the wizard may
select another character group for a NWP crossover.
<P></P>
<A NAME="870352d8"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Range increase (5/7+): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">All ranged spells from one school known to the wizard have their range
increased by 25% for 5 CPs or 50% for 7 CPs. For example, the 1st-level spell <I>hold person</I> has a range of 20 yards per level, but with this power the range could
increase to 25 or 30 yards per level. The wizard can gain this bonus to all ranged
spells regardless of school by doubling the CP cost.
<P></P>
<A NAME="0796312a"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Read magic (5): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This power allows the wizard to use <I>read magic </I>once per day per two levels. The wizard doesn’t need to memorize the spell,
but in all other respects the power operates as if it were a read magic actually
cast by the wizard.
<P></P>
<A NAME="40c42de1"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Research bonus (5+): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When the wizard is performing spell research, spells of one school are treated
as if they are one level lower, just like the standard specialist wizard
ability. If the wizard doubles the cost to 10, he may apply this bonus to all
schools.
<P></P>
<A NAME="a4ec2e78"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>School knowledge (5/8): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This is a standard benefit for a specialist wizard. Due to the wizard’s
extensive knowledge of one school of magic, he gains a +1 bonus to saving throws
versus spells of that school, and inflicts a –1 penalty to the saving throws of his
opponents when casting spells of the school. For 8 CPs, the saving throw
modifiers increase to +2 and –2, respectively.
<P></P>
<A NAME="6a0b8a33"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Thief ability (10+): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A wizard with this talent possesses one thief ability of his choice. For every
5 additional points he spends, he may choose another thief ability. (Note that
backstab is included as a thief ability.) The wizard’s percentage scores
increase as noted in the <I>DMG </I>on <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00257.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00257.htm.php.html">Table 19</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> : Thief Average Ability Table. Modifiers for race, armor worn, and
exceptional Dexterity score all apply.
<P></P>
<A NAME="232caa8a"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon selection (10/15): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">For 10 CPs, the wizard may expand his selection of weapons to either the
cleric or thief lists (player’s choice). For 15 points, the wizard is completely
unrestricted in his choice of weapons and may gain proficiency in any weapon he
spends a slot to learn.
<P></P>
<A NAME="881f5385"></A>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon specialization (15): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">With this power, the wizard gains the ability to specialize in a weapon.
Choosing this ability doesn’t confer specialization—it merely makes it available for
the wizard, who is still required to spend the necessary CPs or proficiency
slots to actually specialize.
