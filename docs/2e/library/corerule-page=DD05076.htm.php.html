An idealist character--usually a young initiate--feels convinced that Nature
needs saving, and he's the one to do it. Always optimistic, he sometimes bites
off more than he can chew. He prefers to seek simple solutions to complex
problems.
<P></P>
The idealist is usually pure of heart, meaning he doesn't lie or cheat and has
few vices. While he seems fond of saying &quot;Nature doesn't lie,&quot; he has yet to
learn that many people do. Perhaps for that reason, people find it relatively
easy to trick this character. However, if he realizes he's been manipulated or if
he discovers corruption in someone he considered honest, his temper will flare
in a fierce fit of anger.
<P></P>
In combat, the idealist rarely uses sophisticated tactics. He prefers to wield
flashy spells, but will fight with physical weapons if necessary.
<P></P>
A young idealist usually doesn't feel ready to settle down, so sedentary kits
like the Guardian or Village Druid don't work for him. He does not possess the
bitterness of an Avenger and lacks the discipline of a Natural Philosopher and
the subtlety of a good Adviser. The best kits for him are Beastfriend,
Shapeshifter, or Wanderer.
