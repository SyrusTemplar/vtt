Firing missiles and throwing hand-held weapons (including splashing holy water
or oil) is another basic action that is very common in combat. The character
can stand still and attack at his full rate of fire, or he can make a half-move
and fire or throw missiles at 1/2 his normal rate.
<P></P>
The one exception to this move-and-fire routine is for missile weapons that
have a rate of fire less than 1/round (this includes large crossbows and most
firearms). In this case, the character wielding such a weapon can move half his
normal rate and still fire the weapon <I>only on the initial discharge of the weapon</I>. The weapon is assumed to be loaded and cocked. After this first shot, the
character can only fire the weapon as a no-move action.
<P></P>
Firing or throwing missiles is dangerous when a character is threatened by
another creature, since it creates an attack of opportunity. The only exception to
this rule is during the same combat round that the threatening creature
actually moves up to threaten the character. The character can get his shots in while
his enemy closes, but after that he had better switch to a melee weapon.
<P></P>
Characters with multiple missile attacks in the same combat round perform
their first attack on the normal action phase, and then follow with one missile per
phase until theyâ€™ve completed their full rate of fire. For example, a dart
specialist has 3 attacks per round with his darts, a fast weapon. He therefore
throws his first dart in the fast phase, the second in the average phase, and the
third in the slow phase.
<P></P>
Some monsters, such as manticores, may have multiple missiles that are fired
simultaneously. These attacks are all resolved in the same phase.
