The Oracle is the halfling cleric who deals with spiritual matters, the will
of the gods, auguries and prophecies, and the like. Whereas the Healer's
emphasis is on spells that affect his or her people directly, the Oracle is more
concerned with interpreting the gods' will to the people.
<P></P>
Roads to Adventure: The Oracle can be drawn into a quest by a prophecy that he
or she interprets as the will of the gods; alternately, like the Healer, he or
she will accompany his or her companions on their own adventures out of a
sincere belief that, without his or her help, they are doomed.
<P></P>
More than any other halfling type, the Oracle is driven by a consuming desire
to learn, to answer great questions, to complete some great quest. The drive
for such activities originates as a spiritual calling, but the Oracle with
typical halfling common sense will follow up such motivations with very practical
determination and drive.
<P></P>
Role: The Oracle seeks to be an interpreter who looks for signs of the gods'
will and then teaches his or her people what they should do. As part of that
role, he or she casts spells designed to communicate with those deities. He or she
will usually be chosen to preside over the community's occasional religious
ceremonies and festivities.
<P></P>
Secondary Skills: The Scribe secondary skill is useful to the Oracle.
<P></P>
Weapon Proficiencies: An Oracle can use any weapon allowed for the standard
cleric.
<P></P>
Bonus Nonweapon Proficiencies: The Oracle receives Astrology as a bonus
proficiency.
<P></P>
Recommended Nonweapon Proficiencies: Heraldry, Ancient History, Religion, and
Spellcraft are recommended for the Oracle.
<P></P>
Equipment: Any he or she desires.
<P></P>
Special Benefits: When the Oracle performs any spell of the sphere of
divination, he or she will receive (from the DM) unusually reliable and accurate
information. The specifics of this benefit vary by spell, of course.
<P></P>
Oracles also occasionally receive visions directly from their deities;
however, these visions are usually cryptic, requiring time and thought to unravel
their significance.
<P></P>
Special Hindrances: The Oracle is very unwilling to compromise--he or she is
more stubborn than the typical halfling. He or she treats every mission as a
quest and will never abandon a task no matter how many difficulties stand in the
way.
