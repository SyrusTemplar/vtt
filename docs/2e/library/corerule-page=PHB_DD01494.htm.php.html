</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> As protectors of nature, druids are aloof from the complications of the
temporal world. Their greatest concern is for the continuation of the orderly and
proper cycles of nature--birth, growth, death, and rebirth. Druids tend to view
all things as cyclic and thus, the battles of good and evil are only the rising
and falling tides of time. Only when the cycle and balance are disrupted does
the druid become concerned. Given this view of things, the druid must be neutral
in alignment.

Druids are charged with protecting wilderness--in particular trees, wild
plants, wild animals, and crops. By association, they are also responsible for their
followers and their animals. Druids recognize that all creatures (including
humans) need food, shelter, and protection from harm. Hunting, farming, and
cutting lumber for homes are logical and necessary parts of the natural cycle.
However, druids do not tolerate unnecessary destruction or exploitation of nature
for profit. Druids often prefer subtle and devious methods of revenge against
those who defile nature. It is well known that druids are both very unforgiving
and very patient.

Mistletoe is an important holy symbol to druids and it is a necessary part of
some spells (those requiring a holy symbol). To be fully effective, the
mistletoe must be gathered by the light of the full moon using a golden or silver
sickle specially made for the purpose. Mistletoe gathered by other means halves the
effectiveness of a given spell, if it causes damage or has an area of effect,
and grants the target a +2 bonus to his saving throw if a saving throw is
applicable.

Druids as a class do not dwell permanently in castles, cities, or towns. All
druids prefer to live in sacred groves, where they build small sod, log, or
stone cottages.
