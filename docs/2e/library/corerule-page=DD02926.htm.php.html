warriors. They roam the deserts and savannas, existing as nomadic hunters. Mature
thri-kreen are roughly seven feet tall at the shoulder, with six limbs and a tough,
sandy-colored exoskeleton. They have black compound eyes, short antennae, and
a complicated jaw structure. The thri-kreen’s uppermost four limbs are equipped
with opposable claws that can grasp tools or weapons, or serve as weapons
themselves. The thri-kreen language is made up of clicks and grindings, and they
have difficulty learning the common tongue.

Thri-kreen are organized into hunting packs, and they constantly roam their
territory. It’s unusual for a thri-kreen to leave its pack-mates and travel
alone, and even more unusual for one to take up with others not of its kind. A PC
thri-kreen has probably lost its true family in some disaster or another, and
accepts its companions as a substitute family.
