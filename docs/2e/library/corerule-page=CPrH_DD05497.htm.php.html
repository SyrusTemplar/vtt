Clerics and Druids receive 8-sided dice for hit point progression (see<I> Player'sHandbook</I>, Chapter Two). The cleric does a lot of fighting, and the druid has a very
demanding existence, living as he does in the wilderness; both need to have
comparatively high hit point totals.
<P></P>
The DM can, if he wishes, make any priesthood of a specific mythos take
six-sided dice for hit points (like rogues) or even four-sided dice (like wizards).
But this is only appropriate for priestly orders which are not very demanding
physically.
<P></P>
Most priesthoods should have eight-sided dice for hit points. If a DM decides
that a priesthood will have less robust dice, then he must compensate the
priesthood with enhanced access to spells and (especially) numerous Granted Powers
(discussed below).
<P></P>
<I>A priesthood should only receive six-sided dice</I> if it has medium to poor combat abilities, and belongs to a deity with very
few physical demands.
<P></P>
For example, a god of dawn has no intrinsic orientation toward combat, and
&quot;dawn&quot; does not imply any specific physical demands.
<P></P>
<I>A priesthood should only receive four-sided dice</I> if it has poor combat abilities, and belongs to a deity whose attribute
implies soft living.
<P></P>
For example, a god of peace or love could have priests with little or no
combat abilities and with four-sided dice. However, it's<I> important</I> to note that this does not <I>have</I> to be the case . . . It is only the case when the DM insists upon it. Priests
of the god of peace could be pacifists, but still be good at combat . . .
which they may only employ in self-defense. A god of love noted for weapons use, as
Eros was noted for his archery, could have priests who specialized in that
weapon, and would<I> not</I> have to be stuck with a measly 1d4 for hit points.
