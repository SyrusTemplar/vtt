<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Rider</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> A rider is a character who has developed a bond with his mount. When the
character was younger, he became friends with this animal, and the rider and his
mount grew up together and grew close. They are now all but inseparable. In
fact, they share such a bond they can sense each other’s location and general
health. Perhaps the rider is an elf who was born in the deep wilderness and who
rides into the campaign’s city on a giant boar. Maybe the rider is a halfling lass
who—with her giant lizard mount—leaves her village behind in pursuit of
adventure.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Benefits:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> When this kit is chosen, the player and DM must determine a suitable mount
for the character. There are several factors to consider: 1) the climate and
terrain of the character’s homeland, where he acquired the mount; 2) the
character’s race (halflings would have a difficult time riding elephants, while
half-ogres would be too big for a pony) and; 3) the availability of the mount. A rider’s
mount is similar to a wizard’s familiar in that the pair have a bond. Each
will know the general state of health of the other, the direction the other is in,
and the distance by which they are separated. Depending on its degree of
intelligence, the mount might be able to understand if its friend is in danger. Many
a rider has escaped certain death on the back of a mount that risked its own
life to save him.
<P></P>
After making a list of possible mounts, the player should select one. DMs
might prefer the mount to be selected randomly. If this is the case, use the
following method.
<P></P>
Roll 1d6. A result of 1–3 indicates the player should roll on the <A HREF="DD02992.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02992.htm">natural creatures table</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">; 4, flying creatures; 5, giant land creatures, and; 6, underwater creatures.
Then roll 1d8 on the appropriate <A HREF="DD02992.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02992.htm">mount table</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hindrances: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">If a rider neglects or mistreats his mount, the DM might declare that the
mount flees—bolts during the night, kicks its way out of a stable, flies away, etc.
If this occurs, the rider can never again experience an empathic rapport with
a animal. Further, when the rider’s mount dies, the rider immediately suffers
2d6 points of damage, due to the emotional loss resulting from the death of a
close friend. This damage can be healed. However, if the mount’s death occurred
as a result of the rider’s negligence, aside from suffering the physical damage,
the rider must attempt a saving throw vs. spells. Failure means the rider
operates as if he were under a feeblemind spell for the next 2d6 hours.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wealth:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> A rider begins with the amount of money allowed his adventuring class. He
must purchase tack and animal feed with this before using what is left to purchase
weapons, armor, and equipment.
