Characters riding a flying mount can be “unhorsed,” just like characters on
the ground. If the character is strapped into his saddle (a wise precaution), he
is simply knocked off-balance in his seat and suffers the same penalties as if
he had actually been knocked down on the ground—he is easier to hit and has to
spend an action getting back in his seat.

Naturally, if a character is not strapped in, he risks the damage of a fall if
he is unseated by any means.
