<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Does This Belong in My Campiagn?</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The <I>Player’s Option</I> combat system is an integrated set of rules that dovetails with the later
chapters in this book. However, you don’t have to use this chapter in order to
make use of the other systems.
<P></P>
This chapter presents several new combat actions, restructures the AD&amp;D
initiative system, and introduces retreats, fatigue, and critical events. Most of the
material assumes that you will use these rules with character and monster
miniatures on some kind of map. If you don’t want to run combat like this, you’ll
still find that the new initiative system and actions can be used without any
figures or maps at all.
