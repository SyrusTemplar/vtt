   A player chooses a kit for the paladin as part of the character creation
process. A paladin may have only one kit.
<P></P>
   To create a new paladin, begin by determining his ability scores (<I>PH</I>, <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01422.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01422.htm.php.html">Chapter 1</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">). Then choose his character kit, recording the pertinent information on the
character sheet. The sheets at the end of this book are designed for paladin
character kits; permission is granted to copy these pages for personal use. Use
the kit information to determine other aspects of the character, such as
proficiencies (<I>PH</I>, <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01522.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01522.htm.php.html">Chapter 5</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, and <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD05416.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD05416.htm.php.html">Chapter 5</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> of this book) and equipment (<I>PH</I>, <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01610.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01610.htm.php.html">Chapter 6</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, and <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD05420.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD05420.htm.php.html">Chapter 6</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> of this book).
<P></P>
   You can incorporate any character kit into an existing campaign, provided the
DM approves. A kit should be compatible with the paladin's personal history,
background, and established personality traits. For example, the Chevalier kit
might be a logical choice for a paladin who has devoted himself to serving a
monarch. However, the Skyrider kit would be a poor choice for a paladin who has a
fear of flying.
