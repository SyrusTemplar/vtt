This spell is similar to the 1st-level spell <I>ventriloquism</I> in that it allows the caster to throw his or her voice. However, the caster-s
voice issues only from the mouth of a specified corpse, skeleton, or zombie.
The voice coming from the cadaver or undead creature will not sound like the
caster-s voice. In the case of a cadaver or zombie, it will sound similar to the
hoarse, scratchy voice of the deceased individual. In the case of a skeleton,
the voice will sound like a soft, raspy whisper. For the duration of the spell
(which cannot be ended prematurely), the caster-s voice emanates from the corpse
or undead creature. As a result, the wizard is unable to cast any additional
spells requiring verbal components until after the <I>spectral voice</I> has expired. The material component is a preserved tongue.
