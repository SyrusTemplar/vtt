<B>Character Description:</B> The Counselor is a learned man of calm self-assurance who typically serves as
an advisor to rulers, administrators, military men, and adventurers.
<P></P>
A Counselor is typically older than other adventurers and is usually more
experienced, but could also be a younger character with a special talent for
understanding human nature or a natural empathy.
<P></P>
A man of integrity and great dignity, he is respected not only for his
knowledge, but also his insight into human behavior. He believes in moderation and
justice, and has a helping hand and kind word for all.
<P></P>
The Counselor is a good choice for players who like to play thoughtful,
even-tempered characters who are more apt to be advisors than leaders. Since novice
and low-level characters lack the experience for this personality type,
mid-level and high-level characters (especially those with high Wisdom scores) are the
best choices to be Counselors.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Best Suited For:</B> Because a Counselor's relationship with others is based on trust, characters
of good alignments are best suited for this personality type, especially lawful
good characters. Chaotic good characters can function as Counselors as well,
although this type of Counselor will be guided more by his own personal
philosophies than by any accepted standards of law and moral values. Neutral characters
tend to be too selfish; it is unlikely that other characters would turn to
them for advice. Evil Counselors are not likely to be accepted in a party whose
members are mostly good and/or lawful.
<P></P>
Any kit can be adapted to this personality type. The Academician is a logical
choice, but the Mystic and Wu Jen also make good Counselors (the Wu Jen has
much eastern wisdom to offer, while the Mystic is eager to share his insights into
the human condition).
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>In Combat Situations:</B> The Counselor is a veteran of many battles, but because he is likely to be of
advanced years, he is not the best physical combatant. He most likely will
remain in a protected position, probably near the back of the party or in a good
vantage point from which to cast spells.
<P></P>
The Counselor is also an excellent negotiator. Whenever possible, he will try
to seek common ground with an aggressor in an attempt to avoid combat. The
Counselor seldom takes the role of a military leader, but usually functions as the
leader's chief advisor and consultant.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>In Role-Playing Situations:</B> All but the most mean-spirited and evil-hearted NPCs will respect the
Counselor for his wisdom and compassion. The Counselor will never turn his back on a
person in trouble, and is forever making the problems of others his own. At the
same time, the Counselor is a shrewd judge of character and is usually the
first to spot a charlatan or a duplicitous NPC.
<P></P>
In a campaign, the Counselor is everybody's best friend. He always has time to
hear his companions' problems, no matter how trivial, and serves as a source
of both comfort and sage advice
