<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sword +1, +2 vs. magic-using and enchanted creatures:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This sword always provides a +1 bonus. The +2 bonus takes effect when the
sword is employed against wizards, monsters that can cast spells, and conjured,
created, gated, or summoned creatures. Note that the +2 bonus would not operate
against a creature magically empowered by an item (such as a <I>ring of spell storing</I>) to cast spells.
