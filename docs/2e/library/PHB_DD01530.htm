</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Knowing how to use a weapon without embarrassing yourself is very different
from being a master of that weapon. There are warriors, and then there are
martial artists. An Olympic fencer is more than just an athlete; he can do things
with his weapon that astound most fencers.

In the AD&amp;D game, part of your character's skill is reflected in the bonuses
he earns as he reaches higher levels. As your character advances, he becomes a
wiser, more dangerous fighter. Experience has taught him to anticipate his
opponents and to pounce on any advantage that presents itself. But this is a
general, overall improvement, brought about by the warrior's sharpening senses and
timing. It applies equally to all types of fighting.
<P></P>
Weapon specialization is an optional rule that enables a fighter (only) to
choose a single weapon and specialize in its use. Any weapon may be chosen.
Specialization is normally announced (and paid for with weapon proficiency slots)
when the character is created. But even after a player character earns experience,
he can still choose to specialize in a weapon, provided he has the weapon
proficiency slots available.
<P></P>
In one way, a weapon specialist is like a wizard specialist. The
specialization requires a single-minded dedication and training. Thus, multi-class
characters cannot use weapon specialization; it is available only to single-class
fighters.
