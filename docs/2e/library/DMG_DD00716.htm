hour of quaffing the liquid. Each potion contains enough liquid for four small
draughts. One draught allows the imbiber to breathe a cone of fire 10 feet wide
and up to 20 feet long that inflicts 1d10 + 2 points of damage (d10 + 2). A
double draught doubles the range and damage. If the entire potion is taken at
once, the cone is 20 feet wide, up to 80 feet long, and inflicts 5d10 points of
damage. Saving throws vs. breath weapon for half damage apply in all cases. If the
flame is not expelled before the hour expires, the potion fails, with a 10%
chance that the flames erupt in the imbiber's system, inflicting double damage
upon him, with no saving throw allowed.
