<FONT SIZE="3">This particular spell was the last and most powerful
spell developed by the archmentalist Rheizom. It allows the wizard to
selectively destroy, alter, or implant memories in the subject
creature as he sees fit. He can completely reprogram a character,
inventing a new persona, a new alignment, and assigning a new class
as he sees fit. Only sentient beings can be affected; if the subject
is not human, humanoid, or demihuman, he gains a +4 bonus on his
saving throw.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">As described above, <I>programmed amnesia </I>can be
used to achieve several different effects. The wizard may choose to
make use of any or all of the effects listed below:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>A. Memory erasure. </B>Any or all memories
possessed by the subject can be erased at the caster&#146;s will,
including knowledge of specific events, people, or places.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>B. Memory implant. </B>The caster can create false
memories in the subject&#146;s mind as he sees fit. Imaginary
friends, events that didn&#146;t really take place, betrayals by
people the subject regards as his friends, or the friendship of an
enemy could all be implanted in the subject&#146;s mind.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>C. Skill erasure. </B>The subject can be made to
forget any or all class-based skills or proficiencies, including all
or part of his THAC0 (it resets to 20), thief abilities,
spellcasting, turning undead, or any other ability that stems from
knowledge. About the only characteristics that can&#146;t be affected
by this usage of <I>Rheizom&#146;s programmed amnesia </I>are hit
points, saving throws, and ability scores. A character&#146;s native
language cannot be erased, either.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>D. Persona erasure. </B>Combining the effects of a
skill erasure and a memory erasure, this leaves the subject as a
clean slate. Only his ability scores, hit points, saving throws, and
native language remain. The character may assume any class or
alignment available, beginning as a 1st-level character just as if he
had decided to dual-class. (Even demihumans can dual-class in this
fashion, since they forget all skills of their previous class.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>E. Persona implant. </B>By erasing the existing
personality and implanting a false set of memories, the wizard can
build a new persona for the mind-wiped character. In effect, he can
decide what class, alignment, and personality the subject will assume
after his persona erasure. If the new persona is an adventurer, the
character dual-classes, as described above.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>F. Programmed erasure. </B>The subject can be
programmed to suffer a memory, skill, or persona erasure when a
certain event takes place. For example, the wizard could set the
subject to be wiped clean as a slate when the subject receives a
coded message or arrives at some destination. Optionally, the wizard
can decide to have an erasure partially or totally lifted when the
programmed condition comes to pass.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The casting time of this spell varies according to
what effects the wizard wishes to impose on the subject. To cast just
one of the listed effects, the wizard must spend two days secluded
away from any distractions&#151;a personal laboratory is a good
example of a secluded place. In between the intense eight-hour
casting sessions, the wizard can sleep and eat in the area he chose
to seclude himself in. If the wizard breaks his seclusion for any
reason, the spell is lost. Also, for every effect over the first,
another day (with its eight-hour intense casting period) must be
spent in seclusion.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The wizard must be able to see the spell&#146;s
subject. At the end of each day of casting, the subject makes a
saving throw vs. spell to negate the effect.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>Programmed amnesia </I>is normally permanent,
unless the wizard cares to specify a set of conditions or parameters
that will end the effect (see F, above). Its effects can only be
undone by a <I>restoration </I>or <I>wish </I>spell, or by successful
use of the psionic science psychic surgery. A character who picks up
new skills or class abilities while amnesiac must make a saving throw
vs. spell when his own real memories return; if he fails, the skills
he learned as an amnesiac are gone forever, replaced by his former
abilities, but if he succeeds he retains any new skills, and may even
choose to continue in his new class as a dual-classed character.
Dungeon Masters should keep in mind that an amnesiac character should
still meet the new class&#146;s full prerequisites before he can
become that class.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Obviously, this is a very powerful spell, and the DM
should very carefully examine a PC&#146;s use of this magic. Dungeon
Masters, take note&#151;there are dozens of excellent plot vehicles
hiding here if an NPC wizard uses this on a player character! Also,
be aware that destroying a creature&#146;s personality and replacing
it with one more amenable to the wizard&#146;s designs is never a
good act.</FONT></P>
