</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Any brawling attack provokes an attack of opportunity from any and all
opponents who are armed and threatening the assailant. The defender gets a +4 bonus to
attack and damage rolls. If an attack of opportunity slays the attacker, there
is no brawling attack. If an attack of opportunity creates a knockdown chance,
the brawling attack automatically fails and is wasted, even if the attacker’s
saving throw succeeds and he is not knocked down—the defender’s weapon keeps
the attacker at bay. If an attack of opportunity results in a critical hit, the
character who scored the hit can choose to roll for the critical hit (see <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02717.htm.php.html#bcdf214c"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02717.htm.php.html#bcdf214c">Chapter Six</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">) or force the brawling attack to automatically fail.
