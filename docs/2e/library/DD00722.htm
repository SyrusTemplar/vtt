increase. Garments and other worn and carried gear also grow in size. Each fourth of
the liquid consumed causes 6 feet of height growthâ€”in other words, a full potion
increases height by 24 feet. Weight increases should be proportional to the
change in height. Strength is increased sufficiently to allow bearing armor and
weapons commensurate with the increased size, but does not provide combat
bonuses. Movement increases to that of a giant of approximately equal size.
