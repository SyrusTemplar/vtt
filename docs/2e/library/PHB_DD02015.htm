<I>Bigby's forceful hand</I> is a more powerful version of <I>Bigby's interposing hand</I>. It creates a man-sized (5 feet) to gargantuan-sized (21 feet) hand that
places itself between the spellcaster and a chosen opponent. This disembodied hand
then moves to remain between the two, regardless of what the spellcaster does
or how the opponent tries to get around it. However, the forceful hand also
pushes on the opponent. This force can push away a creature weighing 500 pounds or
less, slow movement to 10 feet per round if the creature weighs between 500 and
2,000 pounds, or slow movement by 50% if the creature weighs more than 2,000
pounds.
<P></P>
A creature pushed away is pushed to the range limit, or until pressed against
an unyielding surface. The hand itself inflicts no damage. The forceful hand
has an Armor Class of 0, has as many hit points as its caster in full health, and
vanishes when destroyed. The caster can cause it to retreat (to release a
trapped opponent, for example) or dismiss it on command.
<P></P>
The material component is a glove.
