</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Locked Spells:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B> </B>When two spells lock, they remain in place until another spell enters the
space and destroys the opposing spell. No spell can move through a space containing
locked spells, even if it normally could ignore the opposing spell. Once the
opposing spell is destroyed, all the blocked spells are free to move normally.
<P></P>
For example, the <I>charm person</I> and <I>cure light wounds</I> spells from the previous example are locked. There is no further combat
between the two spells until a third spell moves into the space. The next spell to
move is a <I>magic missile</I> that belongs to Rary. <I>Magic missile</I> is a type M spell that normally ignores type D spells, so it cannot destroy
the <I>cure light wounds</I> spell and is blocked until the lock is cleared. The next spell to move is
Sertenâ€™s <I>dispel magic</I>. <I>Dispel magic</I> is an AD spell that normally fights the type A spell <I>charm person</I>. If the <I>dispel magic</I> spell destroys the <I>charm person</I> spell, the lock is cleared. If not, the lock continues and spells are still
blocked from advancing past the lock.
<P></P>
It is possible to have multiple locked spells in the same space. When this
occurs, each spell that enters the space must check against all locked spells in
the area. Once all opposing spells are defeated, the lock is cleared.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Combat Between Multiple Spells:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B> </B>If a spell enters a space containing more than one opposing spell, all the
spells must be checked for combat.
<P></P>
If there is a lock in the space, the opposing spell that caused the lock is
checked first. If the incoming spell cannot battle the locking spell, the
incoming spell is blocked and no combat occurs between it and any other spell in the
space until the lock is removed.
<P></P>
If there is no lock in the space, the opposing spell with the highest movement
rate is checked for combat. If there is no combat or the incoming spell wins
the combat, the spell with the next highest movement rate is checked. This
process continues until the incoming spell is destroyed or all opposing spells have
been checked. If a lock occurs during the process, all combat stops until the
lock is cleared.
<P></P>
If there are multiple locks in the space, the incoming spell checks the
opposing locked spell with the highest movement rate for combat. If the incoming
spell cannot conduct combat with that spell, no combat occurs and all the locks
remain in place. If the incoming spell defeats the first locking spell, it checks
for combat with the next fastest locking spell and so on until all the opposing
locks are checked or until the incoming spell is locked or defeated.
<P></P>
When all locks are removed from a space containing multiple opposing spells,
there is no further combat until another spell enters the space. The spell
entering the space checks the opposing spell with the highest movement rate and
continues checking until all the opposing spells have been checked or the spell is
locked or defeated.
