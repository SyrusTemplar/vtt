The material on the <A HREF="PHB_DD01553.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01553.htm">Bowyer/Fletcher</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> proficiency from the Player-s Handbook<I>,</I> page 58, is all correct for use with this supplement.
<P></P>
A set of bowyer/fletcher's tools, which can be used at maximum efficiency by
one character, costs 10 gp. (It's 15 gp for a set which can be used
simultaneously by three workers, and +7.5 gp per +3 workers which can work simultaneously.)
The bowyer/fletcher is not required to set up a workshop; he can work by
himself in the field, if he chooses. If he chooses to set up a permanent shop, tents
and huts cost the same as what's listed for the leatherworker's shop (above,
under &quot;Armorer&quot;).
<P></P>
Note that the construction times listed in the <I>Player's Handbook</I> presume that he's working a full week. If he's traveling or adventuring and
working on bows and arrows in his spare time, multiply all crafting times by
four. Thus, a long or short bow takes four weeks.
<P></P>
Cost of materials for arrows and normal bows is negligible. If the character
is trying to make a weapon of truly fine quality, he must either pay 50% of the
weapon's normal retail value for exceptionally fine woods, or add an extra 100%
to the time it takes to craft the weapon; the extra time constitutes him
having to look for the perfect wood and materials in the wild.
