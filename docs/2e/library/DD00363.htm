This chapter contains instructions for determining specific experience awards.
It also gives guidelines about awarding experience in general. However, it
does not provide absolute mathematical formulas for calculating experience in
every situation.
<P></P>
Awarding experience points (XP) is one of the DM's most difficult jobs. The
job is difficult because there are only a few rules (and a lot of guidelines) for
the DM to rely on. The DM must learn nearly everything he knows about
experience points from running game sessions. There is no magical formula or die roll
to determine if he is doing the right or wrong thing. Only time, instinct, and
player reactions will tell.
