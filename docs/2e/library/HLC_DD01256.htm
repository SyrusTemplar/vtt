<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A legendary monster with this power sends creatures with less than 4+1 hit
dice and characters of 4th level or less fleeing in panic on sight if the creature
is attacking or charging. Panicked creatures flee for 2d4 turns, as though
affected by the 4th-level wizard spell <I>fear</I>.
<P></P>
More powerful characters are affected only if they are within the creature?s
fear radius, and then only if the creature consciously employs its fear power.
Opponents who do not automatically flee are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to
avoid the effect, but there is usually a penalty to the roll.
