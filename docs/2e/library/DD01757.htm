<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>Sometimes an encounter, either random or planned by the DM, catches one of the
two groups involved totally off guard. This is called <I>surprise</I> and is determined by rolling 1d10 for each side (or only one side if the DM
has decided that one of the sides cannot be surprised, for some reason). If the
die roll is a 1, 2, or 3, that group or character is surprised (for effects,
see the “<A HREF="DD01758.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01758.htm">Effects of Surprise</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">” section). Naturally, surprise does not happen all the time. There are many
easy and intelligent ways it can be prevented. The most obvious is if the player
characters can see those they are about to encounter well before getting close.
<P></P>
For example, the characters may see the dust of a group of horsemen coming
their way, or notice the lanterns of a group of peasants coming through the woods,
or hear the grunting barks of a gnoll war party closing through the trees. In
these cases there is no way the characters are going to be surprised by the
encounter. But if a leopard leaped upon one of the group while he was intently
watching the approaching riders, or if a group of goblins suddenly sprang from the
darkness, then the characters would have to roll to see if they were
surprised. They were unprepared for these threats and so could be taken off guard.
<P></P>
The DM decides when a check for surprise must be made. He can require that one
roll be made for the entire party, that a separate check be made for each
character, or that only specific characters check. This depends entirely upon the
situation.
<P></P>
For example, the entire party is intently watching the band of approaching
riders. Then a leopard leaps from the branches of a tree overhead. The DM knows
that no one in the group was particularly paying attention to the treetops, so he
has one person in the group roll the surprise die for the entire party. The
roll is a 2, the PCs are surprised, the leopard gets a free round of attacks, and
there is mass confusion as the clawing, biting creature lands in their midst!
If two of the characters had been on a general watch, the DM could have had
these characters roll for surprise instead of the entire group. If both were
surprised, the entire group would have been unprepared for the leopard's attack.
Otherwise, one or both of the guards might have noticed the creature before it
pounced. Experienced player characters quickly learn the value of having someone
on watch at all times.
<P></P>
The surprise roll can also be modified by Dexterity, race, class, cleverness,
and situation. The DM has the listing of modifiers that apply to given
situations. Modifiers can affect either your character's chance of being surprised or
his chance of surprising others. A plus to your die roll reduces the odds that
you are surprised; a minus increases those odds. Likewise, a minus to the
enemy's die roll means that the modifier is in your favor, while a plus means that
things are going his way. High Dexterity characters are virtually unsurpriseable,
caught off guard only in unusual situations.
<P></P>
It is important to bear in mind that surprise and ambush are two different
things. Surprise works as explained above. An ambush is prepared by one group to
make an unexpected attack on another group and works only if the DM decides the
other group cannot detect the ambush. A properly set ambush gives the attackers
the opportunity to use spells and normal attacks before the other side reacts.
If the ambush succeeds, the ambushing group gets its initial attack <I>and</I> the other group must roll for surprise in the next round, so the ambushing
group may get two rounds of attacks before the other group can reply.
