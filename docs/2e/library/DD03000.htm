<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Swashbuckler</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A swashbuckler is the lightly armed and armored hero with a flashing blade
and rapier wit. Most at home in a city-based campaign (dungeons tend to ruin
their expensive, foppish attire), the swashbuckler seems to have stepped right out
of Dumas’ <I>The Three Musketeers.</I> Swashbucklers may be dull bureaucrats, wheezing aristocrats, or meek scribes
during the day—but at night they don their fanciest clothes, gird on their
blades, and venture out into the darkening city for an evening of raucous revelry,
flippant conversation, and a helping of derring-do. Despite a generally
flippant (some might say arrogantly sarcastic) attitude, most swashbucklers have a
strong sense of honor. Anyone who dares insult the swashbuckler, his comrades, or
a member of the opposite sex may well find a blade at his throat.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Requirements:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Swashbucklers should be witty, and they should be light on their feet for
those occasions when their wit goes unappreciated. As such, all swashbucklers need
minimum Dexterity/Balance and Intelligence/Reason scores of 12. This kit is
closed to the optional player character races, and to rangers and druids.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended weapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Swords are the traditional weapons of most swashbucklers, especially rapiers
and sabres. However, they can use any weapons that fit their adventuring
professions.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended Nonweapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Tumbling, etiquette, dancing, riding, blind-fighting, musical instrument,
appraising, gaming, tightrope walking, jumping.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Equipment:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A swashbuckler can wear any armor and weapons allowed to his class, though
they should be flashy and of good quality.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended traits:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Ambidexterity, artistic ability, glibness, music, lucky.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Benefits:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> When unarmored or wearing armor no heavier than studded leather,
swashbucklers gain a +2 armor class bonus. This bonus is in addition to any other AC
modifiers such as a high Dexterity and magical defensive items. (This is equal to the
optional defensive bonus class ability, and the two cannot be combined.) Also,
due to their roguish charm, swashbucklers gain a +2 reaction roll bonus from
NPC members of the opposite sex.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hindrances:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> As the swashbuckler seeks out adventure, so too does adventure find him.
Life, and the DM, should conspire to make reality interesting for the character.
For example, if a swashbuckler is fleeing the outraged sibling of one of his
paramours, his flight might carry him across the path of a defenseless peasant who
is being harassed by a gang of ruffians. Or, if a swashbuckler leaps overboard
to escape the buccaneers who shanghaied him, he discovers that the waters are
infested with sahuagin riding sharks.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wealth:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Standard for the character’s class, plus 20% to reflect his affluent
background.
