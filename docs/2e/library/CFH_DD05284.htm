These rules can be used for monsters, too, even those with extra limbs and
body parts (extra heads, wings, tails, etc.). As with humans, it takes a &quot;Numbed&quot;
shot (one-fourth the monster's hit points in a single blow) to numb an area for
one round, and a &quot;Useless&quot; shot (one-half the monster's hit points in a single
blow) to incapacitate the body part for an entire fight.
<P></P>
Remember that the &quot;Useless&quot; number does <I>not</I> mean that the monster (or character) has 50% of its hit points invested in
that body part; if it did, a creature might have more than 300% of its own hit
points! The &quot;Numbed&quot; and &quot;Useless&quot; numbers are just ways to determine how much
damage it takes to incapacitate a certain body part, and the hit point damage is
always applied to the victim's normal hit point score.
