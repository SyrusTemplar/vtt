<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> In addition to dying when hit points reach 0, a character also runs the risk
of dying abruptly when he suffers massive amounts of damage. A character who
suffers 50 or more points of damage from a single attack must roll a successful
saving throw vs. death, or he dies.
<P></P>
This applies only if the damage was done by a single attack. Multiple attacks
totaling 50 points in a single round don't require a saving throw.
<P></P>
For example, a character would be required to make a check if a dragon
breathed on him for 72 points of damage. He wouldn't have to do so if eight orcs hit
him for a total of 53 points of damage in that round.
<P></P>
If the saving throw is successful, the character remains alive (unless of
course the 50-hit-point loss reduced his hit points to 0 or below!). If the saving
throw fails, the character immediately dies from the intense shock his body has
taken. His hit points are reduced to 0.
<P></P>
The character may still be raised in the normal ways, however.
