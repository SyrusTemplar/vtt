<FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="4"><B>The Lord of Undead</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="1">
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The King of Ghouls is the deity of the undying. He represents the desire to
persist in the physical world beyond the grave, the unnatural craving to preserve
one's personality after life. The god symbolizes the power of the mind over
the needs of the spirit and body. As such, he is the devourer of souls and
cannibal of the dead. His dark will first changes and ultimately consumes the human
body after death. The god loves venom, putrefaction and decay; his heralds are
the worm, vulture, and hyena.
<P></P>
The priests of this god, also known as Charnelists, worship all undead as an
embodiment of their deity. Even the most humble animated skeleton is a symbol of
his power and must be treated with respect. The Charnelists are protectors and
allies of undead; some groups chose a single undead form and revere it as a
sacred icon of their god. Others seek to create new undead to serve their deity,
or to convert existing undead to his worship. Those who refuse to convert are
destroyed, their dust scattered to the winds as a warning to others. This evil
and destructive priesthood is only appropriate for NPCs in the campaign.
<P></P>
<B>Alignment:</B> The God of Undead is lawful evil, but his priesthood may of any evil
alignment (neutral and lawful types predominate). Worshippers are usually neutral or
evil in alignment.
<P></P>
<B>Minimum Ability Scores:</B> Intelligence 13, Wisdom 14.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Charnelists employ bludgeoning weapons common to most priests, preferring the
spiked mace and flail in melee (they prefer to fight two-handed, if Dexterity
permits). They may also learn the warhammer, staff, sling, and club.
<P></P>
<B>Dress/Armor Allowed:</B> These priests favor somber plum robes, limned in silver thread, worn over
blackened plate or chain mail. Instead of a helm, they wear an ornate silver
circlet that is fashioned like a crown of worms. They may not use any form of shield.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Required (this new wizard skill takes 1 slot only): necrology. Recommended:
(General) herbalism (poison manufacture), etiquette, heraldry; (Wizard) anatomy;
(Priest) herbalism, reading/writing, religion, spellcraft. (Rogue): disguise,
reading lips. Forbidden: none.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> The King of Undead, known by some as Thasmudyan, is only publicly worshiped
in a few cities isolated from mainstream civilization by tall mountains, the
forbidding desert, or the trackless sea. In these backward locales, the main
temple serves literally as a charnel house where the bodies of the dead are
deposited by the citizens as an offering. There the cadavers rot and decay until they
are consumed by the King's avatar and his fanatical clergy. These cities almost
always have a dark and sinister reputation, one that is quite well-deserved for
what should be obvious reasons. Worship of the Ghoul God is strictly forbidden
in most civilized nations, forcing the religion to operate there like a secret
society.
<P></P>
Each separate priesthood of the Lord of Undead has its own agenda of magical
research related to death and the undead. Despite this division, or perhaps
because of it, the individual temples communicate effectively with each other,
either by spell or magical item. Some priesthoods investigate deadly poisons that
will create new forms of undead; others try to mate and crossbreed humans with
other venomous creatures, attempting to create a superior race of undead beings.
<P></P>
A few temples operate like the Cult of the Dragon in the Forgotten Realms,
which seeks out evil dragons and converts them into dracoliches, the focus of
their religion. Others, like the Cult of Worms described in Chapter Nine of this
book, strive to spread knowledge about attaining lichdom to any interested
person. Whatever their specific role, the Charnelists are yet another potential
nemesis for the campaign.
<P></P>
<B>Spheres of Influence:</B> Major Access to All, Astral, Charm, Necromantic, Summoning, Thought <I>(TOM)</I>. Minor Access to Combat, Divination, Protection, and Sun.
<P></P>
<B>Granted Necromantic Spells:</B> 1st: <I>invisibility to undead, skeletal servant, spectral senses, undead alacrity</I>; 2nd: <I>aid, resist turning, slow poison</I>; 3rd: <I>animate dead, death's door, feign death, life drain, negative plane
protection, speak with dead</I>; 4th: <I>cause insanity/cure insanity, poison/neutralize poison</I>; 5th: <I>dispel good, imbue undead with spell ability, slay living, scourge, undead
regeneration</I>; 6th: <I>asphyxiate, summon undead</I>; 7th: <I>death pact, destruction, energy drain, mindkiller (TOM), wither</I>; Quest: <I>undead plague (TOM)</I>.
<P></P>
<B>Granted Powers:</B> Charnelists have great authority over any undead they encounter. Starting at
first level, they affect three times the regular number of creatures per
successful turning attempt (this translates to 6d6 undead, plus 6d4 extra creatures
when denoted by a * on </FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3">Table 47</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> on page 67 of the <I>DMG</I>).
<P></P>
Once a priest reaches 6th level, he or she gains the ability to fashion
exceptional undead; any skeletons or zombies which are animated (either by<I> skeletal servant</I> or <I>animate dead</I>) gain an additional +1 hit point per hit die.
<P></P>
Starting at 9th level, the priests learn all of the secret rites that create
powerful undead. They first learn how to make ghouls or ghasts (9th level).
Then, at 12th level, they learn to create ju-ju zombies and mummies. Finally, at
16th level, they learn the secrets of vampirism and lichdom. All of these rites
require numerous sacrifices (from 1?20 fresh corpses) and vast amounts of wealth
in the form of rare components (1,000?20,000 gp). Even if both were available
in unlimited quantities, the ritual can still only be performed once a month
and creates but one undead creature.
<P></P>
Eventually, once a priest has received permission from his or her deity
(usually after performing some notable deed or quest for the benefit of the
religion), the priest will undergo the process of performing the transformation upon
him- or herself, joining the mighty Lord of Undead in (potentially) everlasting
undeath. This is the ultimate dream for many such priests.
<P></P>
<B>Other Limitations:</B> The Ghoul God is a ravenous deity, demanding constant sacrifice. Usually dead
bodies (the more recently dead, the better) are preferred, but exhumed
cadavers can serve as a substitute in times of need or persecution (which happens as
often as one might come to expect of such a morbid cult).
<P></P>
Thasmudyan's worship is rumored to include several obscene rituals, the least
of which includes cannibalism of the dead and necrophilia. Charnelists are
accordingly forbidden from marrying or engaging in any intimate relations with the
living.
<P></P>
<B>Possible Symbols:</B> The Vulture, the Hyena, Skeletal Hand, Crown of Worms.
