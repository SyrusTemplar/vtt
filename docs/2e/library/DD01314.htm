</B>Individual Spells? Special Abilities
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
There are several special abilities common to several spells.
<P></P>
<I>Automatic Defeat:</I> If a spell automatically defeats another spell, it always wins a combat with
the listed spell or spell group. This applies when it is used as a counter
spell as well.
<P></P>
<I>Cannot be Locked:</I> When a spell cannot be locked by another type of spell, any lock result
destroys the opposing spell unless some other special lock effect is specified.
<P></P>
<I>Counter: </I>When a spell is listed as a counter to another spell or type of spell, it can
be employed as a counter spell against the listed type even if combat between
the two spells is not normally possible. When a spell is listed as an automatic
counter to another spell, it destroys the listed spell without a die roll when
cast as a counter spell.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Antimagic Shell:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Missiles and leeches must battle this spell, and it cannot be locked by any

<P></P>
<I>
<P></P>
</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Bigby-s Hand/Fist Spells:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> These spells conduct character combat when they reach the opponent-s square,
just as if they were summoned creatures. <I>Bigby-s interposing hand</I> inflicts no damage, but prevents the opponent from casting any spells until
it is destroyed. Other spells inflict damage as listed in their descriptions.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Blade Barrier:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This spell cannot be locked by spells that summon creatures.

caster cannot cast counter spells during that time.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Chaotic Commands?:</I> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">When used as a counter spell, chaotic commands always defeats spells that
allow the caster to command or control the recipient, such as <I>command, charm person,</I> and <I>suggestion</I>. Whenever victorious against such a spell, the two opponents must conduct
character combat. If the caster of <I>chaotic commands</I> wins, the opposing spell reverses direction and moves toward the original
caster, functioning as one of the victorious caster-s spells. If the caster of <I>chaotic commands</I> loses the personal combat, the spell is negated.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<I>Contact Other Plane:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Casting this spell in a duel does not cause insanity. This spell cannot be
locked in spell vs. spell combat. If a lock occurs, the two spells ignore each
other instead. A lock still destroys this spell if the combat takes place in a
character-s space.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Continual Light:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> When employed as an attack spell, this spell blinds the opponent (save vs.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Control Temperature, 10? Radius:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This spell can be cast to raise or reduce the temperature; the caster chooses

<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Cure Blindness or Deafness:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This spell counters any spell that obscures vision. If locked in combat by a <I>blindness </I>spell, both spells are destroyed instead.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Demishadow Magic:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> When this spell reaches the opponent-s space, the opponent must roll a saving
throw vs. spell before casting any counter spells. If the save fails, the
spell inflicts 10d6 points of damage, but the caster can attempt a counter spell or
a save vs. spell to reduce the damage to 5d6 points. If the initial save
succeeds, the spell inflicts 4d6 points of damage, and the caster is free to employ
a counter spell or attempt a second saving throw to reduce the damage to 2d6
points.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Demishadow Monsters:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This spell functions as any other creature-summoning spell. When it reaches
the opponent-s space, the opponent rolls a saving throw vs. spells. If the save
succeeds, the creatures inflict 2d6 points of damage with a successful attack
instead of 5d6 points of damage.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Detect Magic:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The opposing spell is revealed even if the <I>detect magic</I> spell is locked or destroyed in combat. A priest must roll a power check,
using the character-s power score, to discover what the opposing spell is. The
wizard version does not require a power check.

spells.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Dispel Magic:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> If locked or defeated in combat, this can destroy the opposing spell. A
normal dispel roll is required (see <A HREF="DD01278.htm#2606007c"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01278.htm#2606007c">spell description</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). Note that some spells cannot be dispelled. The spell dissipates when it

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Elemental Aura?:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The caster chooses the type of <I>elemental aura</I> that is created (air, earth, fire, or water). An<I> elemental aura</I> battles every spell from its element that it meets, regardless of type, and
cannot be locked by any spell employing its element-this spell is destroyed
instead. If employed as a counter spell, <I>elemental aura </I>automatically destroys spells of its own element.

<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Endure Heat/Endure Cold: </I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This spell can be cast to protect against heat or cold; the caster chooses

opposing effect.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Energy Drain: </I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">If the target-s combat roll or counter spell fails, the character loses two
levels. The level loss persists until the duel ends. The target loses hit points
and spell slots commensurate with the level loss, but empty spell slots can be
used to satisfy the loss. The target-s power score is unaffected, but saving
throws are adjusted accordingly.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Enervation: </I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">If the target-s saving throw or counter spell fails, the character loses one
level for every four levels of the caster. The level loss persists until the

power score is unaffected, but saving throws are adjusted accordingly.
<P></P>
<P></P>

as a leech.

useless as a counter spell.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Fire Seeds: </I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This spell conducts combat when it enters the opponent-s square. The opponent

attack, attack/defense, missile, or leech spell, it inflicts 10d6 points of
damage (save vs. spells for half). When used as a defense spell, limited wish
cannot be locked by any spell of 6th level or less. As a counter spell, <I>limited wish </I>automatically counters any spell of 6th level or lower and can serve as a
counter to all other spells. Using <I>limited wish </I>in a duel does not age the caster unless the spell is actually lost from
memory in the aftermath (see the <A HREF="DD01306.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01306.htm">Spoils of Victory</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> section).

than five missiles can launch their remaining missiles the next round or forgo
the extra missiles and take another action instead. Extra missiles can counter
creature-summoning spells that enter the character-s square. Each group of
missiles launched functions as a separate spell in the arena. When a group of
missiles reaches the opponent-s square, the group conducts character combat. If it
succeeds, it inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage for each missile in the group.

combat with a +4 bonus. The actual number rolled determines success or failure,
but a successful roll is treated as four higher when comparing rolls. For
example, a caster with a PR 13 rolls 12, and the opponent, who also has a PR of 13
rolls a 13. The caster wins because his roll of 12 is treated as a 16.

conducts character combat. If it succeeds, it inflicts 1d6+2 points of damage for
