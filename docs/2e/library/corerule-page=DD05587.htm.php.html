<P></P>
This god is the deity of combat and warfare. He exists only to promote and
participate in bloody battle.
<P></P>
Each nation has priests of this god, and in each nation the priests constitute
a separate cult; they do not cooperate with one another in times of war,
especially when their armies are opposed. They help train new warriors, teach
battlefield tactics, and make records of the most valiant fights of any war or battle.
<P></P>
In painful times of peace, these individual sects may cooperate with one
another. However, they usually only do so to conspire and start up another war.
<P></P>
Lesser gods of war will be gods of some secondary aspect. One might be the god
of Berserker Rages, another the god of Battlefield Terror, another the god of
Confusion, another the god of Tactics, another the god of Cavalry... and so on.
<P></P>
The chief war-god is male, but lesser war-gods are as likely to be female as
male.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Community,
Culture, Guardianship, Justice/Revenge, Messengers, Metalwork, Mischief/Trickery,
