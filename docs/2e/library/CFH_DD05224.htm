Finally, the Called Shot can be used for a variety of special results,
especially neat and interesting results such as the ones you see in movies and
fiction. Examples:
<P></P>
<B>Carving Initials Into Someone. </B>Each successful Called Shot will enable a character with a sharp blade to
slice one letter or initial into a tabletop, a wall—or the flesh of an opponent.
This does only one point of damage, and has one of two results: Against an enemy
of equal or lower level or influence, it can cause the enemy to lose morale or
surrender (DM choice); against an enemy of equal or higher level or influence,
it will be considered such an insult that this enemy will not rest until you
are dead. Thus, it is best performed against enemy minions to impress and scare
them, to persuade them to run away or help you. Performed against enemies who
are your equal in ability or status, this maneuver merely earns you a foe for
life.
<P></P>
<B>Cutting Buttons Off.</B> Each successful Called Shot will enable a character to snip off one button,
brooch, gem or other sartorial element from an enemy's outfit. It can also be
used to flip a necklace off someone's head, spring the catch on a bracelet, etc.
This has the same good effects as carving initials into someone, but will not
earn you the enmity of an opponent who is your equal.
<P></P>
<B>Stapling.</B> This classic maneuver is best performed with a thrown knife or with an arrow
or quarrel, though it can be performed with sharp melee weapons. The target
must be near some piece of furniture or wall, and that furniture or wall should be
wood, plaster, or any other material that such a weapon will penetrate. With a
successful Called Shot, you staple some item of the target's clothing (your
choice) to that nearby surface. The target must spend a combat round getting
himself free. (This does not require any sort of roll; it just takes a few moments
to pull the knife free, tear the cloth of his garment, whatever it takes.) If
someone attacks him while he is pinned, he suffers a –2 penalty to AC (i.e., a 3
becomes a 5) and attacks. If the target is stapled and must defend himself
while trying to tear himself free, he suffers those AC and attack penalties but
will be able to tear himself free after a total of three rounds.
<P></P>
<B>Hostage-Taking.</B> If a character successfully grabs a victim during one round (see the Grab
maneuver, below), he may use a Called Shot on his next round to put his dagger to
the hostage's throat. This does no damage to the hostage, but the attacker can
then, at any time, drive the knife home for twice normal damage (which he will
probably do if the hostage does not surrender, or if someone else he is
threatening does not surrender.)
