<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Diplomat</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> In any campaign that involves government and politics, diplomats and other
courtiers are bound to appear. Diplomats can bring important messages to
neighboring countries. They might?as adventurers?explore uncharted regions and act as
emissaries. Or they could be attached to a foreign court as their lord?s
representative, advising the foreign ruler of the attitudes and policies of the
diplomat?s homeland. Diplomats also act as their rulers? eyes and ears in a distant
court.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A diplomat can wield any weapons that fit his character class. However, since
a diplomat is usually a peaceful individual, if he wears heavy armor and
carries lots of weapons he might be viewed suspiciously. Diplomats are at their best
appearing inoffensive.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended nonweapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Dancing, etiquette, heraldry, history (any), languages (any, numerous
preferred), reading lips, and riding (any).

should be of superior quality and appearance.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended traits:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Allure, alertness, artistic ability, glibness, music (any), obscure
knowledge, and precise memory.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Benefits:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Since the diplomat?s nature is to put others at ease, he receives a +2 bonus
to all reaction rolls.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hindrances:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Diplomats are often far from home, essentially at the mercy of a foreign
ruler. If the diplomat delivers a message that the ruler doesn?t appreciate, the
ruler may take out his anger on the messenger. During wartime, diplomats live
especially dangerous lives, as they frequently must travel across enemy lines and
battlefields to perform their duties.
