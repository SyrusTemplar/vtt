<FONT SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR="RED">Chapter Seven:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR="RED">Weapons &amp; Armor</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Characters are defined not only by their abilities and
alignment, but also by their possessions and equipment. With the
proper preparation and gear, there&#146;s almost nothing a daring
hero can&#146;t accomplish.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">This chapter presents a comprehensive listing of just
about any kind of weapon or armor a character would ever want to use.
The list is divided into nine different semi-historical groupings to
help preserve consistency and accuracy. For example, the most
sophisticated armor available during Western Europe&#146;s Dark Ages
was chain mail; plate mail hadn&#146;t been invented yet. If a
particular nation or culture in your campaign has a Dark Ages flavor
to it, armor heavier than chain mail shouldn&#146;t be available there.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The equipment categories are Stone Age, Bronze Age,
Roman, Dark Ages, Crusades, Renaissance, English Civil War, Middle
Eastern, and Oriental.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The second purpose of this chapter is to update weapon
and armor statistics for the <I>Player&#146;s Option</I> combat
system. In addition to the standard size, type, and damage listings,
a new number has been introduced: the knockdown die. Speed factors
are printed as both a number and a category, for use in a standard
AD&amp;D game or with the <I>Player&#146;s Option</I> initiative
rules. </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="DD02740.htm#9e53bbbc">Partial
armor tables</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> are included, so that
players can re-create historical or fantastic styles such as
back-and-breast plate with greaves, chainmail shirts, and so on.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Last but not least, a complete explanation of special
weapon properties and encumbrance is included at the end of this chapter.</FONT></P>
