This spell clears away weeds, stones, and other debris in a 10-foot-wide path
extending 10 feet in front of the caster. The caster can create a continuous
path for the duration of the spell, clearing a 10-foot-square ahead of him as
long as he continues to move forward. The spell affects jungles, forests, rocky
ground, and snow.
<P></P>
The result of the cleared path is that movement costs are reduced by half.
This is reflected in a reduction of the penalty against movement in rough terrain.
(See Table 74 of the <A HREF="DMG_DD00637.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00637.htm">Dungeon Master's Guide</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>for terrain costs for movement.) For example, if <I>clear path</I> is used in heavy jungle, the movement cost is reduced from 8 to 4. In no case
can <I>clear path</I> reduce movement cost below 1.
<P></P>
<I>Clear path</I> has no effect on rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water, nor does it affect
quicksand, lava, or similar natural obstacles. It also has no effect on
magically-created terrain or manmade barricades.

A priest using the <I>clear path</I> spell can be tracked easily. Tracking proficiency is not required.
<P></P>
The material components are a knife blade and a straw from a broom.
<P></P>
The reverse, <I>clutter path</I>, causes weeds, small stones, and similar debris to litter a 10-foot path
extending 10 feet behind the caster. This hides a trail, making tracking more
difficult. The caster can create a continuous path for the duration of the spell.
The chance to successfully track on a cluttered path is reduced by 50%.
<P></P>
The material components are a handful of pebbles and a handful of weeds.
