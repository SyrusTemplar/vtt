<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> <I>Very smooth</I> surfaces include expanses of smooth, uncracked rock, flush-fitted wooden
walls, and welded or bolted metal walls. Completely smooth walls, unbroken by any
feature, cannot be climbed by anyone without tools.
<P></P>
<I>Smooth and cracked</I> walls include most types of well-built masonry, cavern walls, maintained
castle walls, and slightly eroded cliff faces.
<P></P>
<I>Rough</I> faces are most natural cliffs, poorly maintained or badly built masonry, and
typical wooden walls or stockades. Any natural stone surface is a rough face.
<P></P>
<I>Rough with ledges</I> is similar to rough faces but is dotted with grips three inches or more wide.
Frost-eroded cliffs and natural chimneys are in this category, as are masonry
buildings falling into ruin.
<P></P>
<I>Ice walls</I> are cliffs or faces made entirely of frozen ice. These are different from
very smooth and smooth surfaces in that there are still many natural cracks and
protrusions. They are extremely dangerous to climb, so a Climbing check should be
made every round for any character attempting it without tools.
<P></P>
<I>Trees</I> includes climbs with an open framework, such as a scaffold, as well as trees.
<P></P>
<I>Sloping walls</I> means not quite clifflike but too steep to walk up. If a character falls
while climbing a sloping wall, he suffers damage only if he fails a saving throw
vs. petrification. If the save is made, the character slides a short distance but
is not harmed.
<P></P>
<I>Rope and wall</I> require that the character uses a rope and is able to brace himself against a
solid surface.
