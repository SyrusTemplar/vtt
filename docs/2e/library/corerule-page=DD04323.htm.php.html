This is a simple cooperative magic spell. Only one priest can cast the spell,
but like <I>mystic transfer</I>, another priest is required for the spell to have any effect. Through this
spell, the priest improves the quality of another priest's healing spells.
<P></P>
For the <I>fortify</I> spell to work, it must be cast simultaneously with a <I>cure light wounds, cure serious wounds</I>, or <I>cure critical wounds</I>. The priest casting <I>fortify</I> must lay his hand on the priest attempting the cure. When both spells are
cast, additional energy flows through the second priest and into the creature
being healed. <I>Fortify</I> automatically causes the cure spell to function at maximum effect. Thus, a <I>cure serious wounds</I> would automatically heal 17 points of damage and a <I>cure critical wounds</I> would heal 27 points of damage.
<P></P>
The material component is the priest's holy symbol.
