<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Crucible of Melting:</B> A crucible is a small bowl, usually made of fired clay or porcelain, used for
heating substances to extreme temperatures. The bowl is usually placed on a
furnace. The <I>crucible of melting</I>, however, requires no furnace. It melts any metals placed within it when the
command word is spoken. It takes one turn to bring the crucible to a sufficient
temperature to melt metals placed within it. It has no effect on substances
other than metals.
<P></P>
The average <I>crucible of melting</I> can hold up to one cubic foot of material. Note that magical items are
allowed an item saving throw vs. magical fire to avoid destruction.<I> Crucibles of melting</I> are most often found (when found at all) in the laboratories of wizards,
particularly enchanters who specialize in the construction of magical devices.
<P></P>
Whenever a <I>crucible of melting</I> is used, there is a 5% chance of a mishap resulting in an explosion that
inflicts 3d10 points of damage to all creatures within 10 feet. A save vs. rod,
staff, or wand is allowed, with success indicating half damage. The crucible is
allowed an item saving throw vs. disintegration. If it fails, it is destroyed;
otherwise, it is unharmed and may be used again.
<P></P>
Half of all crucibles remain hot for 3 turns. The rest remain hot until a
command word is spoken to cancel the heat.
