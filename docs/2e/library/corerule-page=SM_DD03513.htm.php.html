Casting Spells For Greater Effect</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">

Another variant rule available with the spell point system is casting spells
for greater than normal effect. By “overcharging” a memorized spell (fixed
magick only) with magical energy, a wizard can achieve results as if he were a
wizard of much higher level. For example, a 2nd-level wizard is normally limited to
a single <I>magic missile </I>when he casts the spell, but with this optional rule he can fire the spell as
a 3rd-level character in order to create two missiles with the spell.
Naturally, the wizard must devote additional spell points to the spell when he memorizes
it. The price is 50% of the spell’s base cost for each additional casting
level stored with the spell.

<I> Rarik is a 4th-level mage who wants to gain the extra damage potential of a
third </I>magic missile <I>when he casts the spell. Normally, a third missile is gained at 5th level, so
Rarik wants to cast the spell as if he were one level higher. A 1st-level spell
requires 4 spell points to memorize, but by spending 6 points (50% more than
4), Rarik gains the ability to cast this one spell as if he were actually 5th
level. All level-based variables are affected, including range, area of effect,
duration, saving throw modifiers, and any other appropriate factors, so Rarik
incidentally gains an additional 10 yards of range with his investment.

Later on in his career, Rarik decides that he’d like a </I>fireball <I>with some extra punch. He’s a 5th-level mage now, and the spell costs him 10
spell points. Rarik spends two 50% increments (a grand total of 20 spell points)
to cast this fireball as if he were a 7th-level caster. The range increases
from 60 to 80 yards, and the damage is 7d6 instead of 5d6.

A character can’t invest more than four additional levels into a spell, which
would triple its cost, increasing it by 200% above the normal price. Most
wizards find that it’s more efficient to gain extra spells rather than overcharge a
single one, but for spells with important breaks in power level based on the
caster’s level—like <I>magic missile</I>—one or two steps of increased casting level may be a good idea.
