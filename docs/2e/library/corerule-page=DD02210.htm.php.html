A <I>divination</I> spell is used to garner a useful piece of advice concerning a specific goal,
event, or activity that will occur within a one-week period. This can be as
simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen.
Unlike the <I>augury</I> spell, this gives a specific piece of advice.
<P></P>
For example, if the question is “Will we do well if we venture to the third
level?” and a terrible troll guarding 10,000 gp and a <I>shield +1</I> lurks near the entrance to the level (the DM estimates the party could beat
the troll after a hard fight), the divination response might be: “Ready oil and
open flame light your way to wealth.” In all cases, the DM controls what
information is received and whether additional divinations will supply additional
information. Note that if the information is not acted upon, the conditions
probably change so that the information is no longer useful (in the example, the
troll might move away and take the treasure with it).
<P></P>
The base chance for a correct divination is 60%, plus 1% for each experience
level of the priest casting the spell. The DM makes adjustments to this base
chance considering the actions being divined (if, for example, unusual precautions
against the spell have been taken). If the dice roll is failed, the caster
knows the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at
work.
<P></P>
The material components of the <I>divination</I> spell are a sacrificial offering, incense, and the holy symbol of the priest.
If an unusually important <I>divination</I> is attempted, sacrifice of particularly valuable gems, jewelry, or magical
items may be required.
