By means of a portal, a magical device or artifact, or divine intervention, an
adventuring party might find themselves on a world where magic does not exist.
Alternately, a player character may find himself transported from a world
where magic is common to a world with no magic. Aside from the PC wizards in the
party, such a world has no wizards at all. There are also no magical items, spell
books, magical monsters, or magical effects of any kind. Such a world will
have a number of interesting ramifications for wizard characters, as well as for
the party as a whole.

How would such a world react to a wizard? As an analogy, imagine how people of
our world would react to the news that an actual wizard walked the planet.
Some would beseech him for favors, while others would seek to exploit him. Some
would see him as a hero, while others would see him as a physical manifestation
of their religious beliefs. Governments might attempt to recruit him as a weapon
against enemies. Scholars might seek to study him. Unsophisticated people,
fearful of his power, might try to capture or kill him.

Obviously, a world without magic is radically different from the typical AD&amp;D®
campaign world, but it can be a refreshing change for the DM and a stimulating
challenge for players with wizard PCs. There are many interesting themes to
explore in this type of campaign world, but the action is also likely to be more
subdued without magical monsters and evil wizards for opponents.
