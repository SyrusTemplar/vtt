<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Animal Empathy:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The character possesses an inherent ability to relate to animals. The
character will generally receive a positive reaction from domesticated animals, and
can soothe the fears of captive wild animals with remarkable consistency. For
example, with a successful Wisdom/Willpower check, the character can encourage a
domesticated animal to approach, or silence a barking watchdog. The character,
as a rule, cannot persuade wild animals to lose their fear of humans. Also, the
trait is useless if the character attempts to deceive an animal into
approaching for the cause of harming it-i.e. the cow won-t be persuaded to walk over to
the fence so that the character can butcher it.
