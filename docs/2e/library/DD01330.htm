</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Conceal: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The spell hides objects or creatures, rendering them undetectable for the
duration of the spell.
<P></P>
At base difficulty (20), the target becomes undetectable to one ordinary sense
for the duration of the spell. The spell's area must be large enough to cover
the entire target, and each multiple to the base difficulty eliminates one
additional sense. Concealment from magical senses, such as ESP and detection
spells, double the difficulty (40). A single type of detection counts as one sense.
For example, a spell that conceals a target from both <I>ESP</I> and magical detection has a difficulty of at least 40. A <I>true seeing</I> spell always defeats a conceal spell, but a target can be warded against
detection.
<P></P>
If a concealed creature makes an attack, the spell is broken unless the
conceal is combined with an imbue with the same duration as the conceal spell-this is
an exception to the general rule about combining spells. Damage from a
successful attack is never concealed, even if the attacker is concealed from the sense
of touch. Magical items that produce visible effects, such as a <I>fireball </I>from a <I>wand of fire</I>, are not concealed along with a creature.

</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Delude: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The spell confounds or distorts the senses, making the target seem like
something else.
<P></P>
At base difficulty (30), one of the target's sensory aspects can be changed
for the duration of the spell. The target does not actually change, but it looks,
feels, smells, sounds, or tastes like something else. Changing the target-s
apparent size more than one category (see <A HREF="DD01333.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01333.htm">Tables 29</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> and <A HREF="DD01334.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01334.htm">30</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) doubles the difficulty, and each additional multiple of difficulty allows
one additional category of change.
<P></P>
Doubling the base difficulty (60) changes the way the target appears to
extraordinary senses such as ESP. For example, making an astral deva seem mindless or
an agitated storm giant appear calm doubles the difficulty. This is in
addition to any multiplier for changing the target's apparent size. For example,
making a 30-foot-tall storm giant look like an unintelligent halfling has a minimum
difficulty of 150.

</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Phantom: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The spell creates a sensory or mental image that can effect any thinking
creature if the creature believes the image.
<P></P>
At base difficulty (40), the image impacts one sense-smell, sound, sight,
taste, or touch-or exists solely as a mental image in the target creature's mind.
Each multiple added to the base difficulty adds one sensory attribute to the
image. If a sensory image is given a mental attribute, the image appears to have
thoughts or emotions. Adding a specific thought or emotion adds 40 to the
difficulty.
<P></P>
If the image's duration is instantaneous, the image lasts only as long as the
caster concentrates. If a duration is specified, the image follows a simple
program of action, as specified by the caster, for the duration of the spell. A
programmed illusion can be made to activate itself in response to a specific
trigger if combined with an imbue spell. A programmed illusion can react logically
any situation it encounters if combined with an imbue spell at triple
difficulty (135).
<P></P>
Unlike a shadow shape, an image cannot inflict real damage, even if the target
believes it is real (see <A HREF="PHB_DD01650.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01650.htm">Player's Handbook</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, Chapter 7).
<P></P>
An image can be used to kill, however, by drawing on the target's fears. Such
images are purely mental and function just like slay spells.

</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Shadow Shape: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The spell allows the user to manipulate material from the Demiplane of Shadow,
creating partially real illusions that retain their effectiveness even if
disbelieved. The caster can employ a shadow shape as a conjure, summon, or strike
spell. A shadow shape's base difficulty is the same as the spell it mimics.
<P></P>
If disbelieved, the shadow shapes retain an Armor Class of 4 and 80% of their
hit points and damage potential. Special attacks, such as petrifaction and
level draining, generally persist for as long as the spell lasts or until dispelled
or disbelieved, but there is a 50% chance that they remain even after the
spell fades.
