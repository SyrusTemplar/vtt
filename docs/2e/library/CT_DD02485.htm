The best attack against a warrior of heroic prowess is often a simple rush.
Overbearing is a common tactic when several creatures are confronting a lone
enemy who can cut them to pieces one at a time. Overbearing attackers throw
themselves at their opponent, using whatever holds they can find to get him on the
ground and restrain him.
<P></P>
Overbearing is hazardous; the defender gets an attack of opportunity against
any attacker he threatens (up to the limits imposed in <A HREF="DD02391.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02391.htm">Chapter One</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">). It can take a concerted rush of a dozen or more to get through a high-level
fighter’s guard. Overbearing is treated as an unarmed attack, and is resolved
on the base initiative of the slowest attacker in the pile.
<P></P>
The overbearing force resolves the attack by making a single attack roll at
the THAC0 of their best member. The attackers get a +1 bonus to hit for each
additional attacker. The attack is made against the defender’s natural Armor Class
(AC 10 for most PCs), only counting magical and Dexterity adjustments—a man in
plate mail is just as vulnerable to being pulled down as a man in leather armor.
<P></P>
If the attackers hit, they must make an opposed Strength check against the
defender to see if they drag him down or not. Use the Strength of the largest
attacker, and apply the following modifiers:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> 4-point bonus or penalty per size difference of the largest attacker versus
the defender;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> +1 per additional attacker;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> –4 if defender has more than two legs.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Monsters can be assumed to have a Strength of 31/2 points per size category (3
for Tiny, 7 for Small, 10 for Man-sized, 14 for Large, etc.) plus their Hit
Dice. If the defender wins the Strength check, he keeps his feet and shrugs off
the attack. If the attackers win, the defender is knocked down. The defender can
be pinned and restrained if he is successfully overborne again in the next
round.

<I>For example, six kobolds are fighting Alvoth, a human knight. The monsters
decide to use their numbers against Alvoth and overbear him. Alvoth kills one of
the kobolds in an attack of opportunity as the monsters close, but the other
five try to overbear anyway. Alvoth is normally AC 0, but his chain mail and
shield don’t help him here, only his Dexterity of 18. The kobolds attack against an
AC of 6, with a +1 bonus to hit since they outnumber him.
<P></P>
The kobolds score a hit, so Alvoth engages in a Strength contest to keep his
feet. Kobolds should have a Strength score of 7 based on the formula above
(31/2¥2 for Small). However, their effective Strength is increased to an 11 due to
their numbers (4 extra kobolds). Alvoth has a Strength of 17 and rolls a 9,
making his Strength check. The kobolds roll an 11, just making their check with a
higher roll and winning the contest. Alvoth goes down beneath the brutes’ rush.

As an option, a saving throw vs. paralyzation can be substituted for the
opposed Strength checks. This works a little faster, but it’s not as accurate as the
system described above.
