<FONT SIZE="3"><I>I shall laugh as I place my head on the block,
laugh at them all as the raven jeers at the gallows or the worm mocks
the grave. It took the Prince&#146;s most powerful knights to bring
me&#151;shackled in cold iron&#151;before my earthly liege, but not
before I had slain a hundred of his retainers, twisted the insides of
his beloved wife, cursed their only son with ravening madness eternal.</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>I have lain among the rat-gnawed bones of the
oubliette and accepted the iron maiden&#146;s cruel embrace, but I am
not alone, and I feel no pain. The slaadi still comfort me with their
infernal melodies, and my invisible familiars still inform me,
bringing news in the clammy darkness from my lord Thasmudyan. I shall
have eternal life for my devoted service; the baatezu lord has
promised me this final boon.</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>I will survive, of that I am certain, but my next
evolution may not remember all of my secrets, all the cryptic
mysteries of the Art. I shall bid the shadows to write them down,
inscribe them in a book so that I may remember all that I knew before
I died. And then I shall depart this earthly realm and walk on
farther shores, undreaming and unbidden, until I stand once again in
the ivory court of Thasmudyan.</I></FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The human mind and personality yearns to persist after
death. Most turn to religion for the promise of eternal life, but
other individuals&#151;less trusting in divine providence or perhaps
fearing their spirit&#146;s ultimate destiny in the
afterlife&#151;take it upon themselves to secure their own
immortality in the physical world. Most necromancers eventually
master the secret talents necessary to achieve this goal. Indeed,
some embrace the Art solely for this purpose.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Aging is a natural process for all, but to the
necromancer, both powerful magic and the curse of the Black Arts can
quickly strip the wizard of fleeting youth. Although age initially
matures a wizard&#146;s mental faculties, senility and decrepitude
eventually corrupt both mind and body. A wizard can allay or avoid
these disabilities through potions, wishes, or necromancy.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>Potions of longevity</I> and <I>elixirs of youth</I>
are perhaps the most common method for extending life, though their
rare material components make mass production highly infeasible. In
addition to their costly mundane components, the formulae for these
potions is rumored to include either the dust of a lich, a
dragon&#146;s breath, an angel&#146;s whisper, or the blood of an
elf, freely given. Not surprisingly, few wizards can obtain or create
more than a few of these potions, usually extending their normal life
span by several decades. However, even if an unlimited supply of such
potions were available, the increasing chance of completely reversing
their effects (1% cumulative per potion) drastically limits their
ultimate usefulness. At best, a wizard might hope to extend his or
her lifetime by three to four centuries with such potions.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Powerful spells, such <I>as limited wish</I> or <I>wish</I>,
can also prolong life. Although each DM must adjudicate the specific
powers of a <I>wish</I> for the campaign, it is not unreasonable to
assume such magic could slow aging by a factor of 10. A <I>wish</I>
irreversibly ages the caster by five years, and it cannot be used to
negate its own life-draining effects. A 40-year old wizard who <I>wishes</I>
for an extended life span still ages to 45 years before the <I>wish</I>
takes hold. Still, with intelligent use of a few<I> wishes</I>, an
archmage might prolong his or her life beyond a millennium.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">There are other ways to extend human life, known only
to the powerful necromancer. The new spells <I>life force transfer</I>
and <I>life force exchange</I> enable the wizard to permanently
transfer his or her own life force into the body of another
(presumably much younger) individual. <I>Magic jar</I> works along
the same premise, though the effects are only temporary. In all of
these cases, the necromancer achieves youth only at the expense of
another individual. With <I>life force transfer</I>, the victim dies
when the spirit is literally forced out of the body to make room for
the caster&#146;s life force; with <I>life force exchange</I>, the
spirits of the caster and victim swap bodies; with <I>magic jar</I>,
the wizard and victim share the same body (albeit temporarily). While
each of these spells carries its own dangers (see the spell
descriptions in this book and the </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="PHB_DD02314.htm">PHB</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">),
they can also provide an unusual form of human immortality for the
necromancer. Unlike other methods, which only ensure prolonged life,
these spells enable an evil wizard to also enjoy all the pleasures
and benefits of eternal youth.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">A necromancer can thus effectively extend his or her
mortal lifetime almost indefinitely&#151;certainly far beyond the
range of normal humans&#151;through potions, the intelligent casting
of <I>wishes</I>, or by the unscrupulous use of the Art. However, a
wizard can also resort to a permanent undying transition in order to
achieve some measure of immortality.</FONT></P>
