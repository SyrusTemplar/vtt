It is useful to have a few pre-rolled characters on hand. These should be of
several different levels and classes, with equipment and personality quirks
noted. These &quot;instant&quot; player characters can be used by guest players (those only
able to play in a few sessions) and by regular players whose characters have
died during the course of a session.
<P></P>
When the latter occurs, introduce the new character at an appropriate point
and then allow the player to control it for the rest of the evening. This keeps
that player from being bored. If the player enjoys the character (and you are
pleased with the arrangement), you can allow him to continue playing that
character in future sessions.
