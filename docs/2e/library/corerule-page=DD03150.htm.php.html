<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Weapon Group Proficiencies</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> By spending 2 proficiency slots (4 character points), a warrior can gain a
proficiency in all the weapons in a specific tight group. If that tight group is
part of a broad group, then the character also possesses weapon familiarity
with all weapons in the broad group.
<P></P>
By spending 3 slots (6 character points), a warrior can learn a broad group
weapon proficiency. He is assumed to be fully proficient in every weapon in that
broad group.
<P></P>
This group proficiency option is only available to warriors. All other
characters must spend a single proficiency slot to become proficient with a specific
type of weapon.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Weapon proficiency slots can be spent to gain several types of bonuses that
are not, technically, “weapon proficiencies.” These are all relevant to combat
situations, however, and improve the character’s chances to defend or to attack
effectively—both with and without a weapon.
