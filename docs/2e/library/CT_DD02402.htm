The last step before starting the fight is setting up the battlefield and the
location of the combatants. The DM should first arrange the battlefield; if the
fight is taking place in a room inside a dungeon, the DM notes the room’s
size, shape, and interesting contents before placing any creatures in it. <A HREF="DD02521.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02521.htm">Chapter Three</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> describes battlefields of all kinds in great detail.

If one side has spotted the other without being seen, or has surprised the
other group, they can make their opponents set up first and then place their own
combatants to take advantage of the situation. (They still have to observe the
encounter distance dictated by the DM, though.)
<P></P>
If neither side is surprised, or if other special circumstances exist, the DM
can dictate the positions of all characters and monsters at the beginning of
the battle. The PCs should be set up in their normal marching order, with any
adjustments the DM deems appropriate. Someone had to open the door to the
guardroom, after all. The monsters are placed by the DM as she sees fit.

If the DM knows something the players don’t, there’s no reason she can’t keep
some figures off the map until the players have reason to spot them. If there’s
a giant spider on the ceiling and no one looks up, the DM should feel free to
spring a fiendish surprise when a character walks under it.
