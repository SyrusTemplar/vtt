The latest time period that should be considered as a setting for a normal
AD&amp;D campaign, the Renaissance was a time of great change. The collapse of the
feudal system had begun throughout much of Europe. There was great growth in
literature, art, and science. The power of the old nobility began to decline while
the influence and wealth of merchants and businessmen continued to grow.
Gunpowder and simple guns revolutionized the face of warfare. Foot soldiers became
more important than cavalry, and armor was not nearly as useful as it once had
been.
