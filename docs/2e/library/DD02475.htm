Since the members of the wall are in close order, shield walls allow them to
concentrate their fighting power. They are also good for controling enemy
movement, especially in narrow areas such as dungeon corridors. Because the shields
overlap, all members of the wall gain a ?1 bonus to their Armor Class.

Creatures forming a shield wall must be of the same size or the wall won?t
work. In addition, they have to move together if they want to stay linked. A
shield wall can only take a half-move without breaking apart.

Creatures in a shield wall are slightly limited in their choice of armament.
They can fight only with one-handed weapons since they?re using a shield in the
other hand. If they use a slashing or bludgeoning (Type S or B) weapon, they
suffer a ?2 penalty to attack rolls unless the weapon is a smaller size category
than they are, because the close order interferes with the weapon?s swing.
Piercing (Type P) weapons aren?t affected by close order.

<I>As an example, a human barbarian (size M) forms a shield wall with his
companions. He can use his short sword (Type S, size S) or spear (Type P, size M)
without penalty, but if he fights with his battle axe (Type S, size M) he suffers a
?2 penalty to his attack rolls because he?s so close to his allies.

Another excellent tactic for shield walls is to place long-range polearm
wielders immediately behind the shield wall. Since the polearms can reach over the
shield line, enemies can be exposed to several attacks at once when they close
to melee range. Using a polearm over a friend creates a ?2 penalty to attack
rolls, however.
