<FONT SIZE="3">With this abjuration spell, the wizard provides a
protective barrier similar to that created by the spells <I>protection
from evil </I>or <I>protection from vermin</I>, warding the
recipient against creatures that possess venom or poison of some
kind. Poisonous monsters or poison-using characters of 4 or less Hit
Dice or levels are prevented from making physical contact with the
spell recipient, while venomous creatures of 4+1 Hit Dice or
poison-using characters of five levels or more suffer a &#150;2
penalty on their attack rolls against the protected character. Only
injected or contact poisons from natural or innate sources (such as
compounds made from plants or the venom from a snake) in a position
to possibly injure the character are protected against; a thief
carrying a vial of ingestive poison in his pouch is not counted as a
venomous character while a character that is brandishing a poisoned
short sword is counted as venomous. The spell recipient can still be
poisoned by a spitting attack or a thrown dagger smeared with poison.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">If the spell recipient attacks a creature he has been
warded against or uses the resistance of the spell&#146;s aura to
force his antagonist to give ground, the spell ends. Regrettably,
reaching out to drink from a poisoned cup dispels the effect, so this
spell offers no protection against ingested poisons. The spell
functions normally if cast upon a poison-using creature or character.</FONT></P>
