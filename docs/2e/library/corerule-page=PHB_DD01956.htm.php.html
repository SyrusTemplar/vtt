This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the
caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell effects from penetrating
(i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the
minor globe of invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects
from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical globe, and
these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the
globe. Fourth and higher level spells are not affected by the globe. The globe
can be brought down by a successful <I>dispel magic</I> spell. The caster can leave and return to the globe without penalty. Note
that spell effects are not actually disrupted by the globe unless cast directly
through or into it: The caster would still see a mirror image created by a wizard
outside the globe. If that wizard then entered the globe, the images would
wink out, to reappear when the wizard exited the globe. Likewise, a wizard
standing in the area of a <I>light</I> spell would still receive sufficient light for vision, even though that part
of the <I>light</I> spell volume in the globe would not be luminous.

The material component of the spell is a glass or crystal bead that shatters
at the expiration of the spell.
