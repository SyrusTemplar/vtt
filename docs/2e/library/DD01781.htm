<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The chance of success of a climb is calculated by taking the character's skill
level (given as a percentage) and modifying it for his race, the condition of
the surface, and situational modifiers. <A HREF="DD01783.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01783.htm">Table 65</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> lists the percentages for the different categories of climbers.
<P></P>
The chance of success given in Table 65 is modified by many factors. Some of
these remain the same from climb to climb (such as a character's race) and can
be figured into the character's base score. Others depend on the conditions of a
given climb. All factors are listed on <A HREF="DD01782.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01782.htm">Table 66</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
The final result of Tables 65 and 66 is the number the character uses for
Climbing checks. A Climbing check is made by rolling percentile dice. If the number
rolled is equal to or less than the number found from Tables 65 and 66, the
character succeeds with the Climbing check. Rolls above this number indicate
failure.
<P></P>
A Climbing check must be made any time a character tries to climb a height of
10 feet or more. This check is made before the character ascends the first 10
feet of the climb. If the check is passed, the character can continue climbing.
If the check is failed, the character is unable to find a route and cannot even
attempt the climb. No further attempts can be made by that character until a
change occurs. This is either a significant change in location (a half mile or
more along the face of a cliff) or an improvement in the character's chance of
success.

For example, Brondvrouw the gnome is an unskilled climber. Her normal chance
of success is 25% (40%--15% for being a gnome). She has been cut off from the
rest of the party by a rugged cliff, 50 feet high. Fortunately, the cliff is dry
and the rock seems solid. She makes an attempt, but rolls a 49 on the
percentile dice. She cannot limb the cliff. Then one of her friends above remembers to
lower a rope. With the rope, Brondvrouw can again try the climb, since her
percentage chance is now 80%. This time, she rolls a 27 and makes the ascent.

On particularly long climbs--those greater than 100 feet or requiring more
than one turn (10 minutes) of climbing time--the DM may require additional checks.
The frequency of these checks is for the DM to decide. Characters who fail a
check could fall a very long way, so it is wise to carry ropes and tools.
