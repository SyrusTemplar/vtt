<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Foreword
to the 2nd Edition</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It has been a long time
getting here. I don't mean the months, perhaps even years, you may
have waited for a revised, expanded, and improved edition of the AD&amp;D
game. I mean the long time it has taken me to reach this point, the
writing of the foreword. Forewords are written last, so that you can
summarize your feelings and experiences about the book you have
written.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It's not accurate to say this
is a book that I alone have written. First off, there are a lot of
other names listed in the credits. They, especially the editors,
contributed time and talents that I don't have. Improving the
organization and readability was one of the reasons we started this
project in the first place. These are tasks that can't be done
without talented editors who play and care about the game. If you
discover that it's easier to find rules during your gaming sessions
and that everything seems to make more sense, thank the editors.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even with the editors, this
is not our work alone. None of this would ever have come into being
without interested and involved players. The people who really
decided what needed to be done for the AD&amp;D 2nd Edition game are
the players who mailed in questions, everyone who wrote an article
for DRAGON</font><sup><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">®</font></sup><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
Magazine, and everyone who button-holed me (or other designers) at
conventions. These were the people who decided what needed to be
done, what needed fixing, what was unclear, and what they just didn't
like. I didn't sit in a vacuum and make these decisions. As the
designer and developer, I had to make the final choice, but those
choices were based on your input. And your input is the most valuable
asset we have going.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So how do I feel? Excited,
exhausted, relieved, and nervous -- all at once. It's a great bag of
emotions. I'm excited to see this book come out. I've spent more time
on this than I have on any other single work I've done. That leads to
exhaustion. The AD&amp;D 2nd Edition game has demanded and received
hours upon months of attention. Now that it is finally coming out,
the feeling of relief is beginning to set in. There were times when
the task looked impossible, when it seemed it would never end, or
when everything was going wrong. Only now, when it's in the final
stages of polishing, am I beginning to realize that it is really
done. And of course there is the nervousness. The AD&amp;D game is
the granddaddy of all role-playing games. You've made it perfectly
clear that you liked the original edition of the AD&amp;D game, even
with all its warts. I liked (and still like) it. So, now with the
arrival of AD&amp;D 2nd Edition, of course I'm nervous.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	None of this comes as any
surprise. I volunteered to prepare this Edition because I wanted to
do something for the game I liked. The ten years of experience I've
had in game design has shown me what works and what doesn't and
sometimes even why. At the very start, we outlined the goals: to make
it easier to find things, to make the rules easier to understand, to
fix the things that did not work, to add the best new ideas from the
expansions and other sources, and, most important of all, to make
sure the game was still the one you knew and enjoyed. Of them all,
the last was the hardest and most demanding, conflicting as it did
with my basic desire to design things. Fortunately, things didn't
rest on me alone. Lots of eager eyes, from those of fellow designers
to those of enthusiastic playtesters, minutely examined this book and
restrained me from overzealousness. It hasn't always been easy to
walk the fine line between &quot;not enough&quot; and &quot;too
much.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In the past two years, I've
talked to interested players many times, hearing their concerns and
sharing my ideas. It was at the end of one of these talks (at a
convention in Missoula, Montana), just as I described some rules
change, that one of the listeners smiled and said, &quot;You know,
we've been doing that for years.&quot; And that is what AD&amp;D 2nd
Edition is all about--collecting and organizing all those things that
we, as players, have been doing for years.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Before we even start, I want
to make sure everyone understands one very important fact:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" align="center" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">This is
not AD&amp;D 3rd Edition!</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There, everyone can breathe
again.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Rest assured that this is
still the same version of the AD&amp;D game that your friends,
classmates, and business partners have been playing for years.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yes, there are some small and
subtle changes in the rules, but you would have to read the whole
book very carefully, and have a tremendous memory, to find them. (The
changes are the sorts of minor corrections and clarifications we make
every time we reprint, and we've reprinted both the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Player's
Handbook</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> and
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Dungeon Master Guide</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
more than 10 times since 1989!)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So what has changed?
Obviously, the books look different. We were awfully proud of them
when they were released in 1989, but the world doesn't stand still
for anyone. We decided that after six years, it was time for a new
look.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And as long as AD&amp;D was
getting a new suit of clothes, we elected to let out the seams a bit,
too. Both books are a lot bigger: 25% more pages in the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>PHB</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
33% more in the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>DMG</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
And we used them up just looking good. Inside you'll find bigger
illustrations, lots more color, and pages that are easy to read.
Making the switch turned out to be a lot more work than most of us
expected it to be, but it was well worth the effort.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Since the 2nd Edition was
released, the AD&amp;D game has grown in ways we never anticipated.
We've traveled to a multitude of fabulous worlds, from the misty
horror of Ravenloft, to the exotic bazaars of Al Qadim, and across
the burning face of Dark Sun. Now the endless horizons of Planescape
beckon to us, and beyond even that we see spearpoints and banners
waving above the gathering armies of Birthright. And, of course,
presiding over it all is the grand and legendary Forgotten Realms.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Products change, but our goal
stays the same: to publish things that make fantasy gamers exclaim,
&quot;That's just what I was looking for!&quot; And we do it for the
same reason that you play: because it's fun!</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">You are reading the key to the
most exciting hobby in the world -- role-playing games.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	These first few pages will
introduce you to the second edition of the most successful
role-playing game ever published. If you are a novice role-player,
stop right here and read the section labeled </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>The
Real Basics</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> (on the
next page). When you understand what role-playing and the AD&amp;D
game are all about, come back to this point and read the rest of the
introduction. If you are an experienced role-player, skip </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>The

<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>How
the Rule Books are Organized </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The AD&amp;D game rule books
are intended primarily as reference books. They are designed so any
specific rule can be found quickly and easily during a game.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Everything a player needs to
know is in the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Player's
Handbook.</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> That's
not to say that all the rules are in this book. But every rule that a
player needs to know in order to play the game is in this book.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A few rules have been
reserved for the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Dungeon
Master® Guide</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
(DMG). These either cover situations that very seldom arise or give
the Dungeon Master (DM) information that players should not have
beforehand. Everything else in the DMG is information that only the
Dungeon Master needs. If the DM feels that players need to know
something that is explained in the DMG, he will tell them.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Like the DMG, the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Monstrous
Manual™</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
supplement is the province of the DM. This gives complete and
detailed information about the monsters, people, and other creatures
inhabiting the AD&amp;D world. Some DMs don't mind if players read
this information, but the game is more fun if players don't know
everything about their foes -- it heightens the sense of discovery
and danger of the unknown.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Learning
the Game </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If you have played the AD&amp;D
game before, you know almost everything you need to play the 2nd
Edition. We advise you to read the entire </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Player's
Handbook,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> but the
biggest changes are in these chapters: Character Classes, Combat, and
Experience. Be sure to read at least those three chapters before
sitting down to play.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If you come to a term you do
not understand, look for it in the Glossary.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If you have never played the
AD&amp;D game before, the best way to learn to play the game is to
find a group of experienced players and join them. They can get you
immediately into the game and explain things as you need to know
them. You don't need to read anything beforehand. In fact, it's best
if you can play the game for several hours with experienced players
before reading any of the rules. One of the amazing things about a
role-playing game is that the concept is difficult to explain, but
marvelously simple to demonstrate.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If none of your friends are
involved in a game, the best place to find experienced players is
through your local hobby store. Role-playing and general gaming clubs
are common and are always eager to accept new members. Many hobby
stores offer a bulletin board through which DMs can advertise for new
players and new players can ask for information about new or ongoing
games. If there is no hobby store in your area, check at the local
library or school.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If you can't find anyone else
who knows the AD&amp;D game, you can teach yourself. Read the
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Player's Handbook</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
and create some characters. Try to create a variety of character
classes. Then pick up a pre-packaged adventure module for low-level
characters, round up two or three friends, and dive into it. You
probably will make lots of mistakes and wonder constantly whether you
are doing everything wrong. Even if you are, don't worry about it.
The AD&amp;D game is big, but eventually you'll bring it under
control.</font></p>

you need to about role-playing, but you will need to adjust to doing
certain things different ways.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Much of the jargon of the two
games is very similar. Don't let this mislead you into thinking that
they are the same game. There are many subtle differences (along with
some obvious ones), and you will need to read the rules in this book
carefully to catch them all.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Pay special attention to the
chapters on PC races and classes, alignment, weapons and armor, and
spell descriptions. The terminology of both games is quite similar,
sometimes identical, when discussing these rules. These similarities
often hide important differences between the way the rules work or
how the numbers line up.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Overall, it is best to
approach the AD&amp;D game as if it is a completely new game and be
pleasantly surprised when you find overlapping concepts. Don't make
the mistake of assuming that a rule, item, or spell with the same
name in both games works the same way in both games.</font></p>

it is clear, concise, and familiar. Nothing else is.</font></p>

<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This section is intended for
novice role-players. If you have played role-playing games before,
don't be surprised if what you read here sounds familiar.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Games come in a wide
assortment of types: board games, card games, word games, picture
games, miniatures games. Even within these categories are
subcategories. Board games, for example, can be divided into path
games, real estate games, military simulation games, abstract
strategy games, mystery games, and a host of others.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Still, in all this mass of
games, role-playing games are unique. They form a category all their
own that doesn't overlap any other category.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For that reason, role-playing
games are hard to describe. Comparisons don't work because there
isn't anything similar to compare them to. At least, not without
stretching your imagination well beyond its normal, everyday
extension.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But then, stretching your
imagination is what role-playing is all about. So let's try an
analogy.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Imagine that you are playing
a simple board game, called Snakes and Ladders. Your goal is to get
from the bottom to the top of the board before all the other players.
Along the way are traps that can send you sliding back toward your
starting position. There are also ladders that can let you jump
ahead, closer to the finish space. So far, it's pretty simple and
pretty standard.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now let's change a few
things. Instead of a flat, featureless board with a path winding from
side to side, let's have a maze. You are standing at the entrance,
and you know that there's an exit somewhere, but you don't know
where. You have to find it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Instead of snakes and
ladders, we'll put in hidden doors and secret passages. Don't roll a
die to see how far you move; you can move as far as you want. Move
down the corridor to the intersection. You can turn right, or left,
or go straight ahead, or go back the way you came. Or, as long as
you're here, you can look for a hidden door. If you find one, it will
open into another stretch of corridor. That corridor might take you
straight to the exit or lead you into a blind alley. The only way to
find out is to step in and start walking.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of course, given enough time,
eventually you'll find the exit. To keep the game interesting, let's
put some other things in the maze with you. Nasty things. Things like
vampire bats and hobgoblins and zombies and ogres. Of course, we'll
give you a sword and a shield, so if you meet one of these things you
can defend yourself. You do know how to use a sword, don't you?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And there are other players
in the maze as well. They have swords and shields, too. How do you
suppose another player would react if you chance to meet? He might
attack, but he also might offer to team up. After all, even an ogre
might think twice about attacking two people carrying sharp swords
and stout shields.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, let's put the board
somewhere you can't see it. Let's give it to one of the players and
make that player the referee. Instead of looking at the board, you
listen to the referee as he describes what you can see from your
position on the board. You tell the referee what you want to do and
he moves your piece accordingly. As the referee describes your
surroundings, try to picture them mentally. Close your eyes and
construct the walls of the maze around yourself. Imagine the
hobgoblin as the referee describes it whooping and gamboling down the
corridor toward you. Now imagine how you would react in that
situation and tell the referee what you are going to do about it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	We have just constructed a
simple role-playing game. It is not a sophisticated game, but it has
the essential element that makes a role-playing game: The player is
placed in the midst of an unknown or dangerous situation created by a
referee and must work his way through it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This is the heart of
role-playing. The player adopts the role of a character and then
guides that character through an adventure. The player makes
decisions, interacts with other characters and players, and,
essentially, &quot;pretends&quot; to be his character during the
course of the game. That doesn't mean that the player must jump up
and down, dash around, and act like his character. It means that
whenever the character is called on to do something or make a
decision, the player pretends that he is in that situation and
chooses an appropriate course of action.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Physically, the players and
referee (the DM) should be seated comfortably around a table with the
referee at the head. Players need plenty of room for papers, pencils,
dice, rule books, drinks, and snacks. The referee needs extra space
for his maps, dice, rule books, and assorted notes.</font></p>

<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>The
Goal </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Another major difference
between role-playing games and other games is the ultimate goal.
Everyone assumes that a game must have a beginning and an end and
that the end comes when someone wins. That doesn't apply to
role-playing because no one &quot;wins&quot; in a role-playing game.
The point of playing is not to win but to have fun and to socialize.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	An adventure usually has a
goal of some sort: protect the villagers from the monsters; rescue
the lost princess; explore the ancient ruins. Typically, this goal
can be attained in a reasonable playing time: four to eight hours is
standard. This might require the players to get together for one,
two, or even three playing sessions to reach their goal and complete
the adventure.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But the game doesn't end when
an adventure is finished. The same characters can go on to new
adventures. Such a series of adventures is called a campaign.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Remember, the point of an
adventure is not to win but to have fun while working toward a common
goal. But the length of any particular adventure need not impose an
artificial limit on the length of the game. The AD&amp;D game
embraces more than enough adventure to keep a group of characters
occupied for years.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Required
Materials </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Aside from a copy of this
book, very little is needed to play the AD&amp;D game.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	You will need some sort of
character record. TSR publishes character record sheets that are
quite handy and easy to use, but any sheet of paper will do. Blank
paper, lined paper, or even graph paper can be used. A double-sized
sheet of paper (11 × 17 inches), folded in half, is excellent. Keep
your character record in pencil, because it will change frequently
during the game. A good eraser is also a must.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A full set of polyhedral dice
is necessary. A full set consists of 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, 12-, and
20-sided dice. A few extra 6- and 10-sided dice are a good idea.
Polyhedral dice should be available wherever you got this book.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Throughout these rules, the
various dice are referred to by a code that is in the form: # of
dice, followed by &quot;d,&quot; followed by a numeral for the type
of dice. In other words, if you are to roll one 6-sided die, you
would see &quot;roll 1d6.&quot; Five 12-sided dice are referred to as
&quot;5d12.&quot; (If you don't have five 12-sided dice, just roll
one five times and add the results.)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When the rules say to roll
&quot;percentile dice&quot; or &quot;d100,&quot; you need to generate
a random number from 1 to 100. One way to do this is to roll two
10-sided dice of different colors. Before you roll, designate one die
as the tens place and the other as the ones place. Rolling them
together enables you to generate a number from 1 to 100 (a result of
&quot;0&quot; on both dice is read as &quot;00&quot; or &quot;100&quot;).
For example, if the blue die (representing the tens place) rolls an
&quot;8&quot; and the red die (ones place) rolls a &quot;5,&quot; the
result is 85. Another, more expensive, way to generate a number from
1 to 100 is to buy one of the dice that actually have numbers from 1
to 100 on them.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At least one player should
have a few sheets of graph paper for mapping the group's progress.
Assorted pieces of scratch paper are handy for making quick notes,
for passing secret messages to other players or the DM, or for
keeping track of odd bits of information that you don't want
cluttering up your character record.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Miniature figures are handy
for keeping track of where everyone is in a confusing situation like
a battle. These can be as elaborate or simple as you like. Some
players use miniature lead or pewter figures painted to resemble
their characters. Plastic soldiers, chess pieces, boardgame pawns,
dice, or bits of paper can work just as well.</font></p>

Example of Play </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">To further clarify what really
goes on during an AD&amp;D game, read the following example. This is
typical of the sort of action that occurs during a playing session.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shortly before this example
begins, three player characters fought a skirmish with a wererat (a
creature similar to a werewolf but which becomes an enormous rat
instead of a wolf). The wererat was wounded and fled down a tunnel.
The characters are in pursuit. The group includes two fighters and a
cleric. Fighter 1 is the group's leader.</font></p>

pick the best score from each pair, generally ensuring that your
character does not have any really low ability scores (but low
ability scores are not all that bad any way!).</font></p>

score of 8. Then roll seven dice. These dice can be added to your
character's abilities as you wish. All the points on a die must be
added to the same ability score. For example, if a 6 is rolled on one
die, all 6 points must be assigned to one ability. You can add as
many dice as you want to any ability, but no ability score can exceed
18 points. If you cannot make an 18 by exact count on the dice, you

</font></font>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Strength (Str) measures a
character's muscle, endurance, and stamina. This ability is the prime
requisite of warriors because they must be physically powerful in
order to wear armor and wield heavy weapons. A fighter with a score
of 16 or more in Strength gains a 10% bonus to the experience points
he earns.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, any warrior with
a Strength score of 18 is entitled to roll percentile dice (see
Glossary) to determine exceptional Strength; exceptional Strength
improves the character's chance to hit an enemy, increases the damage
he causes with each hit, increases the weight the character is able
to carry without a penalty for encumbrance (see below), and increases
the character's ability to force open doors and similar portals.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The rest of this section on
Strength consists of explanations of the columns in Table 1. Refer to

rolled to determine the damage caused by an attack (regardless of
subtractions, a successful attack roll can never cause less than 1
point of damage). For example, a short sword normally causes 1d6
points of damage (a range of 1 to 6). An attacker with Strength 17
causes one extra point of damage, for a range of 2 to 7 points of
damage. The damage adjustment also applies to missile weapons,
although bows must be specially made to gain the bonus; crossbows
never benefit from the user's Strength.</font></p>

several physical attributes including hand-eye coordination, agility,
reaction speed, reflexes, and balance. Dexterity affects a
character's reaction to a threat or surprise, his accuracy with
thrown weapons and bows, and his ability to dodge an enemy's blows.
It is the prime requisite of rogues and affects their professional

dodge normal missiles and parry weapon thrusts. For example, Rath is
wearing chain mail, giving him an Armor Class of 5. If his Dexterity
score is 16, his Armor Class is modified by -2 to 3, making him
harder to hit. If his Dexterity score is 5, his Armor Class is
modified by +2 to 7, making him easier to hit. (In some situations,
beneficial Dexterity modifiers to Armor Class do not apply. Usually
this occurs when a character is attacked from behind or when his
movement is restricted--attacked while prone, tied up, on a ledge,
climbing a rope, etc.)</font></p>

</font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A character's Constitution
(Con) score encompasses his physique, fitness, health, and physical
resistance to hardship, injury, and disease. Since this ability
affects the character's hit points and chances of surviving such
tremendous shocks as being physically reshaped by magic or
resurrected from death, it is vitally important to all classes. Some
classes have minimum allowable Constitution scores.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A character's initial
Constitution score is the absolute limit to the number of times the
character can be raised or resurrected from death. Each such revival
reduces the character's Constitution score by one. Magic can restore
a reduced Constitution score to its original value or even higher,
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>but this has no
effect on the number of times a character can be revived from death!</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
Once the character has exhausted his original Constitution, nothing
short of divine intervention can bring him back, and divine
intervention is reserved for only the bravest and most faithful
heroes!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, Rath's
Constitution score at the start of his adventuring career is 12. He
can be revived from death 12 times. If he dies a 13th time, he cannot
be </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>resurrected</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">is added to or
subtracted from each Hit Die rolled for the character. However, no
Hit Die ever yields less than 1 hit point, regardless of
modifications. If an adjustment would lower the number rolled to 0 or
less, consider the final result to be 1. Always use the character's
current Constitution to determine hit point bonuses and penalties.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Only warriors are entitled to
a Constitution bonus of +3 or +4. Non-warrior characters who have
Constitution scores of 17 or 18 receive only +2 per die.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The Constitution bonus ends
when a character reaches 10th level (9th for warriors and
priests)--neither the Constitution bonus nor Hit Dice are added to a
character's hit points after he has passed this level (see the
character class descriptions in Chapter 3).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a character's Constitution
changes during the course of adventuring, his hit points may be
adjusted up or down to reflect the change. The difference between the
character's current hit point bonus (if any) and the new bonus is
multiplied by the character's level (up to 10) and added to or
subtracted from the character's total. If Delsenora's Constitution
increased from 16 to 17, she would gain 1 hit point for every level
she had, up to 10th level.</font></p>

crow. The hireling, whose Constitution score is 13, has an 85% chance

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Intelligence (Int) represents
a character's memory, reasoning, and learning ability, including
areas outside those measured by the written word. Intelligence
dictates the number of languages a character can learn. Intelligence
is the prime requisite of wizards, who must have keen minds to
understand and memorize magical spells. A wizard with an Intelligence
score of 16 or higher gains a 10% bonus to experience points earned.
The wizard's Intelligence dictates which spells he can learn and the
number of spells he can memorize at one time. Only those of the
highest Intelligence can comprehend the mighty magic of 9th-level
spells.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This ability gives only a
general indication of a character's mental acuity. A semi-intelligent
character (Int 3 or 4) can speak (with difficulty) and is apt to
react instinctively and impulsively. He is not hopeless as a player
character (PC), but playing such a character correctly is not easy. A
character with low Intelligence (Int 5-7) could also be called
dull-witted or slow. A very intelligent person (Int 11 or 12) picks
up new ideas quickly and learns easily. A highly intelligent
character (Int 13 or 14) is one who can solve most problems without
even trying very hard. One with exceptional intelligence (Int 15 or
16) is noticeably above the norm. A genius character is brilliant
(Int 17 or 18). A character beyond genius is potentially more clever
and more brilliant than can possibly be imagined.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, the true
capabilities of a mind lie not in numbers--I.Q., Intelligence score,

if your character begins the game already knowing these additional

communication easier, while the second increases your opportunities
for role-playing (finding a tutor or creating a reason why you need

a 3rd-level spell she has never seen before! Excited, she sits down

the Numbers Mean </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Now that you have finished
creating the ability scores for your character, stop and take a look
at them. What does all this mean?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suppose you decide to name
your character &quot;Rath&quot; and you rolled the following ability
scores for him:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Strength	8</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Dexterity	14</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Constitution	13</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Intelligence	13</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Wisdom	7</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Charisma	6</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Rath has strengths and
weaknesses, but it is up to you to interpret what the numbers mean.
Here are just two different ways these numbers could be interpreted.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	1) Although Rath is in good
health (Con 13), he's not very strong (Str 8) because he's just plain
lazy--he never wanted to exercise as a youth and now it's too late.
His low Wisdom and Charisma scores (7, 6) show that he lacks the
common sense to apply himself properly and projects a slothful, &quot;I'm
not going to bother&quot; attitude (which tends to irritate others).
Fortunately, Rath's natural wit (Int 13) and Dexterity (14) keep him
from being a total loss.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thus, you might play Rath as
an irritating, smart-alecky twerp forever ducking just out of range
of those who want to squash him.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	2) Rath has several good
points--he has studied hard (Int 13) and practiced his manual skills
(Dex 14). Unfortunately, his Strength is low (8) from a lack of
exercise (all those hours spent reading books). Despite that, Rath's
health is still good (Con 13). His low Wisdom and Charisma (7, 6) are
a result of his lack of contact and involvement with people outside
the realm of academics.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Looking at the scores this
way, you could play Rath as a kindly, naive, and shy professorial
type who's a good tinkerer, always fiddling with new ideas and
inventions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Obviously, Rath's ability
scores (often called &quot;stats&quot;) are not the greatest in the
world. Yet it is possible to turn these &quot;disappointing&quot;
stats into a character who is both interesting and fun to play. Too
often players become obsessed with &quot;good&quot; stats. These
players immediately give up on a character if he doesn't have a
majority of above-average scores. There are even those who feel a
character is hopeless if he does not have at least one ability of 17
or higher! Needless to say, these players would never consider
playing a character with an ability score of 6 or 7.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In truth, Rath's
survivability has a lot less to do with his ability scores than with
your desire to role-play him. If you give up on him, of course he
won't survive! But if you take an interest in the character and
role-play him well, then even a character with the lowest possible
scores can present a fun, challenging, and all-around exciting time.
Does he have a Charisma of 5? Why? Maybe he's got an ugly scar. His
table manners could be atrocious. He might mean well but always
manage to say the wrong thing at the wrong time. He could be bluntly
honest to the point of rudeness, something not likely to endear him
to most people. His Dexterity is a 3? Why? Is he naturally clumsy or
blind as a bat?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Don't give up on a character
just because he has a low score. Instead, view it as an opportunity
to role-play, to create a unique and entertaining personality in the
game. Not only will you have fun creating that personality, but other
players and the DM will have fun reacting to him.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">After creating your
character's ability scores, you must select a player character race.
This is not a race in the true sense of the word: caucasian, black,
asian, etc. It is actually a fantasy species for your character --
human, elf, dwarf, gnome, half-elf, or halfling. Each race is
different. Each possesses special powers and has different lists of
classes to choose from.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All six of the standard races
are described in detail in this chapter. In many cases, broad
statements are made concerning the race in general. Players are not
bound by these generalities. For example, the statement that &quot;dwarves
tend to be dour and taciturn&quot; does not mean that your character
cannot be a jolly dwarf. It means that the garden-variety dwarf is
dour and taciturn. If player characters were just like everyone else,
they wouldn't be adventurers. Make your character unique and he will
be more fun to play.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Minimum
and Maximum Ability Scores </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All nonhuman PC races (also
called &quot;demihuman&quot; races) have minimum and maximum
requirements for their ability scores. If you want to have a
demihuman character, the character's ability scores must be within
the allowable range. The minimums and maximums for each race are
listed on Table 7 (the minimums are listed before the slash; the
maximums are listed after the slash). Your character's sex has no
effect on these minimums or maximums.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Consult Table 7 </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>before</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
making any racial adjustments to your character's ability scores. If
the basic scores that you rolled up meet the requirements for a
particular race, your character can be of that race, even if later
modifications change the ability scores so they exceed the maximums
or don't meet the minimums. Once you satisfy the requirements at the
start, you never have to worry about them again.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Table 7 gives the minimum and
maximum scores a newly created character must have to be a member of
a demihuman race. Any character can be a human, if the player so
desires.</font></p>

Restrictions and Level Limits </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The human race has one
special ability in the AD&amp;D game: Humans can choose to be of any
class-- warrior, wizard, priest, or rogue -- and can rise to great
level in any class. The other races have fewer choices of character
classes and usually are limited in the level they can attain. These
restrictions reflect the natural tendencies of the races (dwarves
like war and fighting and dislike magic, etc.). The limits are high
enough so a demihuman can achieve power and importance in at least
one class. A halfling, for example, can become the best thief in the
land, but he cannot become a great fighter.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The limits also exist for
play balance. The ability of humans to assume any role and reach any
level is their only advantage. The demihuman races have other powers
that make them entertaining to play -- particularly the ability to be
multi-classed (see Glossary). These powers balance the enjoyment of
play against the ability to rise in level. Ask your DM for the level
limits imposed on nonhuman characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Languages
</font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Racial languages for
demihumans can be handled in either of two ways, depending on whether
or not your DM uses the optional proficiency system. Either way, your
character automatically knows his native language.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Without the proficiency
system, your character starts adventuring already knowing a number of
additional languages (the number depends on his Int score, see Table
4). The additional languages must be chosen from among those listed
in his race's description.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If you use the proficiency
system, your character receives additional languages by using
proficiency slots (see Chapter 5: Proficiencies) to determine how
many languages he knows when he starts adventuring (his native
language does not cost a slot). Demihumans must choose these
languages from among those listed in the following racial
descriptions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Human PCs generally start the
game knowing only their regional language--the language they grew up
speaking. The DM may decide to allow beginning PCs additional
languages (up to their Int score limit or proficiency slot limit), if
he feels the PCs had the opportunity to learn these as they grew up.
Otherwise, human PCs may learn additional languages as they
adventure.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Dwarves
</b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Dwarves are short, stocky
fellows, easily identified by their size and shape. They average 4 to
4-½ feet tall. They have ruddy cheeks, dark eyes, and dark hair.
Dwarves generally live for 350 years.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Dwarves tend to be dour and
taciturn. They are given to hard work and care little for most humor.
They are strong and brave. They enjoy beer, ale, mead, and even
stronger drink. Their chief love, however, is precious metal,
particularly gold. They prize gems, of course, especially diamonds
and opaque gems (except pearls, which they do not like). Dwarves like
the earth and dislike the sea. Not overly fond of elves, they have a
fierce hatred of orcs and goblins. Their short, stocky builds make
them ill-suited for riding horses or other large mounts (although
ponies present no difficulty), so they tend to be a trifle dubious
and wary of these creatures. They are ill-disposed toward magic and
have little talent for it, but revel in fighting, warcraft, and
scientific arts such as engineering.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Though dwarves are suspicious
and avaricious, their courage and tenacity more than compensate for
these shortcomings.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Dwarves typically dwell in
hilly or mountainous regions. They prefer life in the comforting
gloom and solidness that is found underground. They have several
special abilities that relate to their underground life, and they are
noted for being particularly resistant to magics and poisons.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A character of the dwarven
race can be a cleric, a fighter, or a thief. He can also choose to be
a fighter/cleric or fighter/thief.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	From living underground,
dwarves have found it useful to learn the languages of several of
their neighbors, both friendly and hostile. The initial languages a
dwarf can learn are common, dwarf, gnome, goblin, kobold, orc, and
any others your DM allows. The actual number of languages is limited
by the Intelligence of the player character (see Table 4) or by the
proficiency slots he allots to languages (if that optional system is
used).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By nature, dwarves are
nonmagical and never use magical spells (priest spells are allowed
however). This gives a bonus to dwarves' saving throws against
attacks from magical wands, staves, rods, and spells. This bonus is
+1 for every 3 - ½ points of Constitution score. Thus, for example,
if a dwarf has a Constitution score of 7 he gains +2 on saving
throws. These bonuses are summarized on Table 9.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Similarly, dwarves have
exceptional resistance to toxic substances. All dwarven characters
make saving throws against poison with the same bonuses that they get
against magical attacks (see Table 9).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Also because of their
nonmagical nature, however, dwarves have trouble using magical items.
All magical items that are not specifically suited to the character's
class have a 20% chance to malfunction when used by a dwarf. This
check is made each time a dwarf uses a magical item. A malfunction
affects only the current use; the item may work properly next time.
For devices that are continually in operation, the check is made the
first time the device is used during an encounter. If the check is
passed, the device functions normally until it is turned off. Thus, a
dwarf would have to check upon donning a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>robe
of blending</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> but
would not check again until he had taken the robe off and then put it
on again. If a cursed item malfunctions, the character recognizes its
cursed nature and can dispose of the item. Malfunction applies to
rods, staves, wands, rings, amulets, potions, horns, jewels, and all
other magical items except weapons, shields, armor, gauntlets, and
girdles. This penalty does not apply to dwarven clerics using priest
items.</font></p>

</b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Elves tend to be somewhat
shorter and slimmer than normal humans. Their features are finely
chiseled and delicate, and they speak in melodic tones. Although they
appear fragile and weak, as a race they are quick and strong. Elves
often live to be over 1,200 years old, although long before this time
they feel compelled to depart the realms of men and mortals. Where
they go is uncertain, but it is an undeniable urge of their race.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Elves are often considered
frivolous and aloof. In fact, they are not, although humans often
find their personalities impossible to fathom. They concern
themselves with natural beauty, dancing and frolicking, playing and
singing, unless necessity dictates otherwise. They are not fond of
ships or mines, but enjoy growing things and gazing at the open sky.
Even though elves tend toward haughtiness and arrogance at times,
they regard their friends and associates as equals. They do not make
friends easily, but a friend (or enemy) is never forgotten. They
prefer to distance themselves from humans, have little love for
dwarves, and hate the evil denizens of the woods.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Their humor is clever, as are
their songs and poetry. Elves are brave but never foolhardy. They eat
sparingly; they drink mead and wine, but seldom to excess. While they
find well-wrought jewelry a pleasure to behold, they are not overly
interested in money or gain. They find magic and swordplay (or any
refined combat art) fascinating. If they have a weakness it lies in
these interests.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are five branches of
the elven race; aquatic, gray, high, wood, and dark. Elf player
characters are always assumed to be of the most common type -- high
elves -- although a character can be another type of elf with the
DM's permission (but the choice grants no additional powers). To the
eye of outsiders, the differences between the groups are mostly
cosmetic, but most elves maintain that there are important cultural
differences between the various groups. Aquatic elves spend their
lives beneath the waves and have adapted to these conditions. Gray
elves are considered the most noble and serious-minded of this breed.
High elves are the most common. Wood elves are considered to be wild,
temperamental, and savage. All others hold that the subterranean dark
elves are corrupt and evil, no longer part of the elven community.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A player character elf can be
a cleric, fighter, wizard, thief, or ranger. In addition, an elf can
choose to be a multi-class fighter/mage, fighter/thief, or ranger. In
addition, an elf can choose to be a multi-class fighter/mage,
fighter/thief, fighter/mage/thief, or mage/thief. (The rules
governing these combinations are explained under &quot;Multi-Class
and Dual-Class Characters&quot; in Chapter 3: Player Character
Classes).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Elves have found it useful to
learn the languages of several of the forest's children, both the
good and the bad. As initial languages, an elf can choose common,
elf, gnome, halfling, goblin, hobgoblin, orc, and gnoll. The number
of languages an elf can learn is limited by his Intelligence (see
Table 4) or the proficiency slots he allots to languages (if that
optional system is used).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Elven characters have 90%

spells. (See Chapter 9: Combat for an explanation of magic
resistance.) This is in addition to the normal saving throw allowed
against a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>charm</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell.</font></p>

sort other than a crossbow, or when using a short or long sword,
elves gain a bonus of +1 to their attack rolls.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	An elf can gain a bonus to
surprise opponents, but only if the elf is not in metal armor. Even
then, the elf must either be alone, or with a party comprised only of
elves or halflings (also not in metal armor), or 90 feet or more away
from his party (the group of characters he is with) to gain this
bonus. If he fulfills these conditions, he moves so silently that
opponents suffer a -4 penalty to their surprise die rolls. If the elf
must open a door or screen to attack, this penalty is reduced to -2.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Secret doors (those
constructed so as to be hard to notice) and concealed doors (those
hidden from sight by screens, curtains, or the like) are difficult to
hide from elves. Merely passing within 10 feet of a concealed door
gives an elven character a one-in-six chance (roll a 1 on 1d6) to
notice it. If actively searching for such doors, elven characters
have a    one-in-three chance (roll a 1 or 2 on 1d6) to find a
secret door and a one-in-two chance (roll a 1, 2, or 3 on 1d6) to
discover a concealed portal.</font></p>

<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Gnomes
</b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Kin to dwarves, gnomes are
noticeably smaller than their distant cousins. Gnomes, as they
proudly maintain, are also less rotund than dwarves. Their noses,
however, are significantly larger. Most gnomes have dark tan or brown
skin and white hair. A typical gnome lives for 350 years.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Gnomes have lively and sly
senses of humor, especially for practical jokes. They have a great
love of living things and finely wrought items, particularly gems and
jewelry. Gnomes love all sorts of precious stones and are masters of
gem polishing and cutting.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Gnomes prefer to live in
areas of rolling, rocky hills, well wooded and uninhabited by humans.
Their diminutive stature has made them suspicious of the larger
races--humans and elves--although they are not hostile. They are sly
and furtive with those they do not know or trust, and somewhat
reserved even under the best of circumstances. Dwelling in mines and
burrows, they are sympathetic to dwarves, but find their cousins'
aversion to surface dwellers foolish.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A gnome character can elect
to be a fighter, a thief, a cleric, or an illusionist. A gnome can
have two classes, but not three: fighter/thief, illusionist/thief,
etc.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Due to his upbringing, a
beginning gnome character can choose to know the following languages,
in addition to any others allowed by the DM: common, dwarf, gnome,
halfling, goblin, kobold, and the simple common speech of burrowing
mammals (moles, badgers, weasels, shrews, ground squirrels, etc.).
The actual number of languages a character begins with depends upon
his Intelligence score (see Table 4) or the proficiency slots he
allots to languages (if that optional system is used).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Like their cousins the
dwarves, gnomes are highly magic resistant. A gnome player character
gains a bonus of +1 for every 3½ points of Constitution score, just
as dwarves do (see Table 9). This bonus applies to saving throws
against magical wands, staves, rods, and spells.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Gnomes also suffer a 20%
chance for failure every time they use any magical item except
weapons, armor, shields, illusionist items, and (if the character is
a thief) items that duplicate thieving abilities. This check is made
each time the gnome attempts to use the device, or, in the case of
continuous-use devices, each time the device is activated. Like
dwarves, gnomes can sense a cursed item if the device fails to
function.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In melee, gnome characters
add 1 to their attack rolls to hit kobolds or goblins. When gnolls,
bugbears, ogres, trolls, ogre magi, giants, or titans attack gnomes,
these monsters must subtract 4 from their attack rolls because of the
gnomes' small size and their combat skills against these much larger
creatures.</font></p>

them to see up to 60 feet in the dark.</font></p>

for one round to use any of these abilities.</font></p>

<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Half-Elves
</b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Half-elves are the most common
mixed-race beings. The relationship between elf, human, and half-elf
is defined as follows: 1) Anyone with both elven and human ancestors
is either a human or a half-elf (elves have only elven ancestors). 2)
If there are more human ancestors than elven, the person is human; if
there are equal numbers or more elves, the person is half-elven.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Half-elves are usually much
like their elven parent in appearance. They are handsome folk, with
the good features of each of their races. They mingle freely with
either race, being only slightly taller than the average elf (5 feet
6 inches on average) and weighing about 150 pounds. They typically
live about 160 years. They do not have all the abilities of the elf,
nor do they have the flexibility of unlimited level advancement of
the human. Finally, in some of the less-civilized nations, half-elves
are viewed with suspicion and superstition.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In general, a half-elf has
the curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition of his human ancestors and
the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of his elven
ancestors.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Half-elves do not form
communities among themselves; rather, they can be found living in
both elven and human communities. The reactions of humans and elves
to half-elves ranges from intrigued fascination to outright bigotry.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of all the demihuman races,
half-elves have the greatest range of choices in character class.
They tend to make good druids and rangers. A half-elf can choose to
be a cleric, druid, fighter, ranger, mage, specialist wizard, thief,
or bard. In addition, a half-elf can choose from the following
multi-class combinations: cleric (or druid)/fighter, cleric (or
druid)/fighter/mage, cleric (or druid)/ranger, cleric (or
druid)/mage, fighter/mage, fighter/thief, fighter/mage/thief, and
mage/thief. The half-elf must abide by the rules for multi-class
characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Half-elves do not have a
language of their own. Their extensive contact with other races
enables them to choose any of the following languages (plus any other
allowed by the DM): common, elf, gnome, halfling, goblin, hobgoblin,
orc, and gnoll. The actual number of languages the character knows is
limited by his Intelligence (see Table 4) or by the number of
proficiency slots he allots to languages (if that optional system is
used).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Half-elven characters have a
30% resistance to </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>sleep</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Secret or concealed doors are
difficult to hide from half-elves, just as they are from elves.
Merely passing within 10 feet of a concealed door (one hidden by
obstructing curtains, etc.) gives the half-elven character a
one-in-six chance (roll a 1 on 1d6) of spotting it. If the character
is actively seeking to discover hidden doors, he has a one-in-three
chance (roll a 1 or 2 on 1d6) of spotting    a secret door (one
constructed to be undetectable) and a one-in-two chance (roll a 1, 2,

</b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Halflings are short, generally
plump people, very much like small humans. Their faces are round and
broad and often quite florid. Their hair is typically curly and the
tops of their feet are covered with coarse hair. They prefer not to
wear shoes whenever possible. Their typical life expectancy is
approximately 150 years.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Halflings are sturdy and
industrious, generally quiet and peaceful. Overall they prefer the
comforts of home to dangerous adventuring. They enjoy good living,
rough humor, and homespun stories. In fact, they can be a trifle
boring at times. Halflings are not forward, but they are observant
and conversational if in friendly company. Halflings see wealth only
as a means of gaining creature comforts, which they love. Though they
are not overly brave or ambitious, they are generally honest and hard
working when there is need.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Halfling homes are
well-furnished burrows, although most of their work is done on the
surface. Elves generally like them in a patronizing sort of way.
Dwarves cheerfully tolerate them, thinking halflings somewhat soft
and harmless. Gnomes, although they drink more and eat less, like
halflings best, feeling them kindred spirits. Because halflings are
more open and outgoing than any of these other three, they get along
with other races far better.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are three types of
halflings: Hairfeets, Tallfellows, and Stouts. Hairfeets are the most
common type, but for player characters, any of the three is
acceptable.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A halfling character can
choose to be a cleric, fighter, thief, or a multi-class
fighter/thief. The halfling must use the rules provided for
multi-class characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Through their contact with
other races, halfling characters are allowed to choose initial
languages from common, halfling, dwarf, elf, gnome, goblin, and orc,
in addition to any other languages the DM allows. The actual number
of languages the character knows is limited by his Intelligence (see
Table 4) or by the number of proficiency slots he allots to languages
(if that optional system is used).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All halfling characters have
a high resistance to magical spells, so for every 3-½ points of
Constitution score, the character gains a +1 bonus on saving throws
vs. wands, staves, rods, and spells. These bonuses are summarized on
Table 9.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Halflings have a similar
resistance to poisons of all sorts, so they gain a Constitution bonus
identical to that for saving throws vs. magical attacks when they
make saving throws vs. poison (i.e., +1 to +5, depending on
Constitution score).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Halflings have a natural
talent with slings and thrown weapons. Rock pitching is a favorite
sport of many a halfling child. All halflings gain a +1 bonus to
their attack rolls when using thrown weapons and slings.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A halfling can gain a bonus
to surprise opponents, but only if the halfling is not in metal
armor. Even then, the halfling must either be alone, or with a party
comprised only of halflings or elves, or 90 feet or more away from
his party to gain this bonus. If he fulfills any of these conditions,
he causes a -4 penalty to opponents' surprise rolls. If a door or
other screen must be opened, this penalty is reduced to -2.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Depending on their lineage,
certain halfling characters have infravision. Any halfling character
has a 15% chance to have normal infravision (this means he is pure
Stout), out to 60 feet; failing that chance, there is a 25% chance
that he has limited infravision (mixed Stout/Tallfellow or
Stout/Hairfeets lineage), effective out to 30 feet.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Similarly, halflings with any
Stoutish blood can note if a passage is an up or down grade with 75%
accuracy (roll a 1, 2, or 3 on 1d4). They can determine direction
half the time (roll a 1, 2, or 3 on 1d6). These abilities function
only when the character is concentrating on the desired information
to the exclusion of all else, and only if the character is pure or
partially Stout.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Halfling characters have a

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Because of these abilities

<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Other
Characteristics </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">After you have selected a
race, you may want to fill in the details of your character. You are
not required to do so, but there are many situations in which this
information is vital or useful to role-playing.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The sex and name of your
character are up to you. Your character can be of the same sex as
yourself or of the opposite sex.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some people feel it is
important to know whether their character is right- or left-handed.
Actually, this has no bearing on the play of the game, since all
characters are assumed to be reasonably competent with either hand
(that doesn't mean everyone is trained to fight with two weapons). It
is easiest to say that your character has the same handedness as you.
This will result in the normal ratio of right- to left-handed people.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	On occasion it may be useful
to know your character's height and weight. The best way to determine
height and weight is to choose the appropriate numbers, subject to
your DM's approval. If you want a short, pudgy human fighter, you can
select an appropriate height and weight. Otherwise, heights and
weights can be generated randomly using Table 10. Take the
appropriate base score and add the dire roll modifier. As with all
tables, this can create some ridiculous results (one of the problems
with randomness) and, at the same time, cannot account for the full
variety of mankind (or demihumankind). The table only reproduces a
fairly average range for each race. Heights and weights for demihuman
races not listed on the table must be decided by your DM.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The tallest man on record
stood 8 feet 11.1 inches, while the tallest woman was 8 feet 1.25
inches. The shortest man was only 26.5 inches tall and the shortest
woman bettered this at only 24 inches in height. While the lightest
humans are also among the shortest, the heaviest man weighed an
estimated 1,400 pounds and stood only 6 feet 1 inch. The heaviest
woman is thought to have weighed 880 pounds. Obviously, these figures
indicate that there is a great deal of variety possible for player
characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Players may also want to know
their characters' starting ages. Human characters can start at any
age that is agreeable to both the player and the DM. However, all
beginning adventurers are assumed to be at least 16 years old, since
they must grow physically, emotionally, and in practical experience
before they are ready to undertake the rigors of an adventuring life.
Table 11 can be used to give a starting age (add the variable die
roll to the base starting age to get the character's starting age)
and the possible life span of a character, assuming a quiet and
peaceful life. Humans are also included on this list in case you want
to determine their ages randomly. The maximum age for a character
should be secretly determined and recorded by the DM. Player
characters may have an idea of how long they expect to live, but do
not know their true allotted life span.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As a character ages, his
ability scores are affected. Upon reaching one-half of his base
maximum age (45 for a human), the character loses 1 point of Strength
(or half of his exceptional Strength rating) and 1 point of
Constitution, but gains 1 point each of Intelligence and Wisdom. At
two-thirds of his base maximum age (60 for a human), the character
loses 2 more points of Strength (or all his exceptional Strength and
1 point more), 2 points of Dexterity, and 1 more point of
Constitution, but he gains 1 point of Wisdom. Upon reaching the base
maximum age, the character loses 1 more point from each of Strength,
Dexterity, and Constitution, while gaining 1 more point in both
Intelligence and Wisdom. All aging adjustments are cumulative. See
Table 12 for a summary of these effects.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Although many people have

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There may be times when a
magical device or spell adds years to or subtracts years from a
player character's life. This magical aging can have two different
effects. Some magical aging physically affects the character. For
example, a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>haste</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell ages those it affects by one year. This aging is added directly
to the player character's current age. He physically acquires the
appearance of himself one year older (a few more wrinkles, etc.).
Characters who increase in age from magical effects do not gain the
benefits of increased Wisdom and Intelligence--these are a function
of the passage of game time--but the character does suffer the
physical losses to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution associated
with aging. These are breakdowns of the body's systems. Physical age
can also be removed in the same manner. Some potions give years back
to the character. In this case, the physical appearance of the
character is restored. The character can regain lost vigor (Str, Dex,
and Con) as his body is renewed but he does not lose any of the
benefits of aging (Wis and Int).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Magical aging can also work
to increase or decrease the life span of the character. In such a
case, the actual age of hte character is unaffected. All adjustments
are made by the DM to the character's maximum age (which only the DM
knows). For example, a human finds a magical fountain that bestows
great longevity (10 to 60 years more). The DM has already determined
the human will naturally live to 103 years (base 90 + 2d20, in this
case 13). The water of the fountain bestows 40 more years so that,
unless the character meets a violent end, he will live to 143 years.
He still suffers the effects of aging at the usual ages (45, 60, and
90 years, respectively), but the period in which he would be
considered a venerable elder of his people is extended for 40 years.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are a number of other
personal characteristics your character has--hair and eye color, body
shape, voice, noticeable features, and general personality. There are
no tables for these things, nor should there be. Your job, as a
player, is to add these details, thereby creating the type of
character you want. You probably know some from the start (do you
want to play a towering, robust warrior, or a slim, unassuming
swordsman?); others, especially your character's personality, will
grow and take form as you play. Remember, you are an actor and your
character is your role!</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">After choosing your
character's race, you select his character class. A character class
is like a profession or career. It is what your character has worked
and trained at during his younger years. If you wanted to become a
doctor, you could not walk out the door and begin work immediately.
First you would have to get some training. The same is true of
character classes in the AD&amp;D game. Your character is assumed to
have some previous training and guidance before beginning his
adventuring career. Now, armed with a little knowledge, your
character is ready to make his name and fortune. </font>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The character classes are
divided into four groups according to general occupations: warrior,
wizard, priest, and rogue. Within each group are several similar
character classes. All classes within a group share the same Hit
Dice, as well as combat and saving throw progressions. Each character
class within a group has different special powers and abilities that
are available only to that class. Each player must select a group for
his character, then a specific class within that group.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>fighter</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
is a champion, swordsman, soldier, and brawler. He lives or dies by
his knowledge of weapons and tactics. Fighters can be found at the
front of any battle, contesting toe-to-toe with monsters and
villains. A good fighter needs to be strong and healthy if he hopes
to survive.</font></p>

is a warrior bold and pure, the exemplar of everything good and true.
Like the fighter, the paladin is a man of combat. However, the
paladin lives for the ideals of righteousness, justice, honesty,
piety, and chivalry. He strives to be a living example of these
virtues so that others might learn from him as well as gain by his
actions.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>ranger</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
is a warrior and a woodsman. He is skilled with weapons and is
knowledgeable in tracking and woodcraft. The ranger often protects
and guides lost travelers and honest peasant-folk. A ranger needs to

them as spells. To do so, he studies strange tongues and obscure
facts and devotes much of his time to magical research.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A wizard must rely on
knowledge and wit to survive. Wizards are rarely seen adventuring
without a retinue of fighters and men-at-arms.</font></p>

types (or schools) of magic, there are different types of wizards.
The </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>mage</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
studies all types of magic and learns a wide variety of spells. His

is a generic priest (of any mythos) who tends to the needs of a
community. He is both protector and healer. He is not purely
defensive, however. When evil threatens, the cleric is well-suited to
seek it out on its own ground and destroy it.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>druid</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">

they use their skills to correct injustice, spread good will, or
contribute to the success of an adventuring group.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

hallmarks. Whether he turns his talent against innocent passers-by
and wealthy merchants or oppressors and monsters is a choice for the
thief to make.</font></p>

is also a rogue, but he is very different from the thief. His
strength is his pleasant and charming personality. With it and his
wits he makes his way through the world. A bard is a talented
musician and a walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and lore. He
learns a little bit about everything that crosses his path; he is a
jack-of-all-trades but master of none. While many bards are
scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere.</font></p>

an entirely new character. If you desperately want your character to
belong to a particular class but have scores that are too low, your
DM might allow you to increase these scores to the minimum needed.
However, you must ask him first. Don't count on the DM allowing you
to raise a score above 16 in any case.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The principal attribute of a
fighter is Strength. To become a fighter, a character must have a
minimum Strength score of 9. A good Dexterity rating is highly
desirable.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Also, high Strength gives the
fighter a better chance to hit an opponent and enables him to cause
more damage.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The fighter is a warrior, an
expert in weapons and, if he is clever, tactics and strategy. There
are many famous fighter from legend: Hercules, Perseus, Hiawatha,
Beowulf, Siegfried, Cuchulain, Little John, Tristan, and Sinbad.
History is crowded with great generals and warriors: El Cid,
Hannibal, Alexander the Great, Charlemagne, Spartacus, Richard the
Lionheart, and Belisarius. Your fighter could be modeled after any of
these, or he could be unique. A visit to your local library can
uncover many heroic fighters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Fighters can have any
alignment: good or evil, lawful or chaotic, or neutral.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As a master of weapons, the
fighter is the only character able to have weapon specialization
(explained in Chapter 5). Weapon specialization enables the fighter
to use a particular weapon with exceptional skill, improving his
chances to hit and cause damage with that weapon. A fighter character
is not required to specialize in a weapon; the choice is up to the
player. No other character class--not even ranger or paladin--is
allowed weapon specialization.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	While fighters cannot cast
magical spells, they can use many magical items, including potions,
protection scrolls, most rings, and all forms of enchanted armor,
weapons, and shields.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a fighter attains 9th
level (becomes a &quot;Lord&quot;), he can automatically attract
men-at-arms. These soldiers, having heard of the fighter, come for
the chance to gain fame, adventure, and cash. They are loyal as long
as they are well-treated, successful, and paid well. Abusive
treatment or a disastrous campaign can lead to grumbling, desertion,
and possibly mutiny. To attract the men, the fighter must have a
castle or stronghold and sizeable manor lands around it. As he claims
and rules this land, soldiers journey to his domain, thereby
increasing his power. Furthermore, the fighter can tax and develop
these lands, gaining a steady income from them. Your DM has
information about gaining and running a barony.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition to regular
men-at-arms, the 9th-level fighter also attracts an elite bodyguard
(his &quot;household guards&quot;). Although these soldiers are still
mercenaries, they have greater loyalty to their Lord than do common
soldiers. In return, they expect better treatment and more pay than
the common soldier receives. Although the elite unit can be chosen
randomly, it is better to ask your DM what unit your fighter
attracts. This allows him to choose a troop consistent with the
campaign.</font></p>

Lancelot, Sir Gawain, and Sir Galahad are all examples of the class.
However, many brave and heroic soldiers have tried and failed to live
up to the ideals of the paladin. It is not an easy task!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Only a human may become a
paladin. He must have minimum ability scores of Strength 12,
Constitution 9, Wisdom 13, and Charisma 17. Strength and Charisma are
the prime requisites of the paladin. A paladin must be lawful good in
alignment and must always remain lawful good. A paladin who changes
alignment, either deliberately or inadvertently, loses all his
special powers -- sometimes only temporarily and sometimes forever.
He can use any weapon and wear any type of armor.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A paladin who has Strength
and Charisma scores of 16 or more gains a 10% bonus to the experience
points he earns.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Lawfulness and good deeds are
the meat and drink of a paladin. If a paladin ever knowingly performs
a chaotic act, he must seek a high-level (7th or more) cleric of
lawful good alignment, confess his sin, and do penance as prescribed
by the cleric. If a paladin should ever knowingly and willingly
perform an evil act, he loses the status of paladinhood immediately
and irrevocably. All benefits are then lost and no deed or magic can
restore the character to paladinhood: He is ever after a fighter. The
character's level remains unchanged when this occurs and experience
points are adjusted accordingly. Thereafter the character is bound by
the rules for fighters. He does not gain the benefits of weapon
specialization (if this is used) since he did not select this for his
character at the start.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the paladin commits an
evil act while enchanted or controlled by magic, he loses his paladin
status until he can atone for the deed. This loss of status means the
character loses all his special abilities and essentially functions
as a fighter (without weapon specialization) of the same level.
Regaining his status undoubtedly requires completion of some
dangerous quest or important mission to once again prove his worth
and assuage his own guilt. He gains no experience prior to or during
the course of this mission, and regains his standing as a paladin
only upon completing the quest.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The ranger must have scores
not less than 13 in Strength, 14 in Constitution, 13 in Dexterity,
and 14 in Wisdom. The prime requisites of the ranger are Strength,
Dexterity, and Wisdom. Rangers are always good, but they can be
lawful, neutral, or chaotic. It is in the ranger's heart to do good,
but not always by the rules.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A ranger who has Strength,
Dexterity, and Wisdom scores of 16 or more gains a 10% bonus to the
experience points he earns.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although the ranger can use
any weapon and wear any armor, several of his special abilities are
usable only when he is wearing studded leather or lighter armor.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although he has the basic
skills of a warrior, the ranger also has several advantages. When
wearing studded leather or lighter armor, a ranger can fight
two-handed with no penalty to his attack rolls (see &quot;Attacking
with Two Weapons&quot; in Chapter 9: Combat). Obviously, the ranger
cannot use a shield when fighting this way. A ranger can still fight
with two weapons while wearing heavier armor than studded leather,
but he suffers the standard attack roll penalties.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The ranger is skilled
woodsman. Even if the optional proficiency rules are not used, the
ranger has tracking proficiency. If the proficiency rules are used in
your campaign, the ranger knows tracking without expending any
points. Furthermore, this skill improves by +1 for every three levels
the ranger has earned (3rd to 5th level, +1; 6th to 8th level, +2,
etc.). While wearing studded leather or lighter armor, the ranger can
try to move silently and hide in shadows. His chance to succeed in
natural surroundings is given on Table 18 (modified by the ranger's
race and Dexterity, as given on Tables 27 and 28). When attempting
these actions in non-natural surroundings (a musty crypt or city
streets) the chance of success is halved. Hiding in shadows and
moving silently are not possible in any armor heavier than studded
leather--the armor is inflexible and makes too much noise.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In their roles as protector
of good, rangers tend to focus their efforts against some particular
creature, usually one that marauds their homeland. Before advancing
to 2nd level, every ranger must select a species enemy. Typical
enemies include giants, orcs, lizard men, trolls, or ghouls; your DM
has final approval on the choice. Thereafter, whenever the ranger
encounters that enemy, he gains a +4 bonus to his attack rolls. This
enmity can be concealed only with great difficulty, so the ranger
suffers a -4 penalty on all encounter reactions with creatures of the
hated type. Furthermore, the ranger will actively seek out this enemy
in combat in preference to all other foes unless someone else
presents a much greater danger.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Rangers
are adept with both trained and untamed creatures,</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">having a limited
degree of animal empathy. If a ranger carefully approaches or tends
any natural animal, he can try to modify the animal's reactions. (A
natural animal is one that can be found in the real world -- a bear,
snake, zebra, etc.)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When dealing with domestic or
non-hostile animals, a ranger can approach the animal and befriend it
automatically. He can easily discern the qualities of the creature
(spotting the best horse in the corral or seeing that the runt of the
litter actually has great promise).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When dealing with a wild
animal or an animal trained to attack, the animal must roll a saving
throw vs. rods to resist the ranger's overtures. (This table is used
even though the ranger's power is non-magical.) The ranger imposes a
-1 penalty on the die roll for every three experience levels he has
earned (-1 at 1st to 3rd, -2 at 4th to 6th, etc.). If the creature
fails the saving throw, its reaction can be shifted one category as
the ranger chooses. Of course, the ranger must be at the front of the
party and must approach the creature fearlessly.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, Beornhelm, a
7th-level ranger, is leading his friends through the woods. On
entering a clearing, he spots a hungry black bear blocking the path
on the other side. Signaling his friends to wait, Beornhelm
approaches the beast, whispering soothing words. The DM rolls a
saving throw vs. rods for the bear, modified by -3 for Beornhelm's
level. The bear's normal reaction is unfriendly, but Beornhelm's
presence reduces this to neutral. The party waits patiently until the
bear wanders off to seek its dinner elsewhere.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Later, Beornhelm goes to the
horse market to get a new mount. The dealer shows him a spirited
horse, notorious for being vicious and stubborn. Beornhelm approaches
it carefully, again speaking soothingly, and mounts the stallion with
no difficulty. Ridden by Beornhelm, the horse is spirited but
well-behaved. Approached by anyone else, the horse reverts to its old
ways.</font></p>

particular creatures, either choosing from the list above or from any

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	These followers arrive over
the course of several months. often they are encountered during the
ranger's adventures (allowing you and your DM a chance to role-play
the initial meeting). While the followers are automatically loyal and
friendly toward the ranger, their future behavior depends on the
ranger's treatment of them. In all cases, the ranger does not gain
any special method of communicating with his followers. He must
either have some way of speaking to them or they simply mutely
accompany him on his journeys. (</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>&quot;Yeah,
this bear's been with me for years. Don't know why--he just seems to

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of course, the ranger is not
obligated to take on followers. If he prefers to remain independent,
he can release his followers at any time. They reluctantly depart,
but stand ready to answer any call for aid he might put out at a
later time.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Like
the paladin, the ranger has a code of behavior.</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A ranger must always retain
his good alignment. If the ranger intentionally commits an evil act,
he automatically loses his ranger status. Thereafter he is considered
a fighter of the same level (if he has more experience points than a
fighter of his level, he loses all the excess experience points). His
ranger status can never be regained. If the ranger involuntarily
commits an evil act (perhaps in a situation of no choice), he cannot
earn any more experience points until he has cleansed himself of that
evil. This can be accomplished by correcting the wrongs he committed,
revenging himself on the person who forced him to commit the act, or
releasing those oppressed by evil. The ranger instinctively knows
what things he must do to regain his status (i.e., the DM creates a
special adventure for the character).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, rangers tend to
be loners, men constantly on the move. They cannot have henchmen,
hirelings, mercenaries, or even servants until they reach 8th level.
While they can have any monetary amount of treasure, they cannot have
more treasure than they can carry. Excess treasure must either be
converted to a portable form or donated to a worthy institution (an
NPC group, not a player character).</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Wizard
</b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The wizard group encompasses
all spellcasters working in the various fields of magic--both those
who specialize in specific schools of magic and those who study a
broad range of magical theories. Spending their lives in pursuit of
arcane wisdom, wizards have little time for physical endeavors. They
tend to be poor fighters with little knowledge of weaponry. However,
they command powerful and dangerous energies with a few simple
gestures, rare components, and mystical words.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Spells are the tools,
weapons, and armor of the wizard. He is weak in a toe-to-toe fight,
but when prepared he can strike down his foes at a distance, vanish
in an instant, become a wholly different creature, or even invade the
mind of an enemy and take control of his thoughts and actions. No
secrets are safe from a wizard and no fortress is secure. His quest
for knowledge and power often leads him into realms where mortals
were never meant to go.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Wizards cannot wear any
armor, for several reasons. Firstly, most spells require complicated
gestures and odd posturings by the caster and armor restricts the
wearer's ability to do these properly. Secondly, the wizard spent his
youth (and will spend most of his life) learning arcane languages,
poring through old books, and practicing his spells. This leaves no
time for learning other things (like how to wear armor properly and
use it effectively). If the wizard had spent his time learning about
armor, he would not have even the meager skills and powers he begins
with. There are even unfounded theories that claim the materials in
most armors disrupt the delicate fabric of a spell as it gathers
energy; the two cannot exist side by side in harmony. While this idea
is popular with the common people, true wizards know this is simply
not true. If it were, how would they ever be able to cast spells
requiring iron braziers or metal bowls?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For similar reasons, wizards
are severely restricted in the weapons they can use. They are limited
to those that are easy to learn or are sometimes useful in their own
research. Hence, a wizard can use a dagger or a staff, items that are
traditionally useful in magical studies. Other weapons allowed are
darts, knives, and slings (weapons that require little skill, little
strength, or both).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Wizards can use more magical
items than any other characters. These include potions, rings, wands,
rods, scrolls, and most miscellaneous magical items. A wizard can use
a magical version of any weapon allowed to his class but cannot use
magical armor, because no armor is allowed. Between their spells and
magical items, however, wizards wield great power.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, all wizards (whether
mages or specialists) can create new magical items, ranging from
simple scrolls and potions to powerful staves and magical swords.
Once he reaches 9th level, a wizard can pen magical scrolls and brew
potions. He can construct more powerful magical items only after he
has learned the appropriate spells (or works with someone who knows
them). Your DM should consult the Spell Research and Magical Items
sections of the DMG for more information.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	No matter what school of
magic the wizard is involved in, Intelligence is his prime requisite
(or one of several prime requisites). Characters must have an
Intelligence score of at least 9 to qualify to be a wizard.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All wizards use Table 20 to
determine their advancement in level as they earn experience points.
They also use Table 21 to determine the levels and numbers of spells
they can cast at each experience level.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All wizards gain one
four-sided Hit Die (1d4) per level from 1st through 10th levels.
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>After 10th level,
wizards earn 1 hit point per level and they no longer gain additional
hit point bonuses for high Constitution scores.</i></font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Learning and casting spells
require long study, patience, and research. Once his adventuring life
begins, a wizard is largely responsible for his own education; he no
longer has a teacher looking over his shoulder and telling him which
spell to learn next. This freedom is not without its price, however.
It means that the wizard must find his own source for magical
knowledge: libraries, guilds, or captured books and scrolls.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Whenever a wizard discovers
instructions for a spell he doesn't know, he can try to read and
understand the instructions. The player must roll percentile dice. If
the result is equal to or less than the percentage chance to learn a
new spell (listed on Table 4), the character understands the spell
and how to cast it. He can enter the spell in his spell book (unless
he has already learned the maximum number of spells allowed for that
level). If this die roll is higher than the character's chance to
learn the spell, he doesn't understand the spell. Once a spell is
learned, it cannot be unlearned. It remains part of that character's
repertoire forever. Thus, a character cannot choose to &quot;forget&quot;
a spell so as to replace it with another.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A wizard's spell book can be
a single book, a set of books, a bundle of scrolls, or anything else
your DM allows. The spell book is the wizard's diary, laboratory
journal, and encyclopedia, containing a record of everything he
knows. Naturally, it is his most treasured possession; without it he
is almost helpless.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A spell book contains the
complicated instructions for casting the spell -- the spell's recipe,
so to speak. Merely reading these instructions aloud or trying to
mimic the instructions does not enable one to cast the spell. Spells
gather and shape mystical energies; the procedures involved are very
demanding, bizarre, and intricate. Before a wizard can actually cast
a spell, he must memorize its arcane formula. This locks an energy
pattern for that particular spell into his mind. Once he has the
spell memorized, it remains in his memory until he uses the exact
combination of gestures, words, and materials that triggers the
release of this energy pattern. Upon casting, the energy of the spell
is spent, wiped clean from the wizard's mind. The wizard cannot cast
that spell again until he returns to his spell book and memorizes it
again.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Initially the wizard is able
to retain only a few of these magical energies in his mind at one
time. Furthermore, some spells are more demanding and complex than
others; these are impossible for the inexperienced wizard to
memorize. With experience, the wizard's talent expands. He can
memorize more spells and more complex spells. Still, he never escapes
his need to study; the wizard must always return to his spell books
to refresh his powers.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Another important power of
the wizard is his ability to research new spells and construct
magical items. Both endeavors are difficult, time-consuming, costly,
occasionally even perilous. Through research, a wizard can create an
entirely new spell, subject to the DM's approval. Likewise, by
consulting with your DM, your character can build magical items,
either similar to those already given in the rules or of your own
design. Your DM has information concerning spell research and magical
item creation. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Unlike many other characters,
wizards gain no special benefits from building a fortress or
stronghold. They can own property and receive the normal benefits,
such as monthly income and mercenaries for protection. However, the
reputations of wizards tend to discourage people from flocking to
their doors. At best, a wizard may acquire a few henchmen and
apprentices to help in his work.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mages are the most versatile
types of wizards, those who choose not to specialize in any single
school of magic. This is both an advantage and disadvantage. On the
positive side, the mage's selection of spells enables him to deal
with many different situations. (Wizards who study within a single
school of magic learn highly specialized spells, but at the expense
of spells from other areas.) The other side of the coin is that the
mage's ability to learn specialized spells is limited compared to the
specialist's.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Mages have no historical
counterparts; they exist only in legend and myth. However, players
can model their characters after such legendary figures as Merlin,
Circe, or Medea. Accounts of powerful wizards and sorceresses are
rare, since their reputations are based in no small part on the
mystery that surrounds them. These legendary figures worked toward
secret ends, seldom confiding in the normal folk around them.</font></p>

Schools of Magic </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Spells are divided into nine
different categories, or schools, according to the types of magical
energy they utilize. Each school has its own special methods and
practices.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although they are called
schools, schools of magic are not organized places where a person
goes to study. The word &quot;school&quot; identifies a magical
discipline. A school is an approach to magic and spellcasting that
emphasizes a particular sort of spell. Practitioners of a school of
magic may set up a magical university to teach their methods to
beginners, but this is not necessary. Many powerful wizards learned
their craft studying under reclusive masters in distant lands.</font></p>

schools that oppose each other. See Table 22 and its entry
descriptions for more information.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of these schools, eight are
greater schools while the ninth, lesser divination, is a minor
school. The minor school of lesser divination includes all divination
spells of the 4th spell level or less (available to all wizards).
Greater divinations are those divination spells of the 5th spell or

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Specialist
Wizards</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A wizard who concentrates his
effort in a single school of magic is called a specialist. There are
specialists in each type of magic, although some are extremely rare.
Not all specialists are well-suited to adventuring--the diviner's
spells are limited and not generally useful in dangerous situations.
On the other hand, player characters might want to consult an NPC
diviner before starting an adventure.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Specialist wizards have
advantages and disadvantages when compared to mages. Their chance to
know spells of their school of magic is greatly increased, but the
intensive study results in a smaller chance to know spells outside
their school. The number of spells they can cast increases, but they
lose the ability to cast spells of the school in opposition to their
specialty (opposite it in the diagram). Their ability to research and
create new spells within their specialty is increased, but the
initial selection of spells in their school may be quite limited. All
in all, players must consider the advantages and disadvantages
carefully.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Not all wizards can become
specialists. The player character must meet certain requirements to
become a specialist. Most specialist wizards must be single-classed;
multi-classed characters cannot become specialists, except for
gnomes, who seem to have more of a natural bent for the school of
illusion than characters of any other race. Dual-class humans </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>can</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
choose to become specialists. The dedication to the particular school
of magic requires all the attention and concentration of the
character. He does not have time for other class-related pursuits.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition, each school has
different restrictions on race, ability scores, and schools of magic
allowed. These restrictions are given on Table 22. Note that lesser
divination is not available as a specialty. The spells of this group,
vital to the functioning of a wizard, are available to all wizards.</font></p>

of fate, are allowed to specialize in that art. Note that the gnome,
though unable to be a regular mage, can specialize in illusions.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">always includes
the school directly opposite the character's school of study in the
diagram. In addition, the schools to either side of this one may also
be disallowed due to the nature of the character's school. For
example, an invoker/evoker cannot learn enchantment/charm or
conjuration/summoning spells and cannot use magical items that
duplicate spells from these schools.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Being a specialist does have
significant advantages to balance the trade-offs the character must
make. These are listed here:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A specialist gains one
additional spell per spell level, provided the additional spell is
taken in the specialist's school. Thus, a 1st-level illusionist could
have two spells--one being any spell he knows and the other limited
to spells of the illusion school.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Because specialists have an
enhanced understanding of spells within their school, they receive a
+1 bonus when making saving throws against those spells when cast by
other wizards. Likewise, other characters suffer a -1 penalty when
making saving throws against a specialist casting spells within his
school. Both of these modifiers can be in effect at the same
time--for example, when an enchanter casts an enchantment spell at
another enchanter, the modifiers cancel each other out.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Specialists receive a bonus
of +15% when learning spells from their school and a penalty of -15%
when learning spells from other schools. The bonus or penalty is
applied to the percentile dice roll the player must make when the
character tries to learn a new spell (see Table 4).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Whenever a specialist
reaches a new spell level, he automatically gains one spell of his
school to add to his spell books. This spell can be selected by the
DM or he can allow the player to pick. No roll for learning the spell
need be made. It is assumed that the character has discovered this
new spell during the course of his research and study.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a specialist wizard
attempts to create a new spell (using the rules given in the DMG),
the DM should count the new spell as one level less (for determining
the difficulty) if the spell falls within the school of the
specialist. An enchanter attempting to create a new enchantment spell
would have an easier time of it than an illusionist attempting to do
the same.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The illusionist is an example
of a specialist. The description of the illusionist given here can be
used as a guide for creating wizards specializing in other magical
schools.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	First, the school of illusion
is a very demanding field of study. To specialize as an illusionist,
a wizard needs a Dexterity score of at least 16.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	An illusionist who has an
Intelligence of 16 or more gains a 10% bonus to the experience points
he earns.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Because the illusionist knows
far more about illusions than the standard wizard, he is allowed a +1
bonus when rolling saving throws against illusions; other characters
suffer a -1 penalty when rolling saving throws against his illusions.
(These modifiers apply only if the spell allows a saving throw.)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Through the course of his
studies, the illusionist has become adept at memorizing illusion
spells (though it is still an arduous process). He can memorize an
extra illusion spell at each spell level. Thus, as a 1st-level caster
he can memorize two spells, although at least one of these must be an
illusion spell.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Later, when he begins to
research new spells for his collection, he finds it easier to devise
new illusion spells to fill specialized needs. Research in other
schools is harder and more time consuming for him.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, the intense study of
illusion magic prevents the character from mastering the other
classes of spells that are totally alien to the illusion school
(those diametrically opposite illusion on the diagram). Thus, the
illusionist cannot learn spells from the schools of necromancy,
invocation/evocation, or abjuration.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As an example, consider
Joinville the illusionist. He has an Intelligence score of 15. In the
course of his travels he captures an enemy wizard's spell book that
contains an </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>improved
invisibility</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell,
a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>continual light</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell, and a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>fireball</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell, none of which are in Joinville's spell book. He has an 80%
chance to learn the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>improved
invisibility</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell.
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Continual light</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
is an alteration spell, however, so his chance to learn it is only
50% (consult Table 4 to see where these figures come from). He cannot
learn the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>fireball</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell, or even transcribe it into his spell book, because it is an
evocation spell.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The priest is a believer and
advocate of a god from a particular mythos. More than just a
follower, he intercedes and acts on behalf of others, seeking to use
his powers to advance the beliefs of his mythos.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All priests have certain
powers: The ability to cast spells, the strength of arm to defend
their beliefs, and special, deity-granted powers to aid them in their
calling. While priests are not as fierce in combat as warriors, they
are trained to use weaponry in the fight for their cause. They can
cast spells, primarily to further their god's aims and protect its
adherents. They have few offensive spells, but these are very
powerful.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All priests use eight-sided

armor, but the restrictions vary according to the mythos.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All priests use Table 23 to
determine their advancement in level as they gain experience points.
They also all use Table 24 to determine how many spells they receive
at each level of experience.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All priests spells are
divided into 16 categories called </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
spheres of influence. </i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
Different types of priests    have access to different spheres;
no priest can cast spells from every sphere of influence. The 16

Combat, Creation, Divination, Elemental, Guardian, Healing,
Necromantic, Plant, Protection, Summoning, Sun, and Weather.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	 In addition, a priest has
either major or minor access to a sphere. A priest with major access
to a sphere can (eventually) cast all spells in the sphere. A priest
with minor access to a sphere can cast only 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-level
spells from that sphere.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The most common type of
priest is the cleric. The cleric may be an adherent of any religion
(though if the DM designs a specific mythos, the cleric's abilities
and spells may be changed--see following).    Clerics are
generally good, but are not restricted to good; they can have any
alignment acceptable to their order. A cleric must have a Wisdom
score of 9 or more. High constitution and Charisma are also
particularly useful.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A cleric who has a Wisdom of
16 or more gains a 10% bonus to the experience points he earns.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The cleric class is similar
to certain religious orders of knighthood of the Middle Ages: the
Teutonic Knights, the Knights Templars, and Hospitalers. These orders
combined military and religious training with a code of protection
and service. Memberswere trained as knights and devoted themselves to
the service of the church. These orders were frequently found on the
outer edges of the Christian world, either on the fringe of the
wilderness or in war-torn lands. Archbishop Turpin (of </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>The
Song of Roland</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">) is
an example of such a cleric. Similar orders can also be found in
other lands, such as the sohei of Japan.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Clerics are sturdy soldiers,
although their selection of weapons is limited. They can wear any
type of armor and use any shield. Standard clerics, being reluctant
to shed blood or spread violence, are allowed to use only blunt,
bludgeoning weapons. They can use a fair number of magical items
including priest scrolls, most potions and rings, some wands and
rods, staves, armor, shields, and magical versions of any weapons
allowed by their order.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Spells are the main tools of
the cleric, however, helping him to serve, fortify, protect, and
revitalize those under his care. He has a wide variety of spells to
choose from, suitable to many different purposes and needs. (A priest
of a specific mythos probably has a more restricted range of spells.)
A cleric has major access to every sphere of influence except the
plant, animal, weather, and elemental spheres (he has minor access to
the elemental sphere and cannot cast spells of the other three
spheres).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The cleric receives his
spells as insight directly from his deity (the deity does not need to
make a personal appearance to grant the spells the cleric prays for),
as a sign of and reward for his faith, so he must take care not to
abuse his power lest it be taken away as punishment.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The cleric is also granted
power over undead -- evil creatures that exist in a form of non-life,
neither dead nor alive. The cleric is charged with defeating these
mockeries of life. His ability to </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>turn
undead</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> (see
&quot;Turning Undead&quot; in Chapter 9: Combat) enables him to drive
away these creatures or destroy them utterly (though a cleric of evil
alignment can bind the creatures to his will). Some of the more
common undead creatures are ghosts, zombies, skeletons, ghouls, and
mummies. Vampires and liches (undead sorcerers) are two of the most
powerful undead.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As a cleric advances in
level, he gains additional spells, better combat skills, and a
stronger turning ability. Upon reaching 8th level, the cleric
automatically attracts a fanatically loyal group of believers,
provided the character has established a place of worship of
significant size. The cleric can build this place of worship at any
time during his career, but he does not attract believers until he
reaches 8th level. These followers are normal warriors, 0-level
soldiers, ready to fight for the cleric's cause. The cleric attracts
20 to 200 of these followers; they arrive over a period of several
weeks. After the initial followers assemble, no new followers trickle
in to fill the ranks of those who have fallen in service. The DM
decides the exact number and types of followers attracted by the
cleric. The character can hire other troops as needed, but these are
not as loyal as his followers.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At 9th level, the cleric may
receive official approval to establish a religious stronghold, be it
a fortified abbey or a secluded convent. Obviously, the stronghold
must contain all the trappings of a place of worship and must be
dedicated to the service of the cleric's cause. However, the
construction cost of the stronghold is half the normal price, since
the work has official sanction and much of the labor is donated. The
cleric can hold property and build a stronghold any time before
reaching 9th level, but this is done without church sanction and does
not receive the benefits described above.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Priests
of Specific Mythoi </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In the simplest version of
the AD&amp;D game, clerics serve religions that can be generally
described as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil.&quot; Nothing more needs
to be said about it; the game will play perfectly well at this level.
However, a DM who has taken the time to create a detailed campaign
world has often spent some of that time devising elaborate pantheons,
either unique creations or adaptations from history or literature. If
the option is open (and only your DM can decide), you may want your
character to adhere to a particular mythos, taking advantage of the
detail and color your DM has provided. If your character follows a
particular mythos, expect him to have abilities, spells, and
restrictions different from the generic cleric.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Priesthood in any mythos must
be defined in five categories: requirements, weapons allowed, spells
allowed, granted powers, and ethos.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Requirements</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before a character can become
a priest of a particular mythos, certain requirements must be met.
These usually involve minimum ability scores and mandatory
alignments. All priests, regardless of mythos, must have Wisdom
scores of at least 9. Beyond this, your DM can set other requirements
as needed. A god of battle, for example, should require strong,
healthy priests (13 Str, 12 Con). One whose sphere is art and beauty
should demand high Wisdom and Charisma (16 or better). Most deities
demand a specific type of behavior from their followers, and this
will dictate alignment choices.</font></p>

Allowed</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Not all mythoi are opposed to
the shedding of blood. Indeed, some require their priests to use
swords, spears, or other specific weapons. A war deity might allow
his priests to fight with spears or swords. An agricultural deity
might emphasize weapons derived from farm implements -- sickles and
bills, for example. A deity of peace and harmony might grant only the
simplest and least harmful weapons -- perhaps only lassoes and nets.
Given below are some suggested weapons, but many more are possible
(the DM </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>always</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of course there are many
other reasons a deity might be associated with a particular weapon or
group of weapons. These are often cultural, reflecting the weapons
used by the people of the area. There may be a particular legend
associated with the deity, tying it to some powerful artifact weapon
(Thor's hammer, for example). The DM has the final choice in all
situations.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Spells
Allowed</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A priest of a particular
mythos is allowed to cast the spells from only a few, related
spheres. The priest's deity will have major and minor accesses to
certain spheres, and this determines the spells available to the
priest. (Each deity's access to spheres is determined by the DM as he
creates the pantheon of his world.) The 16 spheres of influence are
defined in the following paragraphs.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A priest whose deity grants
major access to a sphere can choose from any spell within that sphere
(provided he is high enough in level to cast it), while one allowed
only minor access to the sphere is limited to spells of 3rd level or
below in that sphere. The combination of major and minor accesses to
spheres results in a wide variation in the spells available to
priests who worship different deities.</font></p>

spells serve to call creatures from other places, or even other
dimensions, to the service of the priest. Such service is often
against the will of the creature, so casting these spells often
involves great risk. Since creatures summoned often cause great harm
and destruction, these spells are sometimes bestowed by war or death
powers.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, the priest can
obtain his spells at a faster or slower pace than the normal cleric.
Should the character's ethos place emphasis on self-reliance, the
spell progression is slower. Those deities associated with many
amazing and wondrous events might grant more spells per level. Of
course, your DM has final say on this, and he must balance the gain
or loss of spells against the other powers, abilities, and
restrictions of the character.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All priests must live by
certain tenets and beliefs. These guide the priests' behavior.
Clerics generally try to avoid shedding blood and try to aid their
community. A war deity may order its priests to be at the forefront
of battles and to actively crusade against all enemies. A harvest
deity may want its priests to be active in the fields. The ethos may
also dictate what alignment the priest must be. The nature of the
mythos helps define the strictures the priest must follow.</font></p>

Titles</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Priests of differing mythoi
often go by titles and names other than priest. A priest of nature,
for example (especially one based on Western European tradition)
could be called a druid (see below). Shamans and witch doctors are
also possibilities. A little library research will turn up many more
unique and colorful titles, a few of which are listed here:</font></p>

It All</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When creating a priest of a
specific mythos, careful attention must be given to the balance of
the character's different abilities. A priest strong in one area or
having a wide range of choice must be appropriately weakened in
another area so that he does not become too powerful compared to the
other priests in the game. If a war deity allows a priest the use of
all weapons and armor, the character should be limited in the spells
allowed or powers granted. At the other extreme, a character who
follows a deity of peace should have significant spells and granted
powers to make up for his extremely limited or non-existent choice of
weapons. A druid, for example, has more granted powers than a normal
cleric to compensate for his limited armor and spell selection.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Historically, druids lived
among the Germanic tribes of Western Europe and Britain during the
days of the Roman Empire. They acted as advisors to chieftains and
held great influence over the tribesmen. Central to their thinking
was the belief that the earth was the mother and source of all life.
They revered many natural things -- the sun, moon, and certain trees
-- as deities. Druids in the AD&amp;D game, however, are only loosely
patterned after these historical figures. They are not required to
behave like or follow the beliefs of historical druids.</font></p>

is allowed to use only &quot;natural&quot; armors -- padded, hide, or
leather armor and wooden shields, including those with magical

bird to as large as a black bear. Upon assuming a new form, the druid
heals 10-60% (1d6 × 10%) of all damage he has suffered (round
fractions down). The druid can only assume the form of a normal (real
world) animal in its normal proportions, but by doing so he takes on
all of that creature's characteristics -- its movement rate and

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As protectors of nature,
druids are aloof from the complications of the temporal world. Their
greatest concern is for the continuation of the orderly and proper
cycles of nature--birth, growth, death, and rebirth. Druids tend to
view all things as cyclic and thus, the battles of good and evil are
only the rising and falling tides of time. Only when the cycle and
balance are disrupted does the druid become concerned. Given this
view of things, the druid must be neutral in alignment.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Druids are charged with
protecting wilderness--in particular trees, wild plants, wild
animals, and crops. By association, they are also responsible for
their followers and their animals. Druids recognize that all
creatures (including humans) need food, shelter, and protection from
harm. Hunting, farming, and cutting lumber for homes are logical and
necessary parts of the natural cycle. However, druids do not tolerate
unnecessary destruction or exploitation of nature for profit. Druids
often prefer subtle and devious methods of revenge against those who
defile nature. It is well known that druids are both very unforgiving
and very patient.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mistletoe is an important
holy symbol to druids and it is a necessary part of some spells
(those requiring a holy symbol). To be fully effective, the mistletoe
must be gathered by the light of the full moon using a golden or
silver sickle specially made for the purpose. Mistletoe gathered by
other means halves the effectiveness of a given spell, if it causes
damage or has an area of effect, and grants the target a +2 bonus to
his saving throw if a saving throw is applicable.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Druids as a class do not
dwell permanently in castles, cities, or towns. All druids prefer to
live in sacred groves, where they build small sod, log, or stone
cottages.</font></p>

can hold each level.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Druids,
Archdruids, and the Great Druid</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At 12th level, the druid
character acquires the official title of &quot;druid&quot; (all druid
characters below 12th level are officially known as &quot;initiates&quot;).
There can be only nine 12th-level druids in any geographic region (as
defined by oceans, seas, and mountain ranges; a continent may consist
of three or four such regions). A character cannot reach 12th level
unless he takes his place as one of the nine druids. This is possible
only if there are currently fewer than nine druids in the region, or
if the character defeats one of the nine druids in magical or
hand-to-hand combat, thereby assuming the defeated druid's position.
If such combat is not mortal, the loser drops experience points so
that he has exactly 200,000 remaining--just enough to be 11th level.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The precise details of each
combat are worked out between the two combatants in advance. The
combat can be magical, non-magical, or a mixture of both. It can be
fought to the death, until only one character is unconscious, until a
predetermined number of hit points is lost, or even until the first
blow is landed, although in this case both players would have to be
supremely confident of their abilities. Whatever can be agreed upon
between the characters is legitimate, so long as there is some
element of skill and risk.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a character becomes a
12th-level druid, he gains three underlings. Their level depends on
the character's position among the nine druids. The druid with the
most experience points is served by three initiates of 9th level; the
second-most experienced druid is served by three initiates of 8th
level; and so on, until the least experienced druid is served by
three 1st-level initiates.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Only three archdruids (13th
level) can operate in a geographical region. To become an archdruid,
a 12th-level druid must defeat one of the reigning archdruids or
advance into a vacant position. Each of the three archdruids is
served by three initiates of 10th level. From among the archdruids of
the entire world, three are chosen to serve the Grand Druid (see &quot;The
Grand Druid and Hierophant Druids&quot; section). These three retain
their attendees but are themselves servants of the Grand Druid.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The Great Druid (14th level)
is unique in his region. He, too, won his position from the previous
great druid. He is served by three initiates of 11th level.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The ascendance of a new Great
Druid usually sets off shock waves of turmoil and chaos through the
druidical hierarchy. The advancement of an archdruid creates an
opening that is fiercely contested by the druids, and the advancement
of a druid creates an opening in their ranks.</font></p>

Grand Druid and Hierophant Druids</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The highest ranking druid in
the world is the Grand Druid (15th level). Unlike great druids
(several of whom can operate simultaneously in different lands), only
one person in a world can ever hold this title at one time.
Consequently, only one druid can be 15th level at any time.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The Grand Druid knows six
spells of each level (instead of the normal spell progression) and
also can cast up to six additional spell levels, either as a single
spell or as several spells whose levels total to six (for example,
one 6th-level spell, six 1st-level spells, three 2nd-level spells,
etc.).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The Grand Druid is attended
by nine other druids who are subject only to him and have nothing to
do with the hierarchy of any specific land or area. Any druid
character of any level can seek the Grand Druid and ask to serve him.
Three of these nine are archdruids who roam the world, acting as his
messengers and agents. Each of them receives four additional spell
levels. The remainder are normally druids of 7th to 11th level,
although the Grand Druid can request a druid of any level to serve
him and often considers applications from humble aspirants.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The position of Grand Druid
is not won through combat. Instead, the Grand Druid selects his
successor from the acting great druids. The position is demanding,
thankless, and generally unexciting for anyone except a politician.
After a few hundred thousand experience points of such stuff, any
adventurer worthy of the name probably is ready to move on to
something else.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For this reason, the Grand
Druid reaches 16th level after earning only 500,000 more experience
points. After reaching 16th level, the Grand Druid can step down from
his position at any time, provided he can find a suitable successor
(another druid with 3,000,000 experience points).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Upon stepping down, the
former Grand Druid must relinquish the six bonus spell levels and all
of his experience points but 1 (he keeps the rest of his abilities).
He is now a 16th-level hierophant druid, and begins advancing anew
(using the progression given in Table 23). The character may rise as
high as 20th level as a hierophant druid (almost always through self
training).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Beyond 15th level, a druid
never gains any new spells (ignore the Priest Spell Progression table
from this point on). Casting level continues to rise with experience.

that the world (and everyone it) somehow owes them a living. They get
by day by day, living in the highest style they can afford and doing
as little work as possible. The less they have to toil and struggle
like everyone else (while maintaining a comfortable standard of
living), the better off they think they are. While this attitude is
neither evil nor cruel, it does not foster a good reputation. Many a
rogue has a questionable past or a shady background he'd prefer was

abilities that are unique to their group. All rogues tend to be adept
at languages and thus, have a percentage chance to read strange
writings they come across. All are skilled in climbing and clinging
to small cracks and outcroppings--even more skilled than the hardy
men of the mountains. They are alert and attentive, hearing things
that others would miss. Finally, they are dexterous (and just a
little bit light-fingered), able to perform tricks and filch small
items with varying degrees of success.</font></p>

special abilities, such as picking pockets and detecting noise, for

When a rogue tries to use a special ability, a percentile dice roll
determines whether the attempt succeeds or fails. If the dice roll is
equal to or less than the special ability score, the attempt
succeeds. Otherwise, it fails.</font></p>

possible. In some ways they are the epitome of roguishness.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The profession of thief is
not honorable, yet it is not entirely dishonorable, either. Many
famous folk heroes have been more than a little larcenous -- Reynard
the Fox, Robin Goodfellow, and Ali Baba are but a few. At his best,
the thief is a romantic hero fired by noble purpose but a little
wanting in strength of character. Such a person may truly strive for
good but continually run afoul of temptation.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The thief's prime requisite
is Dexterity; a character must have a minimum score of 9 to qualify
for the class. While high numbers in other scores (particularly
Intelligence) are desirable, they are not necessary. The thief can
have any alignment except lawful good. Many are at least partially
neutral.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A thief with a Dexterity
score of 16 or more gains a 10% bonus to the experience points he
earns.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thieves have a limited
selection of weapons. Most of their time is spent practicing thieving
skills. The allowed weapons are club, dagger, dart, hand crossbow,
knife, lasso, short bow, sling, broad sword, long sword, short sword,
and staff. A thief can wear leather, studded leather, padded leather,
or elven chain armor. When wearing any allowed armor other than
leather, the thief's abilities are penalized (see Table 29).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To determine the initial
value of each skill, start with the base scores listed on Table 26.
To these base scores, add (or subtract) any appropriate modifiers for
race, Dexterity, and armor worn (given on Tables 27, 28 and 29,
respectively).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The scores arrived at in the
preceding paragraph do not reflect the effort a thief has spent
honing his skills. To simulate this extra training, all thieves at
1st level receive 60 discretionary percentage points that they can
add to their base scores. No more than 30 points can be assigned to
any single skill. Other than this restriction, the player can
distribute the points however he wants.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Each time the thief rises a
level in experience, the player receives another 30 points to
distribute. No more than 15 points per level can be assigned to a
single skill, and no skill can be raised above 95 percent, including
all adjustments for Dexterity, race, and armor. As an option, the DM
can rule that some portion of the points earned must be applied to
skills used during the course of the adventure.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The thief uses
this skill when filching small items from other peoples' pockets,
sleeves, girdles, packs, etc., when palming items (such as keys), and
when performing simple sleight of hand.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A failed attempt means the
thief did not get an item, but it does not mean that his attempt was
detected. To determine whether the victim noticed the thief's
indiscretion, subtract three times the victim's level from 100. If
the thief's pick pockets roll was equal to or greater than this
number, the attempt is detected. A 0th-level victim, for example,
notices the attempt only if the roll was 00 (100), while a 13th-level
character notices the attempt on a dice roll of 61 or more. In some
cases, the attempt may succeed and be noticed at the same time.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If the DM wishes, he can rule
that a thief of higher level than his victim is less likely to be
caught pilfering. The chance that the victim notices the attempt can
be modified by subtracting the victim's level from the thief's level,
and then adding this number to the percentage chance the thief is
detected. For example, Ragnar, a 15th-level thief, tries to pick the
pocket of Horace, a 9th-level fighter. Normally, Ragnar would be
detected if his pick pockets roll was 73 or more (100-[3×9]=73).
Using this optional system, since Ragnar is six levels higher than
Horace, this number is increased by six to 79 (73+6=79). This option
only applies if the thief is higher level than his victim.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A thief can try
to pick padlocks, finesse combination locks (if they exist), and
solve puzzle locks (locks with sliding panels, hidden releases, and
concealed keyholes). Picking a padlock requires tools. Using typical
thief's tools grants normal chances for success. Using improvised
tools (a bit of wire, a thin dirk, a stick, etc.) imposes a penalty
on the character's chance for success. The DM sets the penalty based
on the situation; penalties can range from -5 for an improvised but
suitable tool, to -60 for an awkward and unsuitable item (like a
stick). The amount of time required to pick a lock is 1d10 rounds. A
thief can try to pick a particular lock only once per experience
level. If the attempt fails, the lock is simply too difficult for the
character until he learns more about picking locks (goes up a level).</font></p>

Traps:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The thief is
trained to find small traps and alarms. These include poisoned
needles, spring blades, deadly gases, and warning bells. This skill
is not effective for finding deadfall ceilings, crushing walls, or
other large, mechanical traps.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To find the trap, the thief
must be able to touch and inspect the trapped object. Normally, the
DM rolls the dice to determine whether the thief finds a trap. If the
DM says, &quot;You didn't find any traps,&quot; it's up to the player
to decide whether that means there are no traps or there are traps
but the thief didn't see them. If the thief finds a trap, he knows
its general principle but not its exact nature. A thief can check an
item for traps once per experience level. Searching for a trap takes
1d10 rounds.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once a trap is found, the
thief can try to remove it or disarm it. This also requires 1d10
rounds. If the dice roll indicates success, the trap is disarmed. If
the dice roll indicates failure, the trap is beyond the thief's
current skill. He can try disarming the trap again when he advances
to the next experience level. If the dice roll is 96-100, the thief
accidentally triggers the trap and suffers the consequences.
Sometimes (usually because his percentages are low) a thief will
deliberately spring a trap rather than have unpleasant side effects
if the trap doesn't work quite the way the thief thought, and he
triggers it while standing in the wrong place.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This skill is far less useful
when dealing with magical or invisible traps. Thieves can attempt to
remove these traps, but their chances of success are half their
normal percentages.</font></p>

to move silently at any time simply by announcing that he intends to
do so. While moving silently, the thief's movement rate is reduced to
1/3 normal. The DM rolls percentile dice to determine whether the
thief is moving silently; the thief always </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>thinks</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
he is being quiet. Successful silent movement improves the thief's
chance to surprise a victim, avoid discovery, or move into position
to stab an enemy in the back. Obviously, a thief moving silently but
in plain view of his enemies is wasting his time.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A thief can try
to disappear into shadows or any other type of concealment -- bushes,
curtains, crannies, etc. A thief can hide this way only when no one
is looking at him; he remains hidden only as long as he remains
virtually motionless. (The thief can make small, slow, careful
movements: draw a weapon, uncork a potion, etc.) A thief can never
become hidden while a guard is watching him, no matter what his dice
roll is--his position is obvious to the guard. However, trying to
hide from a creature that is locked in battle with another is
possible, as the enemy's attention is fixed elsewhere. The DM rolls
the dice and keeps the result secret, but the thief always </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>thinks</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
he is hidden.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hiding in shadows cannot be
done in total darkness, since the talent lies in fooling the eye as
much as in finding real concealment (camouflage, as it were).
However, hidden characters are equally concealed to those with or
without infravision. Spells, magical items, and special abilities
that reveal invisible objects can reveal the location of a hidden
thief.</font></p>

pays attention to every detail, no matter how small, including faint
sounds that most others miss. His ability to hear tiny sounds (behind
heavy doors, down long hallways, etc.) is much better than the
ordinary person's. Listening is not automatic; the thief must stand
still and concentrate on what he's hearing for one round. He must
have silence in his immediate surroundings and must remove his helmet
or hat. Sounds filtering through doors or other barriers are unclear
at best.</font></p>

surfaces without tools, ropes, or devices. Only the thief can climb
smooth and very smooth surfaces without climbing gear. Of course, the
thief is very limited in his actions while climbing--he is unable to
fight or effectively defend himself.</font></p>

Languages:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Out of
necessity, thieves tend to learn odd bits of information. Among these
is the ability to read various languages, particularly as they apply
to treasure maps, deeds, secret notes, and the like. At 4th level,
the thief has enough exposure to languages that he has a chance to
read most nonmagical writing. This ability naturally improves with
more experience. However, your DM can rule that some languages (those
the thief has never encountered) are indecipherable to the thief.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The die roll to read a
language must be made every time the character tries to read a
document (not just once per language). A successful die roll means
the thief puzzled out the meaning of the writing. His understanding
of the document is roughly equal to his percentage chance for
success: a 20% chance means that, if the thief understands it at all,
he gets about 20% of the meaning. A different document in the same
language requires another die roll (it probably contains different
words). It isn't necessary to keep notes about what languages the
thief has read in the past, since each document is handled
individually.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Only one die roll can be made
for any particular document at a given experience level. If the die
roll fails, the thief can try again after gaining a new experience
level.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the character knows how to
read a given language because he spent a proficiency slot on it, this
die roll is unnecessary for documents in that language.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thieves have other abilities
not listed on Table 26:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Backstab:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Thieves are weak
in toe-to-toe hacking matches, but they are masters of the knife in
the back. When attacking someone by surprise and from behind, a thief
can improve his chance to successfully hit (+4 modifier for rear
attack and negate the target's shield and Dexterity bonuses) and
greatly increase the amount of damage his blow causes.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To use this ability, the
thief must be behind his victim and the victim must be unaware that
the thief intends to attack him. If an enemy sees the thief, hears
him approach from a blind side, or is warned by another, he is not
caught unaware, and the backstab is handled like a normal attack
(although bonuses for a rear attack still apply). Opponents in battle
will often notice a thief trying to maneuver behind them--the first
rule of fighting is to never turn your back on an enemy! However,
someone who isn't expecting to be attacked (a friend or ally,
perhaps) can be caught unaware even if he knows the thief is behind
him.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The multiplier given in Table
30 applies to the amount of damage before modifiers for Strength or
weapon bonuses are added. The weapon's standard damage is multiplied
by the value given in Table 30. Then Strength and magical weapon
bonuses are added.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Backstabbing does have
limitations. First, the damage multiplier applies only to the first
attack made by the thief, even if multiple attacks are possible. Once
a blow is struck, the initial surprise effect is lost. Second, the
thief cannot use it on every creature. The victim must be generally
humanoid. Part of the skill comes from knowing just where to strike.
A thief could backstab an ogre, but he wouldn't be able to do the
same to a beholder. The victim must also have a definable back (which
leaves out most slimes, jellies, oozes, and the like). Finally, the
thief has to be able to reach a significant target area. To backstab
a giant, the thief would have to be standing on a ledge or window
balcony. Backstabbing him in the ankle just isn't going to be as
effective.</font></p>

Cant:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Thieves' cant is
a special form of communication known by all thieves and their
associates. It is not a distinct language; it consists of slang words
and implied meanings that can be worked into any language. The
vocabulary of thieves' cant limits its use to discussing things that
interest thieves: stolen loot, easy marks, breaking and entering,
mugging, confidence games, and the like. It is not a language,
however. Two thieves cannot communicate via thieves' cant unless they
know a common language. The cant is useful, however, for identifying
fellow cads and bounders by slipping a few tidbits of lingo into a
normal conversation.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The concept of thieves' cant
is historical (the cant probably is still used today in one form or
another), although in the AD&amp;D game it has an ahistorically broad
base. A few hours of research at a large library should turn up
actual examples of old thieves' cant for those who want to learn more
about the subject.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Use
Scrolls:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">At 10th level, a
thief gains a limited ability to use magical and priest scrolls. A
thief's understanding of magical writings is far from complete,
however. The thief has a 25% chance to read the scroll incorrectly
and reverse the spell's effect. This sort of malfunction is almost
always detrimental to the thief and his party. It could be as simple
as accidentally casting the reverse of the given spell or as complex
as a foul-up on a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>fireball</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
scroll, causing the ball of flame to be centered on the thief instead
of its intended target. The exact effect is up to the DM (this is the
sort of thing DMs enjoy, so expect the unexpected).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thieves do not build castles
or fortresses in the usual sense. Instead, they favor small,
fortified dwellings, especially if the true purpose of the buildings
can easily be disguised. A thief might, for example, construct a
well-protected den in a large city behind the facade of a seedy
tavern or old warehouse. Naturally, the true nature of the place will
be a closely guarded secret! Thieves almost always build their
strongholds in or near cities, since that is where they ply their
trades most lucratively.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This, of course, assumes that
the thief is interested in operating a band of thieves out of his
stronghold. Not all thieves have larceny in their hearts, however. If
a character devoted his life to those aspects of thieving that focus
on scouting, stealth, and the intricacies of locks and traps, he
could build an entirely different sort of stronghold--one filled with
the unusual and intriguing objects he has collected during his
adventurous life. Like any thief's home, it should blend in with its
surroundings; after all, a scout never advertises his whereabouts. It
might be a formidable maze of rooms, secret passages, sliding panels,
and mysterious paraphernalia from across the world.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once a thief reaches 10th
level, his reputation is such that he can attract followers -- either
a gang of scoundrels and scalawags or a group of scouts eager to
learn from a reputed master. The thief attracts 4d6 of these fellows.
They are generally loyal to him, but a wise thief is always
suspicious of his comrades. Table 31 can be used to determine the
type and level of followers, or the DM can choose followers
appropriate to his campaign.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The bard is an optional
character class that can be used if your DM allows. He makes his way
in life by his charm, talent, and wit. A good bard should be glib of
tongue, light of heart, and fleet of foot (when all else fails).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In precise historical terms,
the title &quot;bard&quot; applies only to certain groups of Celtic
poets who sang the history of their tribes in long, recitative poems.
These bards, found mainly in Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, filled
many important roles in their society. They were storehouses of
tribal history, reporters of news, messengers, and even ambassadors
to other tribes. However, in the AD&amp;D game, the bard is a more
generalized character. Historical and legendary examples of the type
include Alan-a-Dale, Will Scarlet, Amergin, and even Homer. Indeed,
every culture has its storyteller or poet, whether he is called bard,
skald, fili, jongleur, or something else.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To become a bard, a character
must have a Dexterity of 12 or more, an Intelligence of 13 or more,
and a Charisma of 15 or more. The prime requisites are Dexterity and
Charisma. A bard can be lawful, neutral or chaotic, good or evil, but
must always be partially neutral. Only by retaining some amount of
detachment can he successfully fulfill his role as a bard.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A bard, by his nature, tends
to learn many different skills. He is a jack-of-all-trades but master
of none. Although he fights as a rogue, he can use any weapon. He can
wear any armor up to, and including, chain mail, but he cannot use a
shield.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All bards are proficient
singers, chanters, or vocalists and can play a musical instrument of
the player's choice (preferably one that is portable). Additional
instruments can be learned if the optional proficiency rules are used
-- the bard can learn two instruments for every proficiency slot
spent.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In his travels, a bard also
manages to learn a few wizard spells. Like a wizard, a bard's
Intelligence determines the number of spells he can know and the
chance to know any given spell. These he keeps in his spell book,
abiding by all the restrictions on memorization and spell use that
bind a wizard, especially in the prohibition of armor. Hence, a bard
will tend to use his spells more to entertain and impress than to
fight. Table 32 lists the number of spells a bard can cast at each
level.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Since bards are dabblers
rather than full-time wizards, their spells tend to be gained by
serendipity and happenstance. In no case can a bard choose to
specialize in a school of magic. Beginning bards do not have a
selection of spells. A 2nd-level bard begins with one to four spells,
chosen either randomly or by the DM. (An Intelligence check must
still be made to see if the bard can learn a given spell.) The bard
is not guaranteed to know </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>read
magic,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> as this is
not needed to read the writings in a spell book. The bard can add new
spells to his spell book as he finds them, but he does not
automatically gain additional spells as he advances in level. All
spells beyond those he starts with must be found during the course of
adventuring. The bard's casting level is equal to his current level.</font></p>

relying on words and phrases they have picked up in their studies and
travels. The Read Languages column in Table 33 gives the base
percentage chance to puzzle out a foreign tongue. It also represents
the degree of comprehension the bard has if he is successful. The DM
can rule that a language is too rare or unfamiliar, especially if it
has never been previously encountered by the bard, effectively
foiling his attempts to translate it. At the other extreme, the bard
need not make the dice roll for any language he is proficient in.
Success is assumed to be automatic in such cases.</font></p>

intending to attack in just seconds), the bard can try to alter the
mood of the listeners. He can try to soften their mood or make it
uglier. The method can be whatever is most suitable to the situation
at the moment -- a fiery speech, collection of jokes, a sad tale, a
fine tune played on a fiddle, a haunting lute melody, or a heroic
song from the old homeland. Everyone in the group listening must roll
a saving throw vs. paralyzation (if the crowd is large, make saving
throws for groups of people using average hit dice). The die roll is
modified by -1 for every three experience levels of the bard (round
fractions down). If the saving throw fails, the group's reaction can
be shifted one level (see the Reactions section in the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>DMG</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">),

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>	Cwell the Fine has been
captured by a group of bandits and hauled into their camp. Although
they are not planning to kill him on the spot, any fool can plainly
see that his future may be depressingly short. In desperation, Cwell
begins spinning a comic tale about Duke Dunderhead and his blundering
knights. It has always been a hit with the peasants, and he figures
it's worth a try here. Most of the bandits have 1 Hit Die, but the
few higher level leaders raise the average level to 3. Cwell is only
2nd level so he gains no modifier. A saving throw is rolled and the
group fails (Cwell succeeds!). The ruffians find his tale amusing.
The player shifts their reaction from hostile to neutral. The bandits
decide not to kill Cwell but to keep him around, under guard, to
entertain them. If the bandits' saving throw had succeeded, the
bandits would have been offended by the story (perhaps some of them
served under Duke Dunderhead!), and their reaction would have shifted
from hostile to violent. They probably would have roasted Cwell
immediately.</i></font></p>

were attacking his group, the bandits would have quickly decided that
Cwell was a fool and carried on with their business. Furthermore, the
form of entertainment used must be appropriate to the audience. Cwell
might be able to calm (or enrage) a bear with music, but he won't

to attack rolls, or a +1 bonus to saving throws, or a +2 bonus to
morale (particularly useful in large battles) to those involved in
melee. The bard must spend at least three full rounds singing or
reciting before the battle begins. This affects those within a range
of 10 feet per experience level of the bard.</font></p>

a fierce fight, they retreat and the enemy does not pursue. Cwell,
seeing them crestfallen and dispirited, once again rouses their will
to fight. Reinvigorated, they charge back into battle with renewed

ruined. Success is checked by having the bard make a saving throw vs.
spell. Success blocks the attack, failure means the attack has its
normal effect (everyone affected rolls saving throws, normal damage
is inflicted, etc.). The bard can use this ability once per encounter

any written item he uses is read incorrectly. When this happens, the
magical power works the opposite of what is intended, generally to
the detriment of the bard or his friends. The DM will tell you what
happens to your character, based on the situation and particular

are the average of all his Hit Dice rolls. When the character is
first created, the player rolls hit points for each class separately,
totals them up, then divides by the number of dice rolled (round
fractions down). Any Constitution bonus is then added to the
character's hit points. If one of the character's classes is fighter
and he has a Constitution of 17 or 18, then he gains the +3 or +4
Constitution bonus available only to warriors (instead of the +2
maximum available to the other character classes).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Later the character is likely
to gain levels in different classes at different times. When this
happens, roll the appropriate Hit Die and divide the result by the
number of classes the character has (round fractions down, but a Hit
Die never yields less than 1 hit point). The character's Constitution
bonus is split between his classes; thus, a fighter/mage gets ½ of
his Con bonus when he goes up a level as a fighter and the other ½
of the Con bonus when he goes up a level as a mage. A
fighter/mage/thief would get 1/3 of his bonus when he goes up as a
fighter, 1/3 when he goes up as a mage, and the other 1/3 when he
goes up as a thief.</font></p>

switches to. The character selects one class to begin his adventuring
life. He can advance in this class as many levels as he desires
before switching to another class; there is no cut-off point beyond
which a character cannot switch. However, he must attain at least 2nd
level in his current class before changing to another class. There is
no limit to the number of classes a character can acquire, as long as

After switching to a new class, the character no longer earns
experience points in his previous character class and he can no
longer advance in level in that class. Nor can he switch back to his
first class at a later date, hoping to resume his advancement where
he left off. Once he leaves a class he has finished his studies in
it. Instead, he starts over in a new class, at 1st level with 0
experience points, but he does retain his previous Hit Dice and hit
points. He gains the abilities, and must abide by all of the
restrictions, of the new class. He does not gain or lose any points
on his ability scores (for example, an 18 Strength wizard who changes
to fighter does not gain the percentile Strength bonus, but likewise
a fighter changing to a wizard would not lose it). The character uses
the combat and saving throw tables appropriate to his new class and
level.</font></p>

numbers, weapons or armor that are now prohibited, and any special
abilities of the old class that are not also abilities of the new
class. (The character is trying to learn new ways to do things; by
slipping back to his old methods, he has set back his learning in his

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Characters who believe in law
maintain that order, organization, and society are important, indeed
vital, forces of the universe. The relationships between people and
governments exist naturally. Lawful philosophers maintain that this
order is not created by man but is a natural law of the universe.
Although man does not create orderly structures, it is his obligation
to function within them, lest the fabric of everything crumble. For
less philosophical types, lawfulness manifests itself in the belief
that laws should be made and followed, if only to have understandable
rules for society. People should not pursue personal vendettas, for
example, but should present their claims to the proper authorities.
Strength comes through unity of action, as can be seen in guilds,
empires, and powerful churches.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Those espousing neutrality
tend to take a more balanced view of things. They hold that for every
force in the universe, there is an opposite force somewhere. Where
there is lawfulness, there is also chaos; where there is neutrality,
there is also partisanship. The same is true of good and evil, life
and death. What is important is that all these forces remain in
balance with each other. If one factor becomes ascendant over its
opposite, the universe becomes unbalanced. If enough of these
polarities go out of balance, the fabric of reality could pull itself
apart. For example, if death became ascendant over life, the universe
would become a barren wasteland.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Philosophers of neutrality
not only presuppose the existence of opposites, but they also
theorize that the universe would vanish should one opposite
completely destroy the other (since nothing can exist without its
opposite). Fortunately for these philosophers (and all sentient
life), the universe seems to be efficient at regulating itself. Only
when a powerful, unbalancing force appears (which almost never
happens) need the defenders of neutrality become seriously concerned.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The believers in chaos hold
that there is no preordained order or careful balance of forces in
the universe. Instead they see the universe as a collection of things
and events, some related to each other and others completely
independent. They tend to hold that individual actions account for
the differences in things and that events in one area do not alter
the fabric of the universe halfway across the galaxy. Chaotic
philosophers believe in the power of the individual over his own
destiny and are fond of anarchistic nations. Being more pragmatic,
non-philosophers recognize the function of society in protecting
their individual rights. Chaotics can be hard to govern as a group,
since they place their own needs and desires above those of society.</font></p>

<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Good,
Neutrality, and Evil </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Like law and order, the second
set of attitudes is also divided into three parts. These parts
describe, more or less, a character's moral outlook; they are his
internal guideposts to what is right or wrong.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Good characters are just
that. They try to be honest, charitable, and forthright. People are
not perfect, however, so few are good all the time. There are always
occasional failings and weaknesses. A good person, however, worries
about his errors and normally tries to correct any damage done.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Remember, however, that
goodness has no absolute values. Although many things are commonly
accepted as good (helping those in need, protecting the weak),
different cultures impose their own interpretations on what is good
and what is evil.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Those with a neutral moral
stance often refrain from passing judgment on anything. They do not
classify people, things, or events as good or evil; what is, is. In
some cases, this is because the creature lacks the capacity to make a
moral judgment (animals fall into this category). Few normal
creatures do anything for good or evil reasons. They kill because
they are hungry or threatened. They sleep where they find shelter.
They do not worry about the moral consequences of their
actions--their actions are instinctive.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Evil is the antithesis of
good and appears in many ways, some overt and others quite subtle.
Only a few people of evil nature actively seek to cause harm or
destruction. Most simply do not recognize that what they do is
destructive or disruptive. People and things that obstruct the evil
character's plans are mere hindrances that must be overcome. If
someone is harmed in the process . . . well, that's too bad. Remember
that evil, like good, is interpreted differently in different
societies.</font></p>

Combinations </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Nine different alignments
result from combining these two sets. Each alignment varies from all
others, sometimes in broad, obvious ways, and sometimes in subtle
ways. Each alignment is described in the following paragraphs.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Lawful
Good:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Characters of
this alignment believe that an orderly, strong society with a
well-organized government can work to make life better for the
majority of the people. To ensure the quality of life, laws must be
created and obeyed. When people respect the laws and try to help one
another, society as a whole prospers. Therefore, lawful good
characters strive for those things that will bring the greatest
benefit to the most people and cause the least harm. An honest and
hard-working serf, a kindly and wise king, or a stern but forthright
minister of justice are all examples of lawful good people.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Order and
organization are of paramount importance to characters of this
alignment. They believe in a strong, well-ordered government, whether
that government is a tyranny or benevolent democracy. The benefits of
organization and regimentation outweigh any moral questions raised by
their actions. An inquisitor determined to ferret out traitors at any
cost or a soldier who never questions his orders are good examples of
lawful neutral behavior.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">These characters
believe in using society and its laws to benefit themselves.
Structure and organization elevate those who deserve to rule as well
as provide a clearly defined hierarchy between master and servant. To
this end, lawful evil characters support laws and societies that
protect their own concerns. If someone is hurt or suffers because of
a law that benefits lawful evil characters, too bad. Lawful evil
characters obey laws out of fear of punishment. Because they may be
forced to honor an unfavorable contract or oath they have made,
lawful evil characters are usually very careful about giving their
word. Once given, they break their word only if they can find a way
to do it legally, within the laws of the society. An iron-fisted
tyrant and a devious, greedy merchant are examples of lawful evil
beings.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">These characters
believe that a balance of forces is important, but that the concerns
of law and chaos do not moderate the need for good. Since the
universe is vast and contains many creatures striving for different
goals, a determined pursuit of good will not upset the balance; it
may even maintain it. If fostering good means supporting organized
society, then that is what must be done. If good can only come about
through the overthrow of existing social order, so be it. Social
structure itself has no innate value to them. A baron who violates
the orders of his king to destroy something he sees as evil is an
example of a neutral good character.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">True neutral
characters believe in the ultimate balance of forces, and they refuse
to see actions as either good or evil. Since the majority of people
in the world make judgments, true neutral characters are extremely
rare. True neutrals do their best to avoid siding with the forces of
either good or evil, law or chaos. It is their duty to see that all
of these forces remain in balanced contention.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	True neutral characters
sometimes find themselves forced into rather peculiar alliances. To a
great extent, they are compelled to side with the underdog in any
given situation, sometimes even changing sides as the previous loser
becomes the winner. A true neutral druid might join the local barony
to put down a tribe of evil gnolls, only to drop out or switch sides
when the gnolls were brought to the brink of destruction. He would
seek to prevent either side from becoming too powerful. Clearly,
there are very few true neutral characters in the world.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Neutral evil
characters are primarily concerned with themselves and their own
advancement. They have no particular objection to working with others
or, for that matter, going it on their own. Their only interest is in
getting ahead. If there is a quick and easy way to gain a profit,
whether it be legal, questionable, or obviously illegal, they take
advantage of it. Although neutral evil characters do not have the
every-man-for-himself attitude of chaotic characters, they have no
qualms about betraying their friends and companions for personal
gain. They typically base their allegiance on power and money, which
makes them quite receptive to bribes. An unscrupulous mercenary, a
common thief, and a double-crossing informer who betrays people to
the authorities to protect and advance himself are typical examples
of neutral evil characters.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Chaotic good
characters are strong individualists marked by a streak of kindness
and benevolence. They believe in all the virtues of goodness and
right, but they have little use for laws and regulations. They have
no use for people who &quot;try to push folk around and tell them
what to do.&quot; Their actions are guided by their own moral compass
which, although good, may not always be in perfect agreement with the
rest of society. A brave frontiersman forever moving on as settlers
follow in his wake is an example of a chaotic good character.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Chaotic neutral
characters believe that there is no order to anything, including
their own actions. With this as a guiding principle, they tend to
follow whatever whim strikes them at the moment. Good and evil are
irrelevant when making a decision. Chaotic neutral characters are
extremely difficult to deal with. Such characters have been known to
cheerfully and for no apparent purpose gamble away everything they
have on the roll of a single die. They are almost totally unreliable.
In fact, the only reliable thing about them is that they cannot be
relied upon! This alignment is perhaps the most difficult to play.
Lunatics and madmen tend toward chaotic neutral behavior.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">These characters
are the bane of all that is good and organized. Chaotic evil
characters are motivated by the desire for personal gain and
pleasure. They see absolutely nothing wrong with taking whatever they
want by whatever means possible. Laws and governments are the tools
of weaklings unable to fend for themselves. The strong have the right
to take what they want, and the weak are there to be exploited. When
chaotic evil characters band together, they are not motivated by a
desire to cooperate, but rather to oppose powerful enemies. Such a
group can be held together only by a strong leader capable of
bullying his underlings into obedience. Since leadership is based on
raw power, a leader is likely to be replaced at the first sign of
weakness by anyone who can take his position away from him by any
method. Bloodthirsty buccaneers and monsters of low Intelligence are
fine examples of chaotic evil personalities.</font></p>

Creatures </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition to the alignments
above, some things--particularly unintelligent monsters (killer
plants, etc.) and animals--never bother with moral and ethical
concerns. For these creatures, alignment is simply not applicable. A
dog, even a well-trained one, is neither good nor evil, lawful nor
chaotic. It is simply a dog. For these creatures, alignment is always
detected as neutral.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Playing
the Character's Alignment </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Aside from a few minimal
restrictions required for some character classes, a player is free to
choose whatever alignment he wants for his character. However, before
rushing off and selecting an alignment, there are a few things to
consider.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	First, alignment is an aid to
role-playing and should be used that way. Don't choose an alignment
that will be hard to role play or that won't be fun. A player who
chooses an unappealing alignment probably will wind up playing a
different alignment anyway. In that case, he might as well have
chosen the second alignment to begin with. A player who thinks that
lawful good characters are boring goody-two-shoes who don't get to
have any fun should play a chaotic good character instead. On the
other hand, a player who thinks that properly role-playing a heroic,
lawful good fighter would be an interesting challenge is encouraged
to try it. No one should be afraid to stretch his imagination.
Remember, selecting an alignment is a way of saying, &quot;My
character is going to act like a person who believes this.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Second, the game revolves
around cooperation among everyone in the group. The character who
tries to go it alone or gets everyone angry at him is likely to have
a short career. Always consider the alignments of other characters in
the group. Certain combinations, particularly lawful good and any
sort of evil, are explosive. Sooner or later the group will find
itself spending more time arguing than adventuring. Some of this is
unavoidable (and occasionally amusing), but too much is ultimately
destructive. As the players argue, they get angry. As they get angry,
their characters begin fighting among themselves. As the characters
fight, the players continue to get more angry. Once anger and
hostility take over a game, no one has fun. And what's the point of
playing a game if the players don't have fun?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Third, some people choose to
play evil alignments. Although there is no specific prohibition
against this, there are several reasons why it is not a good idea.
First, the AD&amp;D game is a game of heroic fantasy. What is heroic
about being a villain? If an evilly aligned group plays its alignment
correctly, it is as much a battle for the characters to work together
as it is to take on the outside world. Neutral evil individuals would
be paranoid (with some justification) that the others would betray
them for profit or self-aggrandizement. Chaotic evil characters would
try to get someone else to take all the risks so that they could
become (or remain) strong and take over. Although lawful evil
characters might have some code of conduct that governed their party,
each member would look for ways to twist the rules to his own favor.
A group of players who play a harmonious party of evil characters
simply are not playing their alignments correctly. By its nature,
evil alignments call for disharmony and squabbling, which destroys
the fun.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Imagine how groups of
different alignments might seek to divide a treasure trove. Suppose
the adventuring party contains one character of each alignment (a
virtually impossible situation, but useful for illustration). Each is
then allowed to present his argument:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The lawful good character
says, &quot;Before we went on this adventure, we agreed to split the
treasure equally, and that's what we're going to do. First, we'll
deduct the costs of the adventure and pay for the resurrection of
those who have fallen, since we're sharing all this equally. If
someone can't be raised, then his share goes to his family.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Since we agreed to
split equally, that's fine,&quot; replies the lawful evil character
thoughtfully. &quot;But there was nothing in this deal about paying
for anyone else's expenses. It's not my fault if you spent a lot on
equipment! Furthermore, this deal applies only to the surviving
partners; I don't remember anything about dead partners. I'm not
setting aside any money to raise that klutz. He's someone else's
problem.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Flourishing a sheet of paper,
the lawful neutral character breaks in. &quot;It's a good thing for
you two that I've got things together, nice and organized. I had the
foresight to write down the exact terms of our agreement, and we're
all going to follow them.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The neutral good character
balances the issues and decides, &quot;I'm in favor of equal
shares--that keeps everybody happy. I feel that expenses are each
adventurer's own business: If someone spent too much, then he should
be more careful next time. But raising fallen comrades seems like a
good idea, so I say we set aside money to do that.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After listening to the above
arguments, the true neutral character decides not to say anything
yet. He's not particularly concerned with any choice. If the issue
can be solved without his becoming involved, great. But if it looks
like one person is going to get everything, that's when he'll step in
and cast his vote for a more balanced distribution.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The neutral evil character
died during the adventure, so he doesn't have anything to say.
However, if he could make his opinion known, he would gladly argue
that the group ought to pay for raising him and set aside a share for
him. The neutral evil character would also hope that the group
doesn't discover the big gem he secretly pocketed during one of the
encounters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The chaotic good character
objects to the whole business. &quot;Look, it's obvious that the
original agreement is messed up. I say we scrap it and reward people
for what they did. I saw some of you hiding in the background when
the rest of us were doing all the real fighting. I don't see why
anyone should be rewarded for being a coward! As far as raising dead
partners, I say that's a matter of personal choice. I don't mind
chipping in for some of them, but I don't think I want everyone back
in the group.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Outraged at the totally true
but tactless accusation of cowardice, the chaotic evil character
snaps back, &quot;Look, I was doing an important job, guarding the
rear! Can I help it if nothing tried to sneak up behind us? Now, it
seems to me that all of you are pretty beat up--and I'm not. So, I
don't think there's going to be too much objection if I take all the
jewelry and that wand. And I'll take anything interesting those two
dead guys have. Now, you can either work with me and do what I say or
get lost--permanently!&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The chaotic neutral character
is also dead (after he tried to charge a gorgon), so he doesn't
contribute to the argument. However, if he were alive, he would join
forces with whichever side appealed to him the most at the moment. If
he couldn't decide he'd flip a coin.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Clearly, widely diverse
alignments in a group can make even the simplest task impossible. It
is almost certain that the group in the example would come to blows
before they could reach a decision. But dividing cash is not the only
instance in which this group would have problems. Consider the battle
in which they gained the treasure in the first place.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Upon penetrating the heart of
the ruined castle, the party met its foe, a powerful gorgon commanded
by a mad warrior. There, chained behind the two, was a helpless
peasant kidnapped from a nearby village.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The lawful good character
unhesitatingly (but not foolishly) entered the battle; it was the
right thing to do. He considered it his duty to protect the
villagers. Besides, he could not abandon an innocent hostage to such
fiends. He was willing to fight until he won or was dragged off by
his friends. He had no intention of fighting to his own death, but he
would not give up until he had tried his utmost to defeat the evil
creatures.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The lawful evil character
also entered the battle willingly. Although he cared nothing for the
peasant, he could not allow the two fiends to mock him. Still, there
was no reason for him to risk all for one peasant. If forced to
retreat, he could return with a stronger force, capture the
criminals, and execute them publicly. If the peasant died in the
meantime, their punishment would be that much more horrible.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The lawful neutral character
was willing to fight, because the villains threatened public order.
However, he was not willing to risk his own life. He would have
preferred to come back later with reinforcements. If the peasant
could be saved, that is good, because he is part of the community. If
not, it would be unfortunate but unavoidable.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The neutral good character
did not fight the gorgon or the warrior, but he tried to rescue the
peasant. Saving the peasant was worthwhile, but there was no need to
risk injury and death along the way. Thus, while the enemy was
distracted in combat, he tried to slip past and free the peasant.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The true neutral character
weighed the situation carefully. Although it looked like the forces
working for order would have the upper hand in the battle, he knew
there had been a general trend toward chaos and destruction in the
region that must be combatted. He tried to help, but if the group
failed, he could work to restore the balance of law and chaos
elsewhere in the kingdom.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The neutral evil character
cared nothing about law, order, or the poor peasant. He figured that
there had to be some treasure around somewhere. After all, the
villain's lair had once been a powerful temple. He could poke around
for cash while the others did the real work. If the group got into
real trouble and it looked like the villains would attack him, then
he would fight. Unfortunately, a stray magical arrow killed him just
after he found a large gem.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The chaotic good character
joined the fight for several reasons. Several people in the group
were his friends, and he wanted to fight at their sides. Furthermore,
the poor, kidnapped peasant deserved to be rescued. Thus, the chaotic
good character fought to aid his companions and save the peasant. He
didn't care if the villains were killed, captured, or just driven
away. Their attacks against the village didn't concern him.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The chaotic neutral character
decided to charge, screaming bloodthirsty cries, straight for the
gorgon. Who knows? He might have broken its nerve and thrown it off
guard. He discovered that his plan was a bad one when the gorgon's
breath killed him.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The chaotic evil character
saw no point in risking his hide for the villagers, the peasant, or
the rest of the party. In fact, he thought of several good reasons
not to. If the party was weakened, he might be able to take over. If
the villains won, he could probably make a deal with them and join
their side. If everyone was killed, he could take everything he
wanted and leave. All these sounded a lot better than getting hurt
for little or no gain. So he stayed near the back of the battle,
watching. If anyone asked, he could say he was watching the rear,
making sure no one came to aid the enemy.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The two preceding examples of
alignment are extreme situations. It's not very likely that a player
will ever play in a group of alignments as varied as those given
here. If such a group ever does form, players should seriously
reconsider the alignments of the different members of the party! More
often, the adventuring party will consist of characters with
relatively compatible alignments. Even then, players who role-play
their characters' alignment will discover small issues of
disagreement.</font></p>

<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Changing
Alignment </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Alignment is a tool, not a
straitjacket. It is possible for a player to change his character's
alignment after the character is created, either by action or choice.
However, changing alignment is not without its penalties.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Most often the character's
alignment will change because his actions are more in line with a
different alignment. This can happen if the player is not paying
attention to the character and his actions. The character gradually
assumes a different alignment. For example, a lawful good fighter
ignores the village council's plea for help because he wants to go
fight evil elsewhere. This action is much closer to chaotic good,
since the character is placing his desire over the need of the
community. The fighter would find himself beginning to drift toward
chaotic good alignment.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All people have minor
failings, however, so the character does not instantly become chaotic
good. Several occasions of lax behavior are required before the
character's alignment changes officially. During that time, extremely
lawful good activities can swing the balance back. Although the
player may have a good idea of where the character's alignment lies,
only the DM knows for sure.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Likewise, the character
cannot wake up one morning and say, &quot;I think I'll become lawful
good today.&quot; (Well, he can say it, but it won't have any
effect.) A player can choose to change his character's alignment, but
this change is accomplished by deeds, not words. Tell the DM of the
intention and then try to play according to the new choice.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, there are many
magical effects that can change a character's alignment. Rare and
cursed magical items can instantly alter a character's alignment.
Powerful artifacts may slowly erode a character's determination and
willpower, causing subtle shifts in behavior. Spells can compel a
character to perform actions against his will. Although all of these
have an effect, none are as permanent or damaging as those choices
the character makes of his own free will.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Changing the way a character
behaves and thinks will cost him experience points and slow his
advancement. Part of a character's experience comes from learning how
his own behavior affects him and the world around him. In real life,
for example, a person learns that he doesn't like horror movies only
by going to see a few of them. Based on that experience, he learns to
avoid certain types of movies. Changing behavior means discarding
things the character learned previously. Relearning things takes
time. This costs the character experience.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are other, more
immediate effects of changing alignment. Certain character classes
require specific alignments. A paladin who is no longer lawful good
is no longer a paladin. A character may have magical items usable
only to specific alignments (intelligent swords, etc.). Such items
don't function (and may even prove dangerous) in the hands of a
differently aligned character.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	News of a character's change
in behavior will certainly get around to friends and acquaintances.
Although some people he never considered friendly may now warm to
him, others may take exception to his new attitudes. A few may even
try to help him &quot;see the error of his ways.&quot; The local
clergy, on whom he relies for healing, may look askance on his recent
behavior, denying him their special services (while at the same time
sermonizing on his plight). The character who changes alignment often
finds himself unpopular, depending on the attitudes of the
surrounding people. People do not understand him. If the character
drifts into chaotic neutral behavior in a highly lawful city, the
townspeople might decide that the character is afflicted and needs
close supervision, even confinement, for his own good!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Ultimately, the player is
advised to pick an alignment he can play comfortably, one that fits
in with those of the rest of the group, and he should stay with that
alignment for the course of the character's career. There will be
times when the DM, especially if he is clever, creates situations to
test the character's resolve and ethics. But finding the right course
of action within the character's alignment is part of the fun and
challenge of role-playing.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Most of what a player
character can do is defined by his race, class, and ability scores.
These three characteristics don't cover everything, however.
Characters can have a wide range of talents, from the potent (and
intricate) arts of magic to the simple and mundane knowledge of how
to build a good fire. The character's magical ability (or lack
thereof) is defined by his class. Lesser abilities, such as fire
building, are defined by proficiencies.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A proficiency is a learned
skill that isn't essential to the character's class. A ranger, for
example, may find it useful to know something about navigation,
especially if he lives near an ocean or sea coast. On the other hand,
he isn't likely to suffer if he doesn't know how to navigate; he is a
ranger, not a sailor.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Proficiencies are divided
into two groups: weapon proficiencies (those related to weapons and
combat) and nonweapon proficiencies (those related to everything
else).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All proficiency rules are
additions to the game. Weapon proficiencies are tournament-level
rules, optional in regular play, and nonweapon proficiencies are
completely optional. Proficiencies are not necessary for a balanced
game. They add an additional dimension to characters, however, and
anything that enriches characterization is a bonus. If weapon
proficiencies are used in your game, expect them to apply to all
characters, including NPCs. Nonweapon proficiencies may be used by
players who enjoy them and ignored by those who don't without giving
unfair advantages to anyone (provided your DM allows this; he's the
one who must deal with any problems).</font></p>
<p class="western" >

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Even newly created, 1st-level
characters have proficiencies. The number of proficiency slots that a
character starts with is determined by his group, as shown in Table
34. Each proficiency slot is empty until the player &quot;fills&quot;
it by selecting a proficiency. If your DM allows nonweapon
proficiencies, the character's Intelligence score can modify the
number of slots he has, granting him more proficiencies (see Table
4). In both cases, new proficiencies are learned the same way.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Consider the case of Rath, a
dwarf fighter. Table 34 gives him four weapon proficiency slots (he
is a warrior). If nonweapon proficiencies are used, he has three
slots and his Intelligence of 11 gives him two additional proficiency
slots (according to Table 4) for a total of five nonweapon
proficiency slots. The player must assign weapon or nonweapon
proficiencies to all of these slots before the character goes on his
first adventure. These represent what the character has learned
before beginning his adventuring career.</font></p>

</b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Like all skills and abilities,
proficiencies do not leap unbidden and fully realized into a
character's mind. Instead, a character must train, study, and
practice to learn a new proficiency. However, role-playing the
training time needed to learn a new skill is not much fun. Thus,
there are no training times or study periods associated with any
proficiency. When a character chooses a proficiency, it is assumed
that he had been studying it in his spare time.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Consider just how much spare
time the character has. The player is not role-playing every second
of his character's life. The player may decide to have his character
spend a night in town before setting out on the long journey the next
day. Perhaps the character must wait around for several days while
his companions heal from the last adventure. Or he might spend weeks
on an uneventful ocean voyage. What is he doing during that time?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Among other things, he is
studying whatever new proficiencies he will eventually learn. Using
this &quot;down time&quot; to handle the unexciting aspects of a
role-playing campaign lets players concentrate on more important (or
more interesting) matters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Another part of training is
finding a teacher. Most skills are easier to learn if someone teaches
the character. The DM can handle this in several ways. For those who
like simplicity, ignore the need for teachers--there are self-taught
people everywhere in the world. For those who want more complexity,
make the player characters find someone to teach them any new
proficiency they want to learn. This can be another player character
or an NPC. Although this adds realism, it tends to limit the PC's
adventuring options, especially if he is required to stay in regular
contact with his instructor. Furthermore, most teachers want payment.
While a barter arrangement might be reached, the normal payment is
cash. The actual cost of the service depends on the nature of the
skill, the amount of training desired, the availability of tutors,
the greed of the instructor, and the desire of the DM to remove
excess cash from his campaign.</font></p>

Proficiencies </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A weapon proficiency measures
a character's knowledge and training with a specific weapon. When a
character is created, the player checks Table 34 to see how many
weapon proficiency slots the character has. These initial slots must
be filled immediately, before the character embarks on his first
adventure. Any slots that aren't filled by then are lost.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Each weapon proficiency slot
must be assigned to a particular weapon, not just a class of weapons.
Each weapon listed in Table 44 (Weapons) requires its own
proficiency; each has its own special tricks and quirks that must be
mastered before the weapon can be handled properly and effectively. A
fencer who is master of the epee, for example, is not necessarily
skilled with a saber; the two weapons look similar, but the </font>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">fighting styles they are
designed for are entirely different. A player character could become
proficient with a long bow or a short bow, but not with all bows in
general (unless he devotes a proficiency slot to each individually).
Furthermore, a character can assign weapon proficiency slots only to
those weapons allowed to his character class.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As a character reaches higher
experience levels, he also earns additional weapon proficiencies. The
rate at which proficiencies are gained depends on the character's
class. Warriors, who concentrate on their martial skills, learn to
handle a great number of weapons. They gain weapon proficiencies
quickly. Wizards, who spend their time studying forgotten magical
arts, have little time to practice with weapons. They gain additional
weapon proficiencies very slowly. Multi-class characters can use the
most beneficial line on Table 34 to determine their initial
proficiencies and when they gain new proficiencies.</font></p>

specific weapon proficiency is skilled with that weapon and familiar

eliminates the need to add a modifier to every die roll during
battle.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a character uses a
weapon that he is not proficient with, however, he suffers a penalty
on his chance to hit. The size of this penalty depends on the
character's class. Warriors have the smallest penalty because they
are assumed to have passing familiarity with all weapons. Wizards, by
comparison, are heavily penalized because of their limited study of
weapons. The modifiers for each class (which are taken as penalties
to the attack die roll) are listed on Table 34.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a character gains a
weapon proficiency, he is learning to use a particular weapon
effectively. However, many weapons have similar characteristics. A
long sword, bastard sword, and broad sword, while all different, are
all heavy, slashing swords. A character who is trained with one can
apply some of his skill to the others. He is not fully proficient
with the weapon, but he knows more about it than someone who picks it
up without any skill in similar weapons.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a character uses a
weapon that is similar to a weapon he is proficient with, his attack

-2. A wizard would have a -3 penalty instead of -5.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Knowing how to use a weapon
without embarrassing yourself is very different from being a master
of that weapon. There are warriors, and then there are martial
artists. An Olympic fencer is more than just an athlete; he can do
things with his weapon that astound most fencers.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In the AD&amp;D game, part of
your character's skill is reflected in the bonuses he earns as he
reaches higher levels. As your character advances, he becomes a
wiser, more dangerous fighter. Experience has taught him to
anticipate his opponents and to pounce on any advantage that presents
itself. But this is a general, overall improvement, brought about by
the warrior's sharpening senses and timing. It applies equally to all
types of fighting.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Weapon specialization is an
optional rule that enables a fighter (only) to choose a single weapon
and specialize in its use. Any weapon may be chosen. Specialization
is normally announced (and paid for with weapon proficiency slots)
when the character is created. But even after a player character
earns experience, he can still choose to specialize in a weapon,
provided he has the weapon proficiency slots available.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In one way, a weapon
specialist is like a wizard specialist. The specialization requires a
single-minded dedication and training. Thus, multi-class characters

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Weapon specialization is
obtained by devoting extra weapon proficiency slots to the chosen
weapon. To specialize in any sort of melee weapon or crossbow, the
character must devote two slots--one slot to become proficient with
it, and then a second slot to specialize in it. Any bow (other than a
crossbow) requires a total of three proficiency slots: one for
proficiency and two to specialize. Assume, for the moment, that Rath
the dwarf decided to specialize with the warhammer. Two of his four
proficiency slots are thus devoted to the warhammer. With the two
remaining, he can become proficient with the short sword and short
bow (for example).</font></p>

specialists gain an additional range category: point blank.
Point-blank range for bows is from six feet to 30 feet. Point-blank
range for crossbows is from six feet to 60 feet. At point-blank
range, the character gains a +2 modifier on attack rolls. No
additional damage is caused, but Strength (for bows) and magical
bonuses apply. Furthermore, if the character has an arrow nocked and
drawn, or a bolt loaded and cocked, and has his target in sight, he
can fire at the beginning of the round before any initiative rolls
are made.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Fighters who specialize also

school, were moderately active in after-school programs, and did
fairly well on your grades, the following might be a partial list of
your skills:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	English reading and writing</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Geometry, algebra, and

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Music (playing an instrument,

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Spanish reading and writing
(or French, German, etc.)</font></p>
<p class="western" >

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition to the things
learned in school, you have also learned things from your parents,
friends, scouts, or other groups. You might be able to add any of the
following to your list:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Swimming	Hunting</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Fishing	Canoeing</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sailing	Horseback riding</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	First aid	Animal training</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Cooking	Sewing</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Embroidery	Dancing</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If you consider all your
hobbies and all the things you have done, you probably know many more
skills. In fact, if you make a list, you probably will be surprised
by the large number of basic skills you have. And, at this point, you
are (or were) still young!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now, having graduated from
school, you get a job. Are you just a carpenter, mechanic,
electrician, salesman, or secretary? Of course not; you are a lot
more than just your job. All those things you learned in school and
elsewhere are part of what you are. Shouldn't it be the same for your
player character?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For a really complete
role-playing character, you should know what your character can do.
There are three different ways to do this: using what you know, using
secondary skills, and using nonweapon proficiencies. Each of these is
optional, but each increases the amount of detail that rounds out
your character.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Using
What You Know </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If your DM decides not to use
secondary skills or nonweapon proficiencies, situations will arise in
which you'll have to determine whether your character has certain
skills. For example, Delsenora the wizard slips at the edge of a
steep riverbank and tumbles into the water. The current sweeps her
into the middle of the river. To escape, she must swim to safety. But
does Delsenora know how to swim?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One way to answer this is to
pretend that your character knows most of the things that you know.
Do you know how to swim? If you do, then your character can swim. If
you know a little about mountain climbing, horseback riding,
carpentry, or sewing, your character knows these things, too. This
also applies to things your character might want to build. Perhaps
your character decides he wants to build a catapult. If you can show
your DM how to make such a device, then the DM may allow your
character the same knowledge. Indeed, you might visit the local
library just to gain this information.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are real advantages to
this method. You can learn something at the library or school and
bring it into your game. Also, there are fewer rules to get in the
way of your fun. Since there are fewer rules, your DM has a lot of
flexibility and can play out all the drama inherent in a scene.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are also problems with
this method. First, you probably know a lot of things your character
should not--basic electronics, the components of gunpowder, or
calculus, for instance. You have a lot of knowledge that is just not
available to someone in a medieval world (even a fantasy medieval
world). Likewise, there are things that a typical person in a
medieval world would know that you, as a modern person, have never
needed to learn. Do you know how to make armor? Skin a deer? Salt
meat away for the winter? Turn flax into linen? Thatch a roof? Read
heraldry? You might, but there is no way you can consider these
common skills any more. But in a medieval world they would be common.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Also, knowing something about
a skill or trade doesn't mean you know a lot, and there is a big
difference between the two. When Delsenora fell into the raging
river, she had to swim out. But was she a strong enough swimmer to
pull free of the current? The DM must make up a rule on the spot to
handle the situation. Perhaps you can swim, but can you swim well
enough to escape a raging torrent?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The biggest drawback to this
method is that there are no rules to resolve tricky situations. The
DM must make it up during play. Some players and DMs enjoy doing
this. They think up good answers quickly. Many consider this to be a
large part of the fun. This method is perfect for them, and they
should use it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Other players and DMs like to
have clear rules to prevent arguments. If this is the case in your
group, it is better to use secondary skills or nonweapon
proficiencies.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Secondary
Skills </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The second method for
determining what your character knows is to assign secondary skills.
Secondary skills are broad areas of expertise. Most correspond to
occupations that your character may have been apprenticed in or
otherwise picked up before beginning his adventuring life. Secondary
skills are much more general than nonweapon proficiencies. They
should not be used in combination with nonweapon proficiencies, which
are explained later.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Every player character has a
chance at a secondary skill. Either choose one from Table 36 or take
a chance and roll randomly. A random roll may result in one, two, or
no secondary skills.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once a character has a
secondary skill, it is up to the player and the DM to determine just
what the character can do with it. The items in parentheses after
each skill describe some of the things the character knows. Other
knowledge may be added with the DM's approval. Thus, a hunter might
know the basics of finding food in the wilderness, how to read animal
signs to identify the types of creatures in the area, the habits of
dangerous animals, and how to stalk wild animals.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Like the previous method
(&quot;Using What You Know&quot;), this method has strengths and
weaknesses. Secondary skills do not provide any rules for determining
whether a character succeeds when he uses a skill to do something
difficult. It is safe to assume that simple jobs succeed
automatically. (A hunter could find food for himself without any
difficulty.) For more complicated tasks, the DM must assign a chance
for success. He can assign a percentage chance, have the character
make a saving throw, or require an Ability check (see Glossary). The
DM still has a lot of flexibility.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This flexibility means the DM
must sometimes make up the rule to cover the situation, however. As
mentioned earlier, some DMs enjoy this; others do not, their
strengths being elsewhere. While secondary skills define and limit
the player's options, they do not greatly simplify the DM's job.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Nonweapon
Proficiencies </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The most detailed method for
handling character skills is that of nonweapon proficiencies. These
are much like weapon proficiencies. Each character starts with a
specific number of nonweapon proficiency slots and then earns
additional slots as he advances. Initial slots must be assigned
immediately; they cannot be saved or held in reserve.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Nonweapon proficiencies are
the most detailed way to handle the question of what the player
character knows. They allow the player to choose from a broad
selection and define the effects of each choice. Like the other
methods, however, this system is not without drawbacks. First,
nonweapon proficiencies are rigid. Being so defined, they limit the
options of both the player and DM. At the same time, there will still
be questions unanswered by these proficiencies. Whereas before such
questions were broad, they will now tend to be more precise and
detailed. Secondly, using this system increases the amount of time
needed to create a character. While the end result is a more
complete, well-rounded person, setup time can take up to two or three
hours. Novice players especially may be overwhelmed by the number of
choices and rules.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Unlike weapon proficiencies,
in which some weapons are not available to certain character classes,
all nonweapon proficiencies are available to all characters. Some
nonweapon proficiencies are easier for certain character classes to
learn, however.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Table 37 lists all nonweapon
proficiencies. They are divided into categories that correspond to
character groups. The proficiencies listed under each group can be
learned easily by characters of that group. A fifth
category--&quot;General&quot;--contains proficiencies that can be
learned easily by any character.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Refer to Table 38. When a
player selects a nonweapon proficiency from those categories listed
under &quot;Proficiency Groups&quot; for his character's group, it
requires the number of proficiency slots listed in Table 37. When a
player selects a proficiency from any other category, it requires one
additional proficiency slot beyond the number listed.</font></p>

<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Using
Nonweapon Proficiencies </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a character uses a
proficiency, either the attempt is automatically successful, or the
character must roll a proficiency check. If the task is simple or the
proficiency has only limited game use (such as cobbling or
carpentry), a proficiency check is generally not required. If the
task the character is trying to perform is difficult or subject to
failure, a proficiency check is required. Read the descriptions of
the proficiencies for details about how and when each can be used.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a proficiency check is
required, Table 37 lists which ability is used with each proficiency.
Add the modifier (either positive or negative) listed in Table 37 to
the appropriate ability score. Then the player rolls 1d20. If the
roll is equal to or less than the character's adjusted ability score,
the character accomplished what he was trying to do. If the roll is
greater than the character's ability score, the character fails at
the task. (A roll of 20 </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>always</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
fails.) The DM determines what effects, if any, accompany failure.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of course, to use a
proficiency, the character must have any tools and materials needed
to do the job.    A carpenter can do very little without his
tools, and a smith is virtually helpless without a good forge. The
character must also have enough time to do the job. Certainly,
carpentry proficiency enables your character to build a house, but
not in a single day! Some proficiency descriptions state how much
time is required for certain jobs. Most, however, are left to the
DM's judgment.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM can raise or lower a
character's chance of success if the situation calls for it. Factors
that can affect a proficiency check include availability and quality
of tools, quality of raw material used, time spent doing the job,
difficulty of the job, and how familiar the character is with the
task. A positive modifier is added to the ability score used for the
check. A negative modifier is subtracted from the ability score.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>	Rath, skilled as a
blacksmith, has been making horseshoes for years. Because he is so
familiar with the task and has every tool he needs, the DM lets him
make horseshoes automatically, without risk of failure. However,
Delsenora has persuaded Rath to make an elaborate wrought-iron cage
(she needs it to create a magical item). Rath has never done this
before and the work is very intricate, so the DM imposes a penalty of
-3 on Rath's ability check.</i></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When two proficient
characters work together on the same task, the highest ability score
is used (the one with the greatest chance of success). Furthermore, a
+1 bonus is added for the other character's assistance. The bonus can
never be more than +1, as having too many assistants is sometimes
worse than having none.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Nonweapon proficiencies can
also be improved beyond the ability score the character starts with.
For every additional proficiency slot a character spends on a
nonweapon proficiency, he gains a +1 bonus to those proficiency
checks. Thus, Rath (were he not an adventurer) might spend his
additional proficiency slots on blacksmithing, to become a very good
blacksmith, gaining a +1, +2, +3, or greater bonus to his ability
checks.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Many nonplayer craftsmen are
more accomplished in their fields than player characters, having
devoted all their energies to improving a single proficiency.
Likewise, old masters normally have more talent than young
apprentices--unless the youth has an exceptional ability score!
However, age is no assurance of talent. Remember that knowing a skill
and being good at it are two different things. There are bad potters,
mediocre potters, and true craftsmen. All this has much less to do
with age than with dedication and talent.</font></p>

<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Nonweapon
Proficiency Descriptions </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The following proficiency
descriptions are arranged alphabetically, not according to character
class. Each description gives a general outline of what a character
with the proficiency knows and can do. Furthermore, some descriptions
include rules to cover specific uses or situations, or exact
instructions on the effects of the proficiency.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Agriculture:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The character
has a knowledge of the basics of farming. This includes planting,
harvesting, storing crops, tending animals, butchering, and other
typical farming chores.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Ancient
History:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The character
has learned the legends, lore, and history of some ancient time and
place. The knowledge must be specific, just as a historian would
specialize today in the English Middle Ages, the Italian Renaissance,
or the Roman Republic before Caesar. (The DM either can have ancient
periods in mind for his game or can allow the players to name and
designate them.) Thus, a player character could know details about
the Age of Thorac Dragonking or the Time of the Sea-Raiders or
whatever else was available.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The knowledge acquired gives
the character familiarity with the principal legends, historical
events, characters, locations, battles, breakthroughs (scientific,
cultural, and magical), unsolved mysteries, crafts, and oddities of
the time. The character must roll a proficiency check to identify
places or things he encounters from that age. For example, Rath knows
quite a bit about the Coming of the Trolls, a particularly dark
period of dwarven history. Moving through some deep caverns, he and
his companions stumble across an ancient portal, sealed for untold
ages. Studying the handiwork, he realizes (rolls a successful
proficiency check) that it bears several seals similar to those he
has seen on &quot;banned&quot; portals from the time of Angnar,
doorways to the legendary realm of Trolhel.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Animal
Handling:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Proficiency in
this area enables a character to exercise a greater-than-normal
degree of control over pack animals and beasts of burden. A
successful proficiency check indicates that the character has
succeeded in calming an excited or agitated animal; in contrast, a
character without this proficiency has only a 20% chance of
succeeding in the attempt.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Animal
Lore:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This proficiency
enables a character to observe the actions or habitat of an animal
and interpret what is going on. Actions can show how dangerous the
creature is, whether it is hungry, protecting its young, or defending
a nearby den. Furthermore, careful observation of signs and behaviors
can even indicate the location of a water hole, animal herd,
predator, or impending danger, such as a forest fire. The DM will
secretly roll a proficiency check. A successful check means the
character understood the basic actions of the creature. If the check
fails by 4 or less, no information is gained. If the check fails by 5
or more, the character misinterprets the actions of the animal.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A character may also imitate
the calls and cries of animals that he is reasonably familiar with,
based on his background. This ability is limited by volume. The roar
of a tyrannosaurus rex would be beyond the abilities of a normal
character. A successful proficiency check means that only magical
means can distinguish the character's call from that of the true
animal. The cry is sufficient to fool animals, perhaps frightening
them away or luring them closer. A failed check means the sound is
incorrect in some slight way. A failed call may still fool some
listeners, but creatures very familiar with the cry automatically
detect a false call. All other creatures and characters are allowed a
Wisdom check to detect the fake.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, animal lore
increases the chance of successfully setting snares and traps (for
hunting) since the character knows the general habits of the creature
hunted.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Animal
Training:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Characters with
this proficiency can train one type of creature (declared when the
proficiency is chosen) to obey simple commands and perform tricks. A
character can spend additional proficiencies to train other types of
creatures or can improve his skill with an already chosen type.
Creatures typically trained are dogs, horses, falcons, pigeons,
elephants, ferrets, and parrots. A character can choose even more
exotic creatures and monsters with animal intelligence (although
these are difficult to control).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A trainer can work with up to
three creatures at one time. The trainer may choose to teach general
tasks or specific tricks. A general task gives the creature the
ability to react to a number of nonspecific commands to do its job.
Examples of tasks include guard and attack, carry a rider, perform
heavy labor, hunt, track, or fight alongside soldiers (such as a war
horse or elephant). A specific trick teaches the trained creature to
do one specific action. A horse may rear on command, a falcon may
pluck a designated object, a dog may attack a specific person, or a
rat may run through a particular maze. With enough time, a creature
can be trained to do both general tasks and specific tricks.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Training for a general task
requires three months of uninterrupted work. Training for a specific
trick requires 2d6 weeks. At the end of the training time, a
proficiency check is made. If successful, the animal is trained. If
the die roll fails, the beast is untrainable. An animal can be
trained in 2d4 general tasks or specific tricks, or any combination
of the two.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	An animal trainer can also
try to tame wild animals (preparing them for training later on). Wild
animals can be tamed only when they are very young. The taming
requires one month of uninterrupted work with the creature. At the
end of the month, a proficiency check is made. If successful, the
beast is suitable for training. If the check fails, the creature
retains enough of its wild behavior to make it untrainable. It can be
kept, though it must be leashed or caged.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Appraising:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This proficiency
is highly useful for thieves, as it allows characters to estimate the
value and authenticity of antiques, art objects, jewelry, cut
gemstones, or other crafted items they find (although the DM can
exclude those items too exotic or rare to be well known). The
character must have the item in hand to examine. A successful
proficiency check (rolled by the DM) enables the character to
estimate the value of the item to the nearest 100 or 1,000 gp and to
identify fakes. On a failed check, the character cannot estimate a
price at all. On a roll of 20, the character wildly misreads the
value of the item, always to the detriment of the character.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Armorer:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This character
can make all of the types of armor listed in the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Player's
Handbook,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> given the
proper materials and facilities. When making armor, the proficiency
check is rolled at the end of the normal construction time.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The time required to make
armor is equal to two weeks per level of AC below 10. For example, a
shield would require two weeks of work, whereas a suit of full plate
armor would require 18 weeks of work.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the proficiency check
indicates failure but is within 4 of the amount needed for success,
the armorer has created usable, but flawed, armor. Such armor
functions as 1 AC worse than usual, although it looks like the armor
it was intended to be. Only a character with armorer proficiency can
detect the flaws, and this requires careful and detailed inspection.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the flawed armor is struck
in melee combat with a natural die roll of 19 or 20, it breaks. The
character's AC immediately worsens by 4 additional classes (although
never above 10), and the broken armor hampers the character's
movement. Until the character can remove the broken armor (a process
requiring 1d4 rounds), the character moves at ½ of his normal rate
and suffers a -4 penalty to all of his attack rolls.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If an armorer is creating a
suit of field plate or full plate armor, the character who will use
the armor must be present at least once a week during the creation of
the armor, since such types of armor require very exact fitting.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Artistic
Ability:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Player
characters with artistic ability are naturally accomplished in
various forms of the arts. They have an inherent understanding of
color, form, space, flow, tone, pitch, and rhythm. Characters with
artistic ability must select one art form (painting, sculpture,
composition, etc.) to be proficient in. Thereafter they can attempt
to create art works or musical compositions in their given field.
Although it is not necessary to make a proficiency check, one can be
made to determine the quality of the work. If a 1 is rolled on the
check, the artist has created a work with some truly lasting value.
If the check fails, the artist has created something aesthetically
unpleasing or just plain bad.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Artistic ability also confers
a +1 bonus to all proficiency checks requiring artistic skill--music
or dance--and to attempts to appraise objects of art.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Astrology:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This proficiency
gives the character some understanding of the supposed influences of
the stars. Knowing the birth date and time of any person, the
astrologer can study the stars and celestial events and then prepare
a forecast of the future for that person. The astrologer's insight
into the future is limited to the next 30 days, and his knowledge is
vague at best. If a successful proficiency check is made, the
astrologer can foresee some general event--a great battle, a friend
lost, a new friendship made, etc. The DM decides the exact prediction
(based on his intentions for the next few gaming sessions). Note that
the prediction does not guarantee the result--it only indicates the
potential result. If the proficiency check is failed, no information
is gained unless a 20 is rolled, in which case the prediction is
wildly inaccurate.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Clearly this proficiency
requires preparation and advance knowledge on the part of the DM.
Because of this, it is permissible for the DM to avoid the question,
although this shouldn't be done all the time. Players who want to
make their DM's life easier (always a good idea) should consider
using this proficiency at the end of a gaming session, giving the DM
until the next session to come up with an answer. The DM can use this
proficiency as a catalyst and guide for his adventures--something
that will prompt the player characters to go to certain places or to
try new things.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Characters with the astrology

blacksmithing proficiency is capable of making tools and implements
from iron. Use of the proficiency requires a forge with a coal-fed
fire and bellows, as well as a hammer and anvil. The character cannot
make armor or most weapons, but can craft crowbars, grappling hooks,
horseshoes, nails, hinges, plows, and most other iron objects.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A character with
blind-fighting is skilled at fighting in conditions of poor or no
light (but this proficiency does not allow spell use). In total
darkness, the character suffers only a -2 penalty to his attack roll
(as compared to a -4 penalty without this proficiency). Under
starlight or moonlight, the character incurs only a -1 penalty. The
character suffers no penalties to his AC because of darkness.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, the character
retains special abilities that would normally be lost in darkness,
although the effectiveness of these are reduced by one-half
(proficiency checks are made at half the normal score, etc.). This
proficiency is effective only against opponents or threats within
melee distance of the character. Blind-fighting does not grant any
special protection from missile fire or anything outside the
immediate range of the character's melee weapon. Thus, AC penalties
remain for missile fire. (By the time the character hears the whoosh
of the arrow, for example, it is too late for him to react.)</font></p>

the character to add Strength bonuses to attack and damage rolls.
Additionally, if the proficiency check is a natural 1, the range of
the bow is increased 10 yards for all range classes or is of such

gives the character a basic understanding of the proper forms of
behavior and address required in many different situations,
especially those involving nobility and persons of rank. Thus, the
character will know the correct title to use when addressing a duke,
the proper steps of ceremony to greet visiting diplomats, gestures to
avoid in the presence of dwarves, etc. For extremely unusual
occurrences, a proficiency check must be made for the character to
know the proper etiquette for the situation (an imperial visit, for
example, is a sufficiently rare event).</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, having the character
know what is correct and actually do what is correct are two
different matters. The encounters must still be role-played by the

skilled in the art of fishing, be it with hook and line, net, or
spear. Each hour the character spends fishing, roll a proficiency
check. If the roll is failed, no fish are caught that hour.
Otherwise, a hook and line or a spear will land fish equal to the
difference between the die roll and the character's Wisdom score. A
net will catch three times this amount.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of course, no fish can be
caught where no fish are found. On the other hand, some areas teem

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This proficiency
enables the character to create duplicates of documents and
handwriting and to detect such forgeries created by others. To forge
a document (military orders, local decrees, etc.) where the
handwriting is not specific to a person, the character needs only to
have seen a similar document before. To forge a name, an autograph of
that person is needed, and a proficiency check with a -2 penalty must
be successfully rolled. To forge a longer document written in the
hand of some particular person, a large sample of his handwriting is
needed, with a -3 penalty to the check.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It is important to note that
the forger always </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>thinks</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
he has been successful; the DM rolls the character's proficiency
check in secret and the forger does not learn of a failure until it
is too late.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the check succeeds, the
work will pass examination by all except those intimately familiar
with that handwriting or by those with the forgery proficiency who
examine the document carefully. If the check is failed, the forgery
is detectable to anyone familiar with the type of document or
handwriting--if he examines the document closely. If the die roll is
a 20, the forgery is immediately detectable to anyone who normally
handles such documents without close examination. The forger will not
realize this until too late.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, those with
forgery proficiency may examine a document to learn if it is a
forgery. On a successful proficiency roll, the authenticity of any
document can be ascertained. If the die roll is failed but a 20 is
not rolled, the answer is unknown. If a 20 is rolled, the character
reaches the incorrect conclusion.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The character
knows most common games of chance and skill, including cards, dice,
bones, draughts, and chess. When playing a game, the character may
either play out the actual game (which may take too much time for
some) or make a proficiency check, with success indicating victory.
If two proficient characters play each other, the one with the
highest successful die roll wins. A character with gaming proficiency
can also attempt to cheat, thus gaining a +1 bonus to his ability
score. If the proficiency check for the game is 17 to 20, however,
the character has been caught cheating (even if he won the game).</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A character with
this proficiency can finish the rough gems that are discovered
through mining at a rate of 1d10 stones per day. A gem cutter derives
no benefit from the assistance of nonproficient characters. A gem
cutter must work with a good light source and must have an assortment
of chisels, small hammers, and specially hardened blades.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Uncut gems, while still of
value, are not nearly as valuable as the finished product. If the
cutting is successful (as determined by a proficiency check), the gem
cutter increases the value of a given stone to the range appropriate
for its type. If a 1 is rolled, the work is exceptionally brilliant
and the value of the gem falls into the range for the next most
valuable gem (the DM has the relevant tables).</font></p>

  </font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A character
proficient in healing knows how to use natural medicines and basic
principles of first aid and doctoring. If the character tends another
within one round of wounding (and makes a successful proficiency
check), his ministrations restore 1d3 hit points (but no more hit
points can be restored than were lost in the previous round). Only
one healing attempt can be made on a character per day.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a wounded character
remains under the care of someone with healing proficiency, that
character can recover lost hit points at the rate of 1 per day even
when traveling or engaging in nonstrenuous activity. If the wounded
character gets complete rest, he can recover 2 hit points per day
while under such care. Only characters with both healing and
herbalism proficiencies can help others recover at the rate of 3 hit
points per day of rest. This care does not require a proficiency
check, only the regular attention of the proficient character. Up to
six patients can be cared for at any time.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A character with healing
proficiency can also attempt to aid a poisoned individual, provided
the poison entered through a wound. If the poisoned character can be
tended to immediately (the round after the character is poisoned) and
the care continues for the next five rounds, the victim gains a +2
bonus to his saving throw (delay his saving throw until the last
round of tending). No proficiency check is required, but the poisoned
character must be tended to immediately (normally by sacrificing any
other action by the proficient character) and cannot do anything
himself. If the care and rest are interrupted, the poisoned character
must immediately roll a normal saving throw for the poison. This
result is unalterable by normal means (i.e., more healing doesn't
help). Only characters with both healing and herbalism proficiencies
can attempt the same treatment for poisons the victim has swallowed
or touched (the character uses his healing to diagnose the poison and
his herbalist knowledge to prepare a purgative).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A character with healing
proficiency can also attempt to diagnose and treat diseases. When
dealing with normal diseases, a successful proficiency check
automatically reduces the disease to its mildest form and shortest
duration. Those who also have herbalism knowledge gain an additional
+2 bonus to this check. A proficient character can also attempt to
deal with magical diseases, whether caused by spells or creatures. In
this case, a successful proficiency check diagnoses the cause of the
disease. However, since the disease is magical in nature, it can be
treated only by magical means.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The knowledge of
heraldry enables the character to identify the different crests and
symbols that denote different persons and groups. Heraldry comes in
many forms and is used for many different purposes. It can be used to
identify noblemen, families, guilds, sects, legions, political
factions, and castes. The symbols may appear on flags, shields,
helmets, badges, embroidery, standards, clothing, coins, and more.
The symbols used may include geometric patterns, calligraphed lines
of script, fantastic beasts, religious symbols, and magical seals
(made for the express purpose of identification). Heraldry can vary
from the highly formalized rules and regulations of late medieval
Europe to the knowledge of different shield patterns and shapes used
by African tribesmen.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The character automatically
knows the different heraldic symbols of his homeland and whom they
are associated with. In addition, if the character makes a successful
proficiency check, he can correctly identify the signs and symbols of
other lands, provided he has at least a passing knowledge of the
inhabitants of that land. His heraldry skill is of little use upon
first entering a foreign land.</font></p>

herbalist knowledge can identify plants and fungus and prepare
nonmagical potions, poultices, powders, balms, salves, ointments,
infusions, and plasters for medical and pseudo-medical purposes. They
can also prepare natural plant poisons and purgatives. The DM must
decide the exact strength of such poisons based on the poison rules
in the DMG. A character with both herbalism and healing proficiencies
gains bonuses when using his healing talent (see the Healing

wilderness settings, the character can attempt to stalk and bring
down game. A proficiency check must be made with a -1 penalty to the
ability score for every nonproficient hunter in the party. If the die
roll is successful, the hunter (and those with him) have come within
101 to 200 yards (100+1d100) of an animal. The group can attempt to
close the range, but a proficiency check must be made for each 20
yards closed. If the stalking is successful, the hunter automatically
surprises the game. The type of animal stalked depends on the nature
of the terrain and the whim of the DM.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The character
can juggle, a talent useful for entertainments, diversions, and
certain rare emergencies. When juggling normally (to entertain or
distract), no proficiency check is required. A check is made when
trying spectacular tricks (&quot;Watch me eat this apple in
mid-air!&quot;). However, juggling also enables the character to
attempt desperate moves. On a successful attack roll vs. AC 0 (not a
proficiency check), the character can catch small items thrown to
harm him (as opposed to items thrown for him to catch). Thus, the
character could catch a dagger or a dart before it hits. If this
attack roll fails, however, the character automatically suffers
damage (sticking your hand in the path of a dagger is likely to
hurt).</font></p>

can attempt exceptional leaps both vertically and horizontally. If
the character has at least a 20-foot running start, he can leap
(broad jump) 2d6+his level in feet. No character can broad jump more
than six times his height, however. With the same start, he can leap
vertically (high jump) 1d3 plus half his level in feet. No character
can high jump more than 1-½ times his own height.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

level in feet and high jump only three feet.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The character can also
attempt vaults using a pole. A vault requires at least a 30-foot
running start. If a pole is used, it must be four to 10 feet longer
than the character's height. The vault spans a distance equal to 1-½
times the length of the pole. The character can clear heights equal
to the height of the pole. He can also choose to land on his feet if
the vault carries him over an obstacle no higher than ½ the height
of his pole. Thus, using a 12-foot pole, the character could either
vault through a window 12 feet off the ground (tumbling into the room
beyond), land on his feet in an opening six feet off the ground, or
vault across a moat 18 feet wide. In all cases, the pole is dropped
at the end of the vault.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A character with
mining proficiency is needed to site and supervise the operations of
any mine. First, the character can attempt to determine what types of
ores or gems can be found in a given area. To do this, he must spend
at least a week searching a four-square-mile area. The DM may rule
that more area must be searched to find anything of value and may
thus increase the amount of time required. At the end of the search,
the character can say what is likely to be found in this area. After
this, the character can site the mine. On a successful proficiency
check (made secretly by the DM), the character has found a good site
to begin mining for any minerals that may be in the area. The check
does not guarantee a successful mine, only that a particular site is
the best choice in a given area. The DM must determine what minerals,
if any, are to be found in the region of the mine. On a failed check,
the character only thinks he has found a good site. Much effort is
spent before the character is proved wrong, of course.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once the mine is in
operation, a character with mining proficiency must remain on site to
supervise all work. Although this is a steady job, most player
characters will find it better to hire an NPC for this purpose.</font></p>

slopes and cliffs with the aid of spikes, ropes, etc. If a character
with mountaineering proficiency leads a party, placing the pitons
(spikes) and guiding the others, all in the party can gain the
benefit of his knowledge. A mountaineer can guide a party up a cliff
face it could not otherwise climb. A character with this proficiency
gains a 10% bonus per proficiency slot spent to his chance to climb
any surface. Note that mountaineering is not the same as the thief's

information (type of religious symbol used, basic attitude of the
faith, etc.) of any religion is automatically known by the character.

significance of particular holy days, requires a proficiency check.</font></p>

Airborne:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The character is
trained in handling a flying mount. The particular creature must be
chosen when the proficiency is chosen. Additional proficiency slots
can be used to learn how to handle other types of mounts. Unlike
land-based riding, a character must have this proficiency (or ride
with someone who does) to handle a flying mount. In addition, a
proficient character can do the following:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• Leap onto the saddle of
the creature (when it is standing on the ground) and spur it airborne
as a single action. This requires no proficiency check.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• Leap from the back of
the mount and drop 10 feet to the ground or onto the back of another
mount (land-based or flying). Those with only light encumbrance can
drop to the ground without a proficiency check. In all other
situations, a proficiency check is required. A failed roll means the
character takes normal falling damage (for falling flat on his face)
or misses his target (perhaps taking large amounts of damage as a
result). A character who is dropping to the ground can attempt an
immediate melee attack, if his proficiency check is made with a -4
penalty to the ability roll. Failure has the consequences given
above.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• Spur his mount to
greater speeds on a successful check, adding 1d4 to the movement rate
of the mount. This speed can be maintained for four consecutive
rounds. If the check fails, an attempt can be made again the next
round. If two checks fail, no attempt can be made for a full turn.
After the rounds of increased speed, its movement drops to 2/3 its
normal rate and its Maneuverability Class (see Glossary) becomes one
class worse. These conditions last until the mount lands and is
allowed to rest for at least one hour.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
    • <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The rider can
guide the mount with his knees and feet, keeping his hands free. A
proficiency check is made only after the character suffers damage. If
the check is failed, the character is knocked from the saddle. A
second check is allowed to see if the character manages to catch
himself (thus hanging from the side by one hand or in some equally
perilous position). If this fails, the rider falls. Of course a rider
can strap himself into the saddle, although this could be a
disadvantage if his mount is slain and plummets toward the ground.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Those skilled in
land riding are proficient in the art of riding and handling horses
or other types of ground mounts. When the proficiency slot is filled,
the character must declare which type of mount he is proficient in.
Possibilities include griffons, unicorns, dire wolves, and virtually
any creatures used as mounts by humans, demihumans, or humanoids.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A character with riding
proficiency can perform all of the following feats. Some of them are
automatic, while others require a proficiency check for success.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• The character can vault
onto a saddle whenever the horse or other mount is standing still,
even when the character is wearing armor. This does not require a
proficiency check. The character must make a check, however, if he
wishes to get the mount moving during the same round in which he
lands in its saddle. He must also make a proficiency check if he
attempts to vault onto the saddle of a moving mount. Failure
indicates that the character falls to the ground--presumably quite
embarrassed.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• The character can urge
the mount to jump tall obstacles or leap across gaps. No check is
required if the obstacle is less than three feet tall or the gap is
less than 12 feet wide. If the character wants to roll a proficiency
check, the mount can be urged to leap obstacles up to seven feet
high, or jump across gaps up to 30 feet wide. Success means that the
mount has made the jump. Failure indicates that it balks, and the
character must make another proficiency check to see whether he
retains his seat or falls to the ground.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• The character can spur
his steed on to great speeds, adding 6 feet per round to the animal's
movement rate for up to four turns. This requires a proficiency check
each turn to see if the mount can be pushed this hard. If the initial
check fails, no further attempts may be made, but the mount can move
normally. If the second or subsequent check fails, the mount
immediately slows to a walk, and the character must dismount and lead
the animal for a turn. In any event, after four turns of racing, the
steed must be walked by its dismounted rider for one turn.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• The character can guide
his mount with his knees, enabling him to use weapons that require
two hands (such as bows and two-handed swords) while mounted. This
feat does not require a proficiency check unless the character takes
damage while so riding. In this case, a check is required and failure
means that the character falls to the ground and sustains an
additional 1d6 points of damage.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• The character can drop
down and hang alongside the steed, using it as a shield against
attack. The character cannot make an attack or wear armor while
performing this feat. The character's Armor Class is lowered by 6
while this maneuver is performed. Any attacks that would have struck
the character's normal Armor Class are considered to have struck the
mount instead. No proficiency check is required.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• The character can leap
from the back of his steed to the ground and make a melee attack
against any character or creature within 10 feet. The player must
roll a successful proficiency check with a -4 penalty to succeed. On
a failed roll, the character fails to land on his feet, falls
clumsily to the ground, and suffers 1d3 points of damage.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This proficiency
enables a character to accomplish amazing feats with rope. A
character with rope use proficiency is familiar with all sorts of
knots and can tie knots that slip, hold tightly, slide slowly, or
loosen with a quick tug. If the character's hands are bound and held
with a knot, he can roll a proficiency check (with a -6 penalty) to
escape the bonds.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This character gains a +2
bonus to all attacks made with a lasso. The character also receives a
+10% bonus to all climbing checks made while he is using a rope,
including attempts to belay (secure the end of a climbing rope)
companions.</font></p>

the day he must sleep for eight hours. After the first day's
movement, the character must roll a proficiency check for success. If
the die roll succeeds, the character can continue his running
movement the next day. If the die roll fails, the character cannot
use his running ability the next day. If involved in a battle during
a day he spent running, he suffers a -1 penalty to his attack rolls.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The character
can make simple snares and traps, primarily to catch small game.
These can include rope snares and spring traps. A proficiency check
must be rolled when the snare is first constructed and every time the
snare is set. A failed proficiency check means the trap does not work
for some reason. It may be that the workmanship was bad, the
character left too much scent in the area, or he poorly concealed the
finished work. The exact nature of the problem does not need to be
known. The character can also attempt to set traps and snares for
larger creatures: tiger pits and net snares, for example. A
proficiency check must be rolled, this time with a -4 penalty to the
ability score. In both cases, setting a successful snare does not
ensure that it catches anything, only that the snare works if
triggered. The DM must decide if the trap is triggered.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thief characters (and only
thieves) with this proficiency can also attempt to rig man-traps.
These can involve such things as crossbows, deadfalls, spiked
springboards, etc. The procedure is the same as that for setting a
large snare. The DM must determine the amount of damage caused by a
man-trap.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Setting a small snare or trap
takes one hour of work. Setting a larger trap requires two to three
people (only one need have the proficiency) and 2d4 hours of work.
Setting a man-trap requires one or more people (depending on its
nature) and 1d8 hours of work. To prepare any trap, the character
must have appropriate materials on hand.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Characters with animal lore
proficiency gain a +2 bonus to their ability score when attempting to
set a snare for the purposes of catching game. Their knowledge of
animals and the woods serves them well for this purpose. They gain no
benefit when attempting to trap monsters or intelligent beings.</font></p>

an accomplished singer and can use this ability to entertain others
and perhaps earn a small living (note that bards can do this
automatically). No proficiency check is required to sing. The

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Although this
proficiency does not grant the character any spellcasting powers, it
does give him familiarity with the different forms and rites of
spellcasting. If he observes and overhears someone who is casting a
spell, or if he examines the material components used, he can attempt
to identify the spell being cast. A proficiency check must be rolled
to make a correct identification. Wizard specialists gain a +3 bonus
to the check when attempting to identify magic of their own school.
Note that since the spellcaster must be observed until the very
instant of casting, the spellcraft proficiency does not grant an
advantage against combat spells. The proficiency is quite useful,
however, for identifying spells that would otherwise have no visible
effect.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Those talented in this

able to build structures from stone so that they last many years. He
can do simple stone carvings, such as lettering, columns, and
flourishes. The stone can be mortared, carefully fitted without
mortar, or loosely fitted and chinked with rocks and earth. A
stonemason equipped with his tools (hammers, chisels, wedges, block
and tackle) can build a plain section of wall one foot thick, ten
feet long, and five feet high in one day, provided the stone has
already been cut. A stonemason can also supervise the work of
unskilled laborers to quarry stone; one stonemason is needed for

must be applied to a specific environment--i.e., a specific type of
terrain and weather factors. Typical environments include arctic,
woodland, desert, steppe, mountain, or tropical. The character has
basic survival knowledge for that terrain type. Additional
proficiency slots can be used to add more types of terrain.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A character skilled in
survival has a basic knowledge of the hazards he might face in that
land. He understands the effects of the weather and knows the proper
steps to lessen the risk of exposure. He knows the methods to locate
or gather drinkable water. He knows how to find basic, not
necessarily appetizing, food where none is apparent, thus staving off
starvation. Furthermore, a character with survival skill can instruct
and aid others in the same situation. When using the proficiency to
find food or water, the character must roll a proficiency check. If
the check is failed, no more attempts can be made that day.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The survival skill in no way
releases the player characters from the hardships and horrors of
being lost in the wilderness. At best it alleviates a small portion
of the suffering. The food found is barely adequate, and water is
discovered in minuscule amounts. It is still quite possible for a
character with survival knowledge to die in    the wilderness.
Indeed, the little knowledge the character has may lead to
overconfidence and doom!</font></p>

can attempt to walk narrow ropes or beams with greater than normal
chances of success. He can negotiate any narrow surface not angled up
or down greater than 45 degrees. Each round the character can walk 60
feet. One proficiency check is made every 60 feet (or part thereof),
with failure indicating a fall. The check is made with a -10 penalty
to the ability score if the surface is one inch or less in width (a
rope), a -5 penalty if two inches to six inches wide, and unmodified
if seven inches to 12 inches wide. Wider than one foot requires no
check for proficient characters under normal circumstances. Every
additional proficiency spent on tightrope walking reduces these
penalties by 1. Use of a balancing rod reduces the penalties by 2.
Winds or vibrations in the line increases the penalties by 2 to 6.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

fight while on a tightrope, but he suffers a -5 penalty to his attack
roll and must roll a successful proficiency check at the beginning of

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The modifiers in Table 39 are
cumulative--total the modifiers for all conditions that apply and
combine that with the tracker's Wisdom score to get the modified
chance to track.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, if Thule's
Wisdom score is 16 and he is trying to track through mud (+4), at
night (-6), during a sleet storm (-5), his chance to track is 9
(16+4-6-5). (Thule is a ranger so he does not suffer the -6 penalty
for non-rangers tracking.)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For tracking to succeed, the
creature tracked must leave some type of trail. Thus, it is virtually
impossible to track flying or noncorporeal creatures. The DM may
allow this in rare instances, but he should also assign substantial
penalties to the attempt.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To track a creature, the
character must first find the trail. Indoors, the tracker must have
seen the creature in the last 30 minutes and must begin tracking from
the place last seen. Outdoors, the tracker must either have seen the
creature, have eyewitness reports of its recent movement (&quot;Yup,
we saw them orcs just high-tail it up that trail there not but
yesterday.&quot;), or must have obvious evidence that the creature is
in the area (such as a well-used game trail). If these conditions are
met, a proficiency check is rolled. Success means a trail has been
found. Failure means no trail has been found. Another attempt cannot
be made until the above conditions are met again under different
circumstances.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once the trail is found,
additional proficiency checks are rolled for the following
situations:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• The chance to track
decreases (terrain, rain, creatures leaving the group, darkness,
etc.).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• A second track crosses
the first.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• The party resumes
tracking after a halt (to rest, eat, fight, etc.).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once the tracker fails a
proficiency check, another check can be rolled after spending at
least one hour searching the area for new signs. If this check is
failed, no further attempts can be made. If several trackers are
following a trail, a +1 bonus is added to the ability score of the
most adept tracker. Once he loses the trail, it is lost to all.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the modifiers lower the
chance to track below 0 (for example, the modifiers are -11 and the
character's Wisdom is 10), the trail is totally lost to that
character and further tracking is impossible (even if the chance
later improves). Other characters may be able to continue tracking,
but that character cannot.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A tracking character can also
attempt to identify the type of creatures being followed and the
approximate number by rolling a proficiency check. All the normal
tracking modifiers apply. One identifying check can be rolled each
time a check is rolled to follow the trail. A successful check
identifies the creatures (provided the character has some knowledge
of that type of creature) and gives a rough estimate of their
numbers. Just how accurate this estimate is depends on the DM.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When following a trail, the
character (and those with him) must slow down, the speed depending on
the character's modified chance to track as found from Table 39.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Although your character has
some impressive abilities and skills, he really isn't going to be
effective without the equipment necessary for adventuring. To get
this equipment, he needs money. Not only does he need money to outfit
himself, but your character also has to cover his living expenses.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although there are many
different types of coins and currencies in the world, all prices and
treasures in the AD&amp;D rules are given in standard coinage. Your
DM may have specific names for different coins and may have different
rates of exchange, but this is material particular to his campaign.
He will tell you if there are differences from the coins listed here.
The standard rate of exchange for each coin is given in Table 42.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The basic coins are the
copper piece (cp) and the silver piece (sp). These form the backbone
of the monetary system and are the coins most frequently found in the
hands of the common folk. Above these two coins is the much rarer
gold piece (gp). This coin is seldom found in common use and mainly
exists on paper as the standard money of account. This means it is
used to measure the value of property and goods. Land values, ship
cargoes, gemstones, and penalty bonds (royal court fines) are
normally calculated in gold pieces, although payment of such vast
sums normally takes other forms.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition to these coins,
there are other unusual metals used in exchange. Most of these come
from failed currencies. As such, they are viewed with skepticism by
many honest folk. Principal among these coins are the electrum (ep)
and platinum pieces (pp). These coins are rarely circulated, and most
are hidden away in ancient treasure hoards.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, remember that not
all wealth is measured by coins. Wealth can take many forms--land,
livestock, the right to collect taxes or customs, and jewelry are all
measures of wealth. Coins have no guaranteed value. A gold piece can
buy a lot in a small village but won't go very far in a large city.
This makes other forms of wealth, land for instance, all the more
valuable. Indeed, many a piece of jewelry is actually a way of
carrying one's wealth. Silver armbands can be traded for goods, a
golden brooch can buy a cow, etc. In your adventures, wealth and
riches may take many different forms.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, in your DM's
campaign, there may be special situations or considerations to bear
in mind. The Kingdom of Gonfli may be at war with the neighboring
Principality of Boosk. Patriotic Gonflians might refuse Boosk coins
(probably because they think the coins are worthless). Practical
Booskites might accept the Gonfli florin at half normal value (so
they can melt them down and mint new Boosk drachmas). Of course, both
groups would send your character to the local money changer (if there
is one), who would cheerfully convert your foreign coins to the local
tender. He will, of course, charge a small commission (10-30%) for
this service.</font></p>

</b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A war horse,
or any animal trained for combat, is a considerable investment for
the average warrior. Therefore, it behooves the owner to see that his
mount is as well protected as possible. Other than avoiding risks,
the best nonmagical protection is horse armor or barding. Barding is
simply some type of armor fitted to be worn by the mount. Full
barding covers the neck, chest, and body of the beast, while half
barding covers the head, neck, chest, and front quarters. Barding can
be made from many different materials; stouter types provide
increasing protection according to the Armor Class of the
construction. All of this, however, is at the expense of increased
weight and lowered maneuverability of the mount. Plate barding, for
example, is the equivalent of a warrior's field plate and is made of
carefully interlocked plates and joints. It provides an Armor Class
of 2 to the mount. It weighs at least 80 to 100 pounds at the
lightest and thus, a fully equipped war horse with this armor can
manage little more than a steady trot at top speed.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Barded animals also require
special attention. Care must be taken to prevent chafing and sores.
The mount cannot wear the armor indefinitely. It must be removed at
night and ideally should not be worn except in preparation for a
battle or tournament. Removing horse barding takes 15 minutes for
leather and 30 minutes for metal armors. Fitting it on takes twice as
long. The weight of barding is carefully distributed to account for
the weight of the armor and the rider, so barded animals cannot be
used as pack animals! It is normal practice to have a second mount
for carrying gear and supplies.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When barding is fitted over a
mount whose natural Armor Class is better than the barding, some
protection is still gained. This is explained under &quot;Armor&quot;
later in this chapter.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition to horses and
elephants, it may be possible to fit barding on more fantastic
mounts. Flying steeds can wear only leather or magical barding.
Aquatic creatures cannot wear normal barding although extremely rare
magical pieces may exist. Other land creatures can certainly be
barded, provided your DM rules that they are sturdy enough to carry
the weight of armor and rider. Camels, for instance, are seldom
barded for this reason. A huge ostrich would not be able to carry
barding, since its legs would not support the weight.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">There are two
basic saddles--riding and pack. Riding saddles take many forms, but
their basic purpose is to carry a person. If your DM has set his
campaign in an ancient or early Medieval setting, saddles may be
without stirrups. Ask your DM to be sure. Pack saddles are special
frames designed to carry supplies and equipment. The only practical
limit to how much a well-stowed pack saddle can carry is the carrying
ability of the animal.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This ship was
sailed in late Medieval/early Renaissance times and was the type of
ship Columbus used to reach the New World. (It should be used only in
late Medieval settings.) It normally has two or three masts and
square sails. No oars are used. The typical caravel is 70 feet long
and 20 feet wide. The normal crew is from 30 to 40 men. The average
cargo displacement is 150-200 tons.</font></p>

round ship, this is a small merchant ship that hugs the coasts. This
is a sailing ship, fitted with two masts and triangular sails. The
average size is 60 to 70 feet long and 20 feet wide. The rudder hangs
from one side. The crew is 20 to 30 men, and the cargo capacity is
about 100 tons. Normally there is only a small sterncastle. A coaster
is slow and not tremendously seaworthy, but it can carry large
amounts of cargo with smaller crews than galleys.</font></p>

a larger, improved version of the coaster, able to make ventures into
the open sea. Like the coaster, it is a sailing ship with one or two
masts, but the cog employs square sails. It is about 75 to 90 feet
long and 20 feet wide. The crew is only 18 to 20 men. There is
normally one deck and fore- and sterncastle. the cargo capacities of
cogs vary greatly, but the average is 100 to 200 tons.	</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This is an
early, primitive vessel. It is made from thick hides stretched over a
wood-and-wicker frame. A single mast caries a small square sail, but
the currach is usually worked by oars. It is normally 20 to 40 feet
long. the crew is approximately six to eight and the cargo space is
limited--no more than five tons.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The largest of
the Viking longships is known as a drakkar or dragonship. Built for
war, this ship stretches about 100 feet in length. Although a single
mast can be raised, oars provide the main source of power. The crew
of 60 to 80 men rows, one man to an oar. Up to 160 additional man can
be carried for boarding and raiding. Due to its great size, a drakkar
is not very seaworthy. This and the fact there is no space on board
for many supplies (certainly not enough for 240 men) or sleeping
quarters keep the drakkar close to the coast where it can put in for
the night. Because of its cost and limited use, a drakkar is usually
built by kings and rulers and is not used for the mundane task of
shipping cargo. </font>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This ship is the
largest of the Byzantine galleys. Although it boasts one or two masts
and triangular sails, the main power comes from the 100 oars, 50 to a
side. These oars are divided into an upper and lower bank, with one
man per oar on the lower bank and three men on the upper bank. Thus,
the total crew is about 200 men. The dromond is about 130 to 175 feet
long and 15 feet wide, making it a very slender ship. The cargo
capacity is around 70 to 100 tons.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A dromond can be used both
for shipping and war. As a warship, a ram projects from the front
just above the water line. Castles are built fore, aft, and amidships
as firing platforms. The cargo space is then taken up by marines.
With such numbers of men, it is a very dangerous ship to attack. A
dromond is not a seaworthy craft, however, and usually sails in sight
of shore. They beach at night like all galleys, since supplies and
sleeping accommodations are very limited.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This is the
largest and most advanced sailing ship that might be available in the
AD&amp;D game. It should appear only in Renaissance-period settings.
It is a sail-driven ship with three or four masts. There are normally
three through decks (running the length of the ship), while the
castles fore and aft have two decks. The average size is about 130
feet long and 30 feet wide. Crews average about 130 men. Although
cargo capacity is about 500 tons, a galleon is mainly used as a
warship. (In the real world they were fitted with cannon, something
beyond the standard AD&amp;D game rules.) They can easily carry men
equal to their tonnage, making capture by pirates nearly impossible.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Built during the
Late Middle Ages, the great galley is an improved version of the
dromond. It is slightly smaller than the dromond, about 130 feet long
and 20 feet wide. The main power comes from 140 rowers, one man to an
oar, but is supplemented by three masts; this combination gives it
better speed and handling. The cargo capacity is 150 tons. When
outfitted as a warship, the front end is built as a ram and marines
are carried instead of cargo. Like all galleys, the great galley is a
coastal vessel, rarely venturing into open water. It is not seaworthy
in heavy storms and waits in port for these to pass.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This small ship
was a common cargo ship of the Scandinavian region. It is 50 to 75
feet long and 15 to 20 feet wide. It has a single mast and a square
sail. In times of poor wind, a few oars at the bow and stern can
provide more power. The crew ranges from eight to 14 men. The cargo
capacity is small, anywhere from ten to 50 tons. The ship is,
however, relatively seaworthy and can be used to make long sea
voyages (although it cannot be called comfortable). Its flat bottom
makes it useful for sailing up rivers and estuaries, and it can be
beached easily.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This is the
standard Viking warship. It is more substantial than the knarr but
not nearly as massive as the drakkar. An average longship is 75 feet
long with 20 to 25 oars per side. Each oar is worked by a single man
for a total crew of 40 to 50 men. There is also a single mast and a
square sail. In addition to the crew, the ship can carry 120 to 150

small representations of all those things revered by
religions--stars, crosses, hammers, rosaries, anointed oils, blessed
wine, sacred teachings, and more. Just what constitutes a holy item
depends on the campaign your character is in. All good holy items
have similar effects on undead and other evil creatures, provided
they are wielded by a follower of a belief associated with these
items. Thus, rules that refer to holy symbols and holy water apply to
all similar items, provided these items are specially prepared by the
cleric's order.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Because of their special
nature, holy items cannot normally be purchased. Different sects tend
to protect the symbols of their faith to prevent their misuse or
corruption. Therefore such items must be obtained through the
auspices of a local congregation. This is not difficult for sincere
followers of that faith, although requests for rare or unusual items
must always be justified. Nonbelievers are given holy items only if
there is a clear and present danger to the faith.</font></p>

are no more noble than anyone else and may use sets of false
weights--one set heavier than normal for selling an item (causing the
customer to pay more) and another set lighter than usual for buying
items (letting the merchant pay less). In well-regulated areas,
officials verify the accuracy of weights and measures, but this in

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This weapon may
be disallowed by your DM and you must check with him before you
purchase it. An arquebus is an early form of the musket, almost as
dangerous to its user as it is to the target. To use an arquebus, you
must have a supply of powder and shot and a piece of slow-burning
match or cord. These items may or may not be commonly available.
(Powder is treated as a magical item in these rules.) The weapon can
be fired only once every three rounds, and then only if the character
is not attacked while loading. When firing an arquebus, all penalties
for range are doubled.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the attack roll for the
arquebus is a 1 or 2, the weapon backfires, causing 1d6 points of
damage to the firer. It is also fouled and cannot be used again until
it has been cleaned, which takes about 30 minutes. When a arquebus
scores a hit, it normally does 1 to 9 points of damage on 1d10. When
a 10 is rolled, the die is rolled again and this amount is added to
10. Each time a 10 is rolled, the die is rolled again and added to
the previous total. Thus, in a rare instance, a single shot could
inflict 37 points, for example, if three consecutive 10s were rolled,
followed by a 7. The damage caused by an arquebus is never modified
for a high Strength score.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Bows come in
various shapes and sizes. The power of a bow is measured by its pull.
The greater the pull, the more Strength needed to work the bow. Thus,
it is possible for characters to have bows that grant them damage
bonuses for high Strength (it is assumed the character has chosen a
bow that has a greater pull). Likewise, characters with low Strengths
suffer their usual penalties when using a bow (they are forced to use
weaker bows or simply cannot draw back as far). The pull of a bow
seldom prevents a character from using the weapon, only from gaining
the full effect. The true test of a character's Strength comes in
stringing a bow--the bow of a strong hero may simply be unstringable
by a lesser man (as was Odysseus's).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Heavier pull bows are not
normally any more expensive than standard bows. The exceptions to
this are those bows that enable the fighter to gain bonuses for
exceptional Strength (18/01 or greater). These bows must be custom
crafted and cost three to five times the normal price. These bows are
also difficult to string or use effectively for those without
exceptional Strength. These characters must roll a successful bend
bars/lift gates roll to string or use such weapons (again, think of
the test of the suitors in Odysseus's household).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Arrows for long bows of all
types are divided between lightweight flight arrows and heavier sheaf
arrows. Flight arrows have longer ranges and are normally used in
hunting. Sheaf arrows have a stronger metal head but a reduced range.
They are often used in times of war.</font></p>

or penalties do not apply to crossbows, since these are purely
mechanical devices. The hand crossbow is easily held in one hand and
cocked with the other. The light crossbow, also called latches, must
be braced against an object to be cocked with a lever mounted on the
stock. The heavy crossbow, also called arbalest, has a powerful pull
and must be cocked with a cranequin (a simple winch or lever) that
comes with the weapon. One foot is places in a stirrup at the end of
the crossbow while the cranequin is worked. All crossbows fire
quarrels or bolts and the correct size must be used with each weapon.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The different
lances are rated according to size and sturdiness. Each type can be
used only if the rider is on the same type of horse or a greater one.
A man on a light war horse could not use a heavy horse lance, if only
because the impact would bowl him and the horse right over!
Furthermore, the heavy and jousting lances require that the rider is
firmly in a saddle and using stirrups. The jousting lance is a heavy
horse lance modified for use in tournaments, in which the desire is
not to kill the opponent. The end of the lance is fitted with a
special blunted tip intended to lessen the chance of wounds. Of
course, good intentions often go awry, so there is still a chance of
injury during a joust.</font></p>

highly specialized type of polearm designed to capture without
killing a victim. It consists of a long pole with a spring-loaded set
of sharpened jaws at the end. The victim is caught between the arms,
which then snap shut. The mancatcher is effective only on man-sized
creatures. The target is always treated as AC 10, modified for
Dexterity. If a hit is scored, the character is caught. The caught
victim loses all shield and Dexterity bonuses and can be pushed and
pulled about. This causes an automatic 1d2 points of damage per round
and gives a 25% chance of pulling the victim to the ground. The
victim can escape on a successful bend bars/lift gates roll, although
this results in 1d2 points more damage. A common tactic is to use the
weapon to pull horsemen off their mounts, then pin them to the
ground.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A popular group
of weapons during the ancient and Medieval periods were the polearms.
Their length was a distinct advantage and, for the peasant, they were
a relatively easy weapon to make. Thus, there came to be an abundance
of polearms of different sizes and shapes. Due to their numbers,
there is no standard system for naming polearms. The names used in
the AD&amp;D game might possibly be applied to other weapons
elsewhere.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Because of their length, all
polearms are infantry weapons and require two hands to use. They are
almost always the weapon of the common peasant and soldier, who,
lacking a horse and heavy armor, needs some weapon to keep the
enemy's knights at bay. Thus, most polearms are intended to be used
in close-packed formations that present a forest of sharp points and
wicked blades to any knight foolish enough to charge.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Essentially this
is a long spear 12 to 20 feet long ending in a spike point of tapered
spear head. It was a popular weapon during the Renaissance. Since the
pike stuck out in front, men could be packed side-by-side in dense
formations, and several rows of men could fight. Large blocks of
pikemen made formidable troops. However, once the pikemen engaged in
close combat, they normally dropped their clumsy awl pikes and fought
hand-to-hand with short swords.</font></p>

large curving axe-head is mounted on the end of a shaft 5 to 8 feet
long. It probably grew out of common peasant tools and was popular
with them. One relative disadvantage is that the bardiche required
more space to wield than a pike or a spear.</font></p>

punch through plate, while the hammer side can be used to give a
stiff blow. The end is fitted with a short blade for dealing with
unarmored or helpless foes. The weapon is about eight feet long.

an outgrowth of the common bill hook. Mounted on a seven- to
eight-foot-long pole, it has a combination of a heavy cleaver blade,
a jutting back spike, and a hook or spike on the end. Thus, it can be

pike and the bill, this was one of the most popular weapons of the
Middle Ages. Fixed on a shaft five to eight feet long is a large axe
blade, angled for maximum impact. The end of the blade tapers to a
long spear point or awl pike. On the back is a hook for attacking
armor or dismounting riders. Originally intended to defeat cavalry,
it is not tremendously successful in that role since it lacks the
reach of the pike and needs considerable room to swing. It found new
life against blocks of pikemen. Should the advance of the main attack
stall, halberdiers issue out of the formation and attack the flanks
of the enemy. The pikemen with their overlong weapons are nearly
defenseless in such close combat.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The equipment list reflects
the price of a suit of armor (including an appropriate helmet) made
for any normal player character race. Although a halfling is much
smaller than a human and needs a smaller suit, there are fewer
armorers available to meet such specialized needs. Thus, the armor
for a halfling is as expensive as that for a human. Armor for
nonstandard sizes and shapes is going to cost significantly more and
must be custom-made. This is not the kind of thing one can pick up at
the local store!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When armor is found during
the course of an adventure, the players should note the creature who
wore the armor previously. While a human-sized character might be
able to wear the armor of a gnoll, it will do little good for a
halfling. Likewise, the armor of a giant is of little use to anyone.</font></p>

Into and Out of Armor</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are times when it is
important to know how quickly a character can get into or out of his
armor. Accidents and unforeseen events happen all the time. The party
is attacked at night. Those sleeping around the campfire may want to
don their armor before rushing into battle. A character slips and
falls into the river where his heavy armor pulls him down like a
stone. He greatly desires to get it off before he drowns. Just how
long does it take him?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The time required to don
armor depends on its make. Those armors that are a single
piece--leather tunics, robes, chain mail--take one round (two for
metal items) to don with slight assistance. Without aid, the time is
doubled. Armor that is made of separate pieces require 1d6 + 4
rounds, again with assistance. Without help, the time required is
tripled. In all cases, the times given assume that the proper
undergarments and padding are also worn.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes characters need to
get into armor in a hurry and thus, they dress hastily. This assumes
that some buckles aren't fastened, seatings adjusted, etc. Single
suits can be hastily donned in one round at the cost of 1 worse AC
(though never worse than 8). Thus, a fighter could hastily pull on
his brigandine jack (AC 6) and charge into a fray with an AC of 7.
Hastily donning piece armor (plate mail for example) improves the
character's AC by 1 (from a base of 10) for every round spent
dressing. A fighter could choose to spend three rounds fitting on
parts of his plate mail, giving him an AC of 7, before going into
battle.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Removing armor is a much
quicker matter. Most can be shed in a single round. Piece armor
(particularly full plate) requires 1d4 + 1 rounds. However, if the
character is willing to cut straps and bend pins, such armors can be
removed in half the time (roll 1d4 + 1, divide by 2, then round
fractions up).</font></p>

of Encumbrance </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Encumbrance has two basic
effects. First, it reduces your character's movement rate. If
encumbrance categories are used, Unencumbered has no effect on
movement, Light reduces the movement rate by 1/3 (round fractions
down), Moderate reduces it by ½, Heavy reduces it by 2/3, and Severe
lowers the movement rate to 1. If the optional system is used, the
character's movement rate is reduced to the amount found by using
Table 48. The movement rate determines how far your character can
move in a round, turn, hour, and day. As his movement rate gets
lower, your character moves slower and slower. See &quot;Movement&quot;
in Chapter 14: Time and Movement for more details.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Encumbrance also reduces your
character's combat abilities. If encumbrance reduces your character
to ½ of his normal movement rate, he suffers a -1 penalty to his
attack roll. If he is reduced to 1/3 or less of his normal movement
rate, the attack penalty is -2 and there is an additional AC penalty
of +1. If your character's movement is reduced to 1, the attack roll
penalty is -4 and the AC penalty is +3. Clearly, the wise thing for a
heavily encumbered character to do is to quickly drop most of his
gear before entering battle.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The vast majority of people
in a fantasy campaign lack these traits or have never had the
opportunity to develop them. The baker may be a bright and clever
fellow, but, following in his father's footsteps, he has spent his
life learning the arts of bread making. There has simply been no time
in his life for the study of old books and crumbling scrolls. The
hard-working peasant may be pious and upright in his faith, but he
lacks the time for the contemplative and scholarly training required
of a priest. So it is only a fortunate few who have the ability and
opportunity to learn the arcane lore of spellcasting.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A few character classes have
a limited ability to cast spells. The ranger, through his close
association with nature, is able to cast a few spells, though his
choices are limited to his natural inclinations. The paladin, through
his devotion and humility, can use some of the spells of the priest.
The bard, through luck, happenstance, curiosity, and perseverance,
can manage a few wizard spells, perhaps by persuading a lonely wizard
to reveal his secrets.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Regardless of their source,
all spells fall into the general categories of wizard or priest.
Although some spells appear in both categories, in general the
categories differ in how spells are acquired, stored, and cast.</font></p>

<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Wizard
Spells </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Wizard spells range from
spells of simple utility to great and powerful magics. The wizard
spell group has no single theme or purpose. The vast majority of
wizard spells were created by ancient wizards for many different
purposes. Some are to serve the common man in his everyday needs.
Others provide adventurers with the might and firepower they need to
survive. Some are relatively simple and safe to use (as safe as magic
can be); others are complicated, filled with hazards and snares for
the rash and unwary. Perhaps the greatest of all wizard spells is the
powerful and tricky </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>wish.</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
It represents the epitome of spell-casting--causing things to happen
simply because the wizard desires it to be so. But it is a long and
difficult task to attain the mastery needed to learn this spell.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although some characters can
use spells, the workings of magic are dimly understood at best. There
are many theories about where the power comes from. The most commonly
accepted idea is that the mysterious combination of words, gestures,
and materials that make up a spell somehow taps an extradimensional
source of energy that in turn causes the desired effect. Somehow the
components of the spells--those words, gestures and materials--route
this energy to a specific and desired result. Fortunately, how this
happens is not very important to the majority of wizards. It is
enough to know that &quot;when you do this, that happens.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Casting a wizard spell is a
very complicated ordeal. The process of learning the correct
procedure to cast a spell is difficult and taxing to the mind. Thus,
a wizard must check to see if he learns each new spell (according to
his Intelligence--see Table 4). Furthermore, there is a limit to just
how much of this strangeness--illogical mathematics, alchemical
chemistry, structuralist linguistics--a wizard's mind can comprehend,
and so he must live with a limit to the number of spells he can know.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As the wizard learns spells,
he records their arcane notes into his spell books. Without spell
books, a wizard cannot memorize new spells. Within them are all his
instructions for memorizing and casting all the spells he knows. As
the wizard successfully learns a new spell, he carefully enters its
formula into his spell books. A wizard can never have a spell in his
books that he does not know, because if he doesn't understand it, he
cannot write the formula. Likewise, he cannot enter a spell into his
books that is higher in level than he can cast. If he finds an
ancient tome with spells of higher power, he must simply wait until
he advances to a level at which he can use them.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The exact shape and size of a
character's spellbooks is a detail your DM will provide. They may be
thick tomes of carefully inked parchment, crackling scrolls in bulky
cases, or even weighty clay tablets. They are almost never convenient
to carry around. Their exact form depends on the type and setting of
the campaign world your DM has created.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Ultimately, it is the
memorization that is important. To draw on magical energy, the wizard
must shape specific mental patterns in his mind. He uses his spell
books to force his mind through mental exercises, preparing it to
hold the final, twisted patterns. These patterns are very complicated
and alien to normal thought, so they don't register in the mind as
normal learning. To shape these patterns, the wizard must spend time
memorizing the spell, twisting his thoughts and recasting the energy
patterns each time to account for subtle changes--planetary motions,
seasons, time of day, and more.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once a wizard memorizes a
spell, it remains in his memory (as potential energy) until he uses
the prescribed components to trigger the release of the energy
patterns. The mental patterns apparently release the energy while the
components shape and guide it. Upon casting, the energy of the spell
is spent, wiped clean from the wizard's mind. The mental patterns are
lost until the wizard studies and memorizes that spell again.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The number of spells a wizard
can memorize is given by his level (see Table 21); he can memorize
the same spell more than once, but each memorization counts as one
spell toward his daily memorization limit. Part of a wizard's
intelligence can be seen in the careful selection of spells he has
memorized.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Memorization is not a thing
that happens immediately. The wizard must have a clear head gained
from a restful night's sleep and then has to spend time studying his
spell books. The amount of study time needed is 10 minutes per level
of the spell being memorized. Thus, a 9th-level spell (the most
powerful) would require 90 minutes of careful study. Clearly,
high-level spellcasters do not lightly change their memorized spells.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Spells remain memorized until
they are cast or wiped from the character's mind by a spell or
magical item. A wizard cannot choose to forget a memorized spell to
replace it with another one. He can, however, cast a spell just to
cleanse his mind for another spell. (The DM must make sure that the
wizard does not get experience for this.)</font></p>

of Magic </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although all wizard spells
are learned and memorized the same way, they fall into nine different
schools of magic. A school of magic is a group of related spells.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Abjuration</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spells are a group of specialized protective spells. Each is used to
prevent or banish some magical or nonmagical effect or creature. They
are often used to provide safety in times of great danger or when
attempting some other particularly dangerous spell.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Alteration</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spells cause a change in the properties of some already existing
thing, creature, or condition. This is accomplished by magical energy
channeled through the wizard.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Conjuration/summoning</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spells bring something to the caster from elsewhere. Conjuration
normally produces matter or items from some other place. Summoning
enables the caster to compel living creatures and powers to appear in
his presence or to channel extraplanar energies through himself.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Enchantment/charm</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spells cause a change in the quality of an item or the attitude of a
person or creature. Enchantments can bestow magical properties on
ordinary items, while charms can unduly influence the behavior of
beings.</font></p>

divinations</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> are
more powerful than lesser divinations (see below). These spells
enable the wizard to learn secrets long forgotten, to predict the
future, and to uncover things hidden or cloaked by spells.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Illusions</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
deal with spells to deceive the senses or minds of others. Spells
that cause people to see things that are not there, hear noises not
made, or remember things that never happened are all illusions.</font></p>

spells channel magical energy to create specific effects and
materials. Invocation normally relies on the intervention of some
higher agency (to whom the spell is addressed), while evocation
enables the caster to directly shape the energy.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Lesser
divination</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spells

school includes the most basic and vital spells of the wizard--those
he needs to practice other aspects of his craft. Lesser divinations

dead things or the restoration of life, limbs, or vitality to living

considered quite useful.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Learning
Spells </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Whether a character chooses
to be a mage or a specialist in one of the schools of magic, he must
learn his spells from somewhere. While it might be possible for the
exceptional wizard to learn the secrets of arcane lore entirely on
his own, it isn't very likely. It is far more likely that your
character was apprenticed to another wizard as a lad. This kindly
(severe), loving (callous), understanding (ill-tempered), generous
(mean-spirited), and upright (untrustworthy) master taught your
character everything he knows at the start of the game. Then, when it
was time, the master sent him into the world (threw him out) with a
smile and a pat on the back (snarling with his foot on your
character's behind).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Or perhaps your character
studied at a proper academy for wizards (if your DM has such things).
There he completed his lessons under the eye of a firm (mean) but
patient (irritable) tutor who was ready with praise for good work (a
cane for the slightest fault). But alas, your character's parents
were impoverished and his studies had to end (fed up with this
treatment, your youthful character fled during the night).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As you can see, there are a
number of ways your character might have learned his spells.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The one good thing that comes
from your character's studies is his initial spell book. It may have
been a gift from his school or he may have stolen it from his hated
master. Whatever the case, your character begins play with a spell
book containing up to a few 1st-level spells. Your DM will tell you
the exact number of spells and which spells they are. As your
character adventures, he will have the opportunity to add more spells
to his collection.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When your character attains a
new level, he may or may not receive new spells. This is up to your
DM. He may allow your character to return to his mentor (provided he
departed on good terms!) and add a few spells to his book. It may be
possible for your character to copy spells from the spell book of
another player character (with his permission, of course). Or he may
have to wait until he can find a spell book with new spells. How he
gets his spells is one of the things your DM decides.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In al cases, before he can
add a new spell to his spell book, you have to check to see if your
character learns that spell. The chance of learning a spell depends
on your wizard's Intelligence, as given in Table 4. This chance may
be raised or lowered if your character is a specialist.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Illusions
</font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of all spells, those of the
illusion school cause the most problems. Not that they are more
difficult for your player character to cast, but these spells are
more difficult for you to role-play and for your DM to adjudicate.
Illusions rely on the idea of believability, which in turn relies on
the situation and the state of mind of the victim. Your DM must
determine this for NPCs, which is perhaps an easier job. You must
role-play this for your character.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Spells of this school fall
into two basic groups. </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Illusions</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
are creations that manipulate light, color, shadow, sound, and
sometimes even scent. Higher level illusions tap energy from other
planes, and are actually quasi-real, being woven of extradimensional
energies by the caster. Common illusions create appearances; they
cannot make a creature or object look like nothing (i.e., invisible),
but they can conceal objects by making them look like something else.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Phantasms</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
exist only in the minds of their victims; these spells are never even
quasi-real. (The exceptions to this are the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>phantasmal
force</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spells, which
are actually illusions rather than phantasms.) Phantasms act upon the
mind of the victim to create an intense reaction--fear being most
common.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The key to successful
illusions or phantasms is believability, which depends on three main
factors: what the caster attempts, what the victim expects, and what
is happening at the moment the spell is cast. By combining the
information from these three areas, the player and the DM should be
able to create and adjudicate reasonable illusions and phantasms.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When casting an illusion or
phantasm, the caster can attempt to do anything he desires within the
physical limits of the spell. Prior knowledge of the illusion created
is not necessary but is extremely useful.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>	Suppose Delsenora decides
to cast a phantasmal force spell and can choose between creating the
image of a troll (a creature she has seen and battled) or that of a
beholder (a creature she has never seen but has heard terrifying
descriptions of). She can either use her memory to create a realistic
troll or use her imagination to create something that may or may not
look like a real beholder. The troll, based on her first-hand
knowledge of these creatures, is going to have lots of little
details--a big nose, warts, green, scabby skin, and even a shambling
troll-like walk. Her illusion of a beholder will be much less
precise, just a floating ball with one big eye and eyestalks. She
doesn't know its color, size, or behavior.</i></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The type of image chosen by
the caster affects the reaction of the victim. If the victim in the
above case has seen both a troll and a beholder, which will be more
believable? Almost certainly it will be the troll, which looks and
acts the way the victim thinks a troll should. He might not even
recognize the other creature as a beholder since it doesn't look like
any beholder he's ever seen. Even if the victim has never seen a
troll or a beholder, the troll will still be more believable; it acts
in a realistic manner, while the beholder does not. Thus,
spellcasters are well-advised to create images of things they have
seen, for the same reason authors are advised to write about things
they know.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The next important
consideration is to ask if the spell creates something that the
victim expects. Which of these two illusions would be more
believable--a huge dragon rising up behind a rank of attacking
kobolds (puny little creatures) or a few ogres forming a line behind
the kobolds? Most adventurers would find it hard to believe that a
dragon would be working with kobolds. The dragon is far too powerful
to associate with such little shrimps. Ogres, however, could very
well work with kobolds--bossing them around and using them as cannon
fodder. The key to a good illusion is to create something the victim
does not expect but can quickly accept.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The most believable illusion
may be that of a solid wall in a dungeon, transforming a passage into
a dead end. Unless the victim is familiar with these hallways, he has
no reason not to believe that the wall is there.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of course, in a fantasy world
many more things can be believed than in the real world. Flames do
not spring out of nowhere in the real world, but this can happen in a
fantasy world. The presence of magic in a fantasy world makes victims
more willing to accept things our logic tells us cannot happen. A
creature appearing out of nowhere could be an illusion or it could be
summoned. At the same time, you must remember that a properly
role-played character is familiar with the laws of his world. If a
wall of flames appears out of nowhere, he will look for the
spellcaster. A wall blocking a corridor may cause him to check for
secret doors. If the illusion doesn't conform to his idea of how
things work, the character should become suspicious. This is
something you have to provide for your character and something you
must remember when your character attempts to use illusions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This then leads to the third
factor in the believability of an illusion, how appropriate the
illusion is for the situation. As mentioned before, the victim is
going to have certain expectations about any given encounter. The
best illusions reinforce these expectations to your character's
advantage. Imagine that your group runs into a war party of orcs in
the local forest. What could you do that would reinforce what the
orcs might already believe? They see your group, armed and ready for
battle. They do not know if you are alone or are the advance guard
for a bigger troop. A good illusion could be the glint of metal and
spear points coming up behind your party. Subtlety has its uses. The
orcs will likely interpret your illusion as reinforcements to your
group, enough to discourage them from attacking.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, the limitations of
each spell must be considered when judging appropriateness. A
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>phantasmal force</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell creates vision only. It does not provide sound, light, or heat.
In the preceding situation, creating a troop of soldiers galloping up
behind you would not have been believable. Where is the thunder of
hooves, the creak of saddle leather, the shouts of your allies, the
clank of drawn metal, or the whinny of horses? Orcs may    not be
tremendously bright, but they are not fooled that easily. Likewise, a
dragon that suddenly appears without a thunderous roar and dragonish
stench isn't likely to be accepted as real. A wise spellcaster always
considers the limitations of his illusions and finds ways to hide
their weaknesses from the enemy.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	An illusion spell, therefore,
depends on its believability. Believability is determined by the
situation and a saving throw. Under normal circumstances, those
observing the illusion are allowed a saving throw vs. spell if they
actively disbelieve the illusion. For player characters, disbelieving
is an action in itself and takes a round. For NPCs and monsters, a
normal saving throw is made if the DM deems it appropriate. The DM
can give bonuses or penalties to this saving throw as he thinks
appropriate. If the caster has cleverly prepared a realistic
illusion, this certainly results in penalties on the victim's saving
throw. If the victim were to rely more on scent than sight, on the
other hand, it could gain bonuses to its saving throw. If the saving
throw is passed, the victim sees the illusion for what it is. If the
saving throw is failed, the victim believes the illusion. A good
indication of when player characters should receive a positive
modifier to their saving throws is when they say they don't believe
what they see, especially if they can give reasons why.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are rare instances when
the saving throw may automatically succeed or fail. There are times
when the illusion created is either so perfect or so utterly
fantastic as to be impossible even in a fantasy world. Be warned,
these occasions are very rare and you should not expect your
characters to benefit from them more than once or twice.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In many encounters, some
party members will believe an illusion while others see it for what
it really is. In these cases, revealing the truth to those deluded by
the spell is not a simple matter of telling them. The magic of the
spell has seized their minds. Considered from their point of view,
they se a horrible monster (or whatever) while a friend is telling
them it isn't real. They know magic can affect people's minds, but
whose mind has been affected in this case? At best, having an
illusion pointed out grants another saving throw with a +4 bonus.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Illusions do have other
limitations. The caster must maintain a show of reality at all times
when conducting an illusion. (If a squad of low-level fighters is
created, the caster dictates their hits, misses, damage inflicted,
apparent wounds, and so forth, and the referee decides whether the
bounds of believability have been exceeded.) Maintaining an illusion
normally requires concentration on the part of the caster, preventing
him from doing other things. Disturb him and the illusion vanishes.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Illusions are spells of
trickery and deceit, not damage and destruction. Thus, illusions
cannot be used to cause real damage. When a creature is caught in the
blast of an illusionary fireball or struck by the claws of an
illusionary troll, he thinks he takes damage. The DM should record
the illusionary damage (but tell the player his character has taken
real damage). If the character takes enough damage to &quot;die,&quot;
he collapses in a faint. A system shock roll should be made for the
character. (His mind, believing the damage to be real, may cause his
body to cease functioning!) If the character survives, he regains
consciousness after 1d3 turns with his illusionary damage healed. In
most cases, the character quickly realizes that it was all an
illusion.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When an illusion creates a
situation of inescapable death, such as a giant block dropping from
the ceiling, all those believing the illusion must roll for system
shock. If they fail, they die--killed by the sheer terror of the
situation. If they pass, they are allowed a new saving throw with a
+4 bonus. Those who pass recognize the illusion for what it is. Those
who fail faint for 1d3 turns.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Illusions do not enable
characters to defy normal physical laws. An illusionary bridge cannot
support a character who steps on it, even if he believes the bridge
is real. An illusionary wall does not actually cause a rock thrown at
it to bounce off. However, affected creatures attempt to simulate the
reality of what they see as much as possible. A character who falls
into an illusionary pit drops to the ground as if he had fallen. A
character may lean against an illusionary wall, not realizing that he
isn't actually putting his weight on it. If the same character were
suddenly pushed, he would find himself falling through the very wall
he thought was solid!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Illusions of creatures do not
automatically behave like those creatures, nor do they have those
creatures' powers. This depends on the caster's ability and the
victim's knowledge of the creatures. Illusionary creatures fight
using the caster's combat ability. They take damage and die when
their caster dictates it. An illusory orc could continue to fight,
showing no damage, even after it had been struck a hundred or a
thousand times. Of course, long before this its attackers will become
suspicious. Illusionary creatures can have whatever special abilities
the caster can make appear (i.e., a dragon's fiery breath or a
troll's regeneration), but they do not necessarily have unseen
special abilities. There is no way a caster can create the illusion
of a basilisk's gaze that turns people to stone. However, these
abilities might be manifested through the fears of the victims. For
example, Rath the fighter meets an illusionary basilisk. Rath has
fought these beasties before and knows what they can do. His gaze
accidentally locks with that of the basilisk. Primed by his own
fears, Rath must make a system shock roll to remain alive. But if
Rath had never seen a basilisk and had no idea that the creature's
gaze could turn him to stone, there is no way his mind could generate
the fear necessary to kill him. Sometimes ignorance is bliss!</font></p>

Spells </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The spells of a priest, while
sometimes having powers similar to those of the wizard, are quite
different in their overall tone. The priest's role, more often than
not, is as defender and guide for others. Thus, the majority of his
spells work to aid others or provide some service to the community in
which he lives. Few of his spells are truly offensive, but many can
be used cleverly to protect or defend.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Like the wizard, the priest's
level determines how many spells he retains. He must select these
spells in advance, demonstrating his wisdom and far-sightedness by
choosing those spells he thinks will be most useful in the trials
that lurk ahead.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Unlike the wizard, the priest
needs no spell book and does not roll to see if he learns spells.
Priest spells are obtained in an entirely different manner. To obtain
his spells, a priest must be faithful to the cause of his deity. If
the priest feels confident in this (and most do), he can pray for his
spells. Through prayer, the priest humbly and politely requests those
spells he wishes to memorize. Under normal circumstances, these
spells are then granted.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A priest's spell selection is
limited by his level and by the different spheres of spells. (The
spheres of influence, into which priest spells are divided, can be
found under &quot;Priests of a Specific Mythoi&quot; in Chapter 3:
player Character Classes.) Within the major spheres of his deity, a
priest can use any spell of a given level when he is able to cast
spells of that level. Thus, a druid is able to cast any 2nd-level
plant sphere spells when he is able to cast 2nd-level spells. For
spells belonging to the minor spheres of the priest's deity, he can
cast spells only up to 3rd level. The knowledge of what spells are
available to the priest becomes instantly clear as soon as he
advances in level. This, too, is bestowed by his deity.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Priests must pray to obtain
spells, as they are requesting their abilities from some greater
power, be it their deity or some intermediary agent of this power.
The conditions for praying are identical to those needed for the
wizard's studying. Clearly then, it behooves the priest to maintain
himself in good standing with this power, through word and deed.
Priests who slip in their duties, harbor indiscreet thoughts, or
neglect their beliefs, find that their deity has an immediate method
of redress. If the priest has failed in his duties, the deity can
deny him spells as a clear message of dissatisfaction. For minor
infractions, the deity can deny minor spells. Major failings result
in the denial of major spells or, even worse, all spells. These can
be regained if the character immediately begins to make amends for
his errors. Perhaps the character only needs to be a little more
vigilant, in the case of a minor fault. A serious transgression could
require special service, such as a quest or some great sacrifice of
goods. These are things your DM will decide, should your character
veer from the straight and narrow path of his religion.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, your DM may rule
that not all deities are equal, so that those of lesser power are
unable to grant certain spells. If this optional rule is used, powers
of demi-god status can only grant spells up to the 5th spell level.
Lesser deities can grant 6th-level spells, while the greater deities
have all spell levels available to them. You should inquire about
this at the time you create your character (and decide which deity he
worships), to prevent any unwelcome surprises later on.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Casting
Spells </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Both wizards and priests use
the same rules for casting spells. To cast a spell, the character
must first have the spell memorized. If it is not memorized, the
spell cannot be cast. The caster must be able to speak (not under the
effects of a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>silence</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell or gagged) and have both arms free. (Note that the optional
spell component rule [following section] can modify these
conditions.) If the spell is targeted on a person, place, or thing,
the caster must be able to see the target. It is not enough to cast a
fireball 150 feet ahead into the darkness; the caster must be able to
see the point of explosion and the intervening distance. Likewise, a
magic missile (which always hits its target) cannot be fired into a
group of bandits with the instruction to strike the leader; the
caster must be able to identify and see the leader.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once the casting has begun,
the character must stand still. Casting cannot be accomplished while
riding a roughly moving beast or a vehicle, unless special efforts
are made to stabilize and protect the caster. Thus, a spell cannot be
cast from the back of a galloping horse under any conditions, nor can
a wizard or priest cast a spell on the deck of a ship during a storm.
However, if the caster were below decks, protected from the wind and
surging waves, he could cast a spell. While it is not normally
possible to cast a spell from a moving chariot, a character who was
steadied and supported by others could do so. Your DM will have to
make a ruling in these types of extraordinary conditions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	During the round in which the
spell is cast, the caster cannot move to dodge attacks. Therefore, no
AC benefit from Dexterity is gained by spellcasters while casting
spells. Furthermore, if the spellcaster is struck by a weapon or
fails to make a saving throw before the spell is cast, the caster's
concentration is disrupted. The spell is lost in a fizzle of useless
energy and is wiped clean from the memory of the caster until it can
be rememorized. Spellcasters are well advised not to stand at the
front of any battle, at least if they want to be able to cast any
spells!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Spell
Components (Optional Rule) </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When your character casts a
spell, it is assumed that he is doing something to activate that
spell. He may utter a few words, wave his hand around a couple of
times, wiggle his toes, swallow a live spider, etc. But, under the
standard rules, you don't have to know exactly what he does to
activate the spell. Some of this can be answered if your DM uses the
rules for spell components.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The actions required to cast
a spell are divided into three groups: verbal, somatic (gestures),
and material. Each spell description (found in Appendices 3 and 4)
lists what combination of these components is needed to cast a spell.
Verbal components require the caster to speak clearly (not be
silenced in any way); somatic components require free gestures (thus,
the caster cannot be bound or held); material components must be
tossed, dropped, burned, eaten, broken, or whatever for the spell to
work. While there is no specific description of the words and
gestures that must be performed, the material components are listed
in the spell descriptions. Some of these are common and easy to
obtain. Others represent items of great value or scarcity. Whatever
the component, it is automatically destroyed or lost when the spell
is cast, unless the spell description specifically notes otherwise.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the spell components
optional rule is used in your campaign, your wizard or priest must
have these items to cast the spell. Without them, he is helpless,
even if the spell is memorized. For simplicity of play, it is best to
assume that any spellcaster with any sense has a supply of the common
items he is likely to need--wax, feathers, paint, sand, sticks, and
fluff, for example. For expensive and rare items, it is perfectly
proper for your DM to insist that special efforts be made to obtain
these items. After all, you simply cannot assume your character has a
valuable pearl handy whenever he needs one!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The three different aspects
of spell components also change the conditions under which your
character can cast his spells. No longer does he need to be able to
speak, move, and use some item. He only needs to fulfill the required
components. Thus, a spell with only a verbal component could be used
by a naked, bound spellcaster. One requiring only gestures could be
cast even within the radius of a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>silence</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell. Most spells require a combination of components, but clever
spellcasters often create new spells that need only a word or a
gesture, enabling them to take their enemies by surprise.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Magical
Research </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">One oft-ignored asset of both
wizards and priests is magical research. While the spell lists for
both groups offer a wide variety of tools and effects, the clever
player character can quickly get an edge by researching his own
spells. Where other spellcasters may fall quickly into tired and
predictable patterns (&quot;Look, it's a wizard! Get ready for the
fireball, guys!&quot;), an enterprising character can deliver sudden
(and nasty) surprises!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although your DM has the
rules for handling spell research, there are some things you should
know about how to proceed. First and foremost, research means that
you and your DM will be working together to expand the game. This is
not a job he does for you! Without your input, nothing happens.
Second, whatever your character researches, it cannot be more
powerful than the spells he is already able to cast. If it is, you
must wait until your character can cast spells of an equal power.
(Thus, as a 1st-level wizard, you cannot research a spell that is as
powerful as a fireball. You must wait until your character can cast a
fireball.) Finally, you will have to be patient and willing to have
your character spend some money. He won't create the spell
immediately, as research takes time. It also takes money, so you can
expect your DM to use this opportunity to relieve your character of
some of that excess cash. But, after all, how better for a
spellcaster to spend his money?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Knowing these things, you
should first write up a description of the spell you want to create.
Be sure to include information on components, saving throws, range,
duration, and all the other entries you find in the normal spell
listings. When you give your DM the written description, tell him
what you want the spell to do. (Sometimes what you write isn't really
what you mean, and talking to your DM is a good way to prevent
confusion.) After this, he will either accept or reject your spell.
This is his choice and not all DMs will have the same answer. Don't
kick and complain; find out what changes are needed to make the spell
acceptable. You can probably iron out the differences.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once all these things are
done, your character can research the spell. Be ready for this to
take some time. Eventually he will succeed, although the spell may
not do quite what he expected. Your DM may revise the spell, perhaps
reducing the area of effect or damage inflicted. Finally, all you
have to do is name your spell. This should be something suitably
pompous, such as &quot;Delsenora's Malevolent Steamroller.&quot;
After all, you want something to impress the locals!</font></p>
<p class="western" >

<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Spell
Descriptions </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>	</b></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
spells are organized according to their group (priest or wizard) and
level, listed in Appendices 3 and 4. Within each level, the spells
are arranged alphabetically. At the start of each spell description
is the following important game information:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Name:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Each spell is
identified by name. In parentheses after the name is the school (for
wizard spells) to which that spell belongs. When more than one is
listed, that spell is common to all schools given.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some spells are reversible
(they can be cast for an effect opposite to that of the standard
spell). This is noted after the spell name. Priests with reversible
spells must memorize the desired version. For example, a priest who
desires a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>cause
light wounds</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell
must petition for this form of the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>cure
light wounds</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell
when meditating and praying. Note that severe penalties can result if
the spell choice is at variance with the priest's alignment (possible
penalties include denial of specific spells, entire spell levels, or
even all spells for a certain period). The exact result (if any)
depends on the reaction of the priest's patron deity, as determined
by the DM.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Reversible wizard spells
operate similarly. When the spell is learned, both forms are recorded
in the wizard's spell books. However, the wizard must decide which
version of the spell he desires to cast when memorizing the spell,
unless the spell description specifically states otherwise. For
example, a wizard who has memorized </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>stone
to flesh</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> and
desires to cast </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>flesh
to stone</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> must wait
until the latter form of the spell can be memorized (i.e., rest eight
hours and study). If he could memorize two 6th-level spells, he could
memorize each version once or one version twice.</font></p>

spell belongs. For wizard spells, this defines which spells a wizard
specialist can learn, depending on the wizard's school of
specialization. For priest spells, the school notation is used only
for reference purposes, to indicate which school the spell is
considered to belong to, in case the DM needs to know for spell
resistance (for example, elves' resistance to charm spells).</font></p>

means the caster can use the spell on others if he can physically
touch them. Unless otherwise specified, all other spells are centered
on a point visible to the caster and within the range of the spell.
The point can be a creature or object if desired. In general, a spell
that affects a limited number of creatures within an area affects
those closest to the center of the area first, unless there are other
parameters operating (such as level or Hit Dice). Spells can be cast
through narrow openings only if both the caster's vision and the
spell energy can be directed simultaneously through the opening. A
wizard standing behind an arrow slit can cast through it; sending a
fireball through a small peephole he is peering through is another
matter.</font></p>

have a variable duration. In most cases, the caster cannot choose the
duration of spells. Spells with set durations (for example, 3
rounds/level) must be kept track of by the player. Spells of variable
duration (for example, 3 + 1d4 rounds) are secretly rolled and
recorded by the DM. Your DM may warn you when spell durations are
approaching expiration, but there is usually no sign that a spell is
going to expire; check with your DM to determine exactly how he
handles this issue.</font></p>

at will by the caster. In order to dismiss these spells, the original

Delsenora casts a spell that takes one round, it goes into effect at

and possessions are assumed to make their saving throws against
special attacks if the creature makes its saving throw, unless the

throw, or if the attack form is particularly potent, the possessions

DMG) or the being's saving throw. The DM will inform you when this
happens.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Any character can voluntarily
forgo a saving throw. This allows a spell or similar attack that
normally grants a saving throw to have full effect on the character.
Likewise, any creature can voluntarily lower its magic resistance
allowing a spell to automatically function when cast on it. Forgoing
a saving throw or magic resistance roll need not always be voluntary.
If a creature or character can be tricked into lowering its
resistance, the spell will have full effect, even if it is not the
spell the victim believed he was going to receive. The victim must
consciously choose to lower his resistance; it is not sufficient that
he is caught off guard. For example, a character would receive a
saving throw if a wizard in the party suddenly attacked him with a
fireball, even if the wizard had been friendly to that point.
However, the same character would not receive a saving throw if the
wizard convinced him that he was about to receive a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>levitation</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">

lowered their resistances. You must tell your DM when your character
is voluntarily lowering his resistance.</font></p>

bravely set out and survived his first adventure, the player will
have experienced the entertainment of role-playing games. But what
will the character have gained? If the character never improves, he
will never be able to survive, let alone overcome the powerful
dangers that fill the AD&amp;D game worlds.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">		Fortunately, this isn't the
case. Every time a character goes on an adventure he learns
something. He may learn a little more about his physical limits,
encounter a creature he has never seen before, try a spell as yet
unused, or discover a new peculiarity of nature. Indeed, not all his
learning experience need be positive. After blowing up half his party
with a poorly placed fireball, a wizard may (though there is no
guarantee) learn to pay more attention to ranges and areas of effect.
After charging a basilisk, a fighter may learn that caution is a
better tactic for dealing with the beast (provided the other
characters can change him from stone back to flesh). Regardless of
the method, the character has managed to learn something.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some of the information and
skills learned in the game can be applied directly in play. When a
wizard toasts his friends with a badly cast fireball, the player
learns to pay more attention to the area of effect of a fireball.
Though the player made the mistake and his character only carried out
the actions, the player's friends will also learn to keep their
characters well away from his.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The reward for this type of
learning is direct and immediate. The characters benefit because each
of the players has a better understanding of what to do or where to
go</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, a character also
improves by increasing his power. Although the player can improve his
play, he cannot arbitrarily give his character more hit points, more
spells, or a better chance to hit with an attack. These gains are
made by earning experience points (XP).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	An experience point is a
concrete measure of a character's improvement. It represents a host
of abstract factors: increased confidence, physical exercise,
insight, and on-the-job training. When a character earns enough
experience points to advance to the next experience level, these
abstract factors translate into a measurable improvement in the
abilities of the character. Just what areas improve and how quickly
improvement occurs all depend on the character's class.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Group
Experience Awards </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Experience points are earned
through the activities of the characters, which generally relate to
their adventuring goals. Thus, all characters on an adventure receive
some experience points for overcoming their enemies or obstacles.
Since group cooperation is important, experience points for defeating
foes are given to all members of the group, regardless of their
actions. Who is to say that the wizard, standing ready with a spell
just in case things got ugly, might not have been necessary? Or that
the bard who covered the party's escape route wasn't doing something
important? A character who never hefts a sword may still have good
advice or important suggestions on better tactics. Furthermore, the
wizard and the bard can also learn from the actions of others.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Individual
Experience Awards </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Player characters also earn
experience points for individual deeds, as determined by their class.
Generally, each character earns points for doing actions appropriate
to his group. Warriors earn additional experience points for
defeating creatures. The more difficult the battle, the greater the
number of experience points. Wizards earn points for using their
spells for specific purposes. The wizard who walks into the woods and
casts his spells for no reason doesn't gain experience points; the
wizard who casts a lightning bolt at a beholder has used his spell
for a purpose. He gains experience points. Wizards also earn
experience points for researching new spells and creating magical
items. Priests can earn experience points for researching new spells
and creating magical items. Priests can earn experience points by
spreading their beliefs and using their powers in service of their
deity. Rogues, who tend to have a larcenous streak, earn experience
points by using their special abilities and finding or earning gold.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A character can also earn
experience for the player's actions, such as playing the game well.
When a player does a good job creating and pretending to be his
character, the DM may give the character experience points for good
role-playing. If the player is really involved and takes a major part
in the game, the DM can give the player's character extra experience
points. If the player uses his head to come up with a really good
idea, the DM can give the character experience points for his
contribution.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, a character can earn
experience points for successfully completing an adventure or
achieving a goal the DM has set. Although a player may have a pretty
good idea of what his character is supposed to accomplish, he won't
know if he'll be awarded experience points for it until his character
actually receives them. However, there is no rule that the DM must be
consistent in these awards, or even that he must give a character
anything at all.</font></p>

<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Training
</b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Even when a character has
earned enough experience to attain the next level, the DM may not
allow immediate advancement. He may require the character to receive
training to advance. When training, a character studies his skills
under a tutor, taking the raw knowledge he has gained and honing it
into measurable improvement. On the average, this takes a few weeks
(depending on the tutor's ability), and it is normally done during
the character's nonadventuring time.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A DM can also rule that the
circumstances are not appropriate for the character to advance in
level, such as when the game session ends with the characters deep in
an abandoned mine complex. The party has just finished a battle with
a band of gnolls and faces more such encounters before it can reach
the surface. The DM rules that the characters receive no experience
until they leave the mines, because he doesn't want them to increase
in level in the middle of the adventure. He is perfectly justified in
doing this. And if the characters live through the adventure, they
will undoubtedly profit from it, either in experience points or
knowledge gained.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The AD&amp;D game is an
adventure game designed to give players a feeling of excitement and
danger. Characters brave the unknown perils of moldering dungeons and
thorn-covered wilderness, facing off against hideous monsters and
evil villains. Thus, it is important for all players to know the
basic rules for handling combat.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To create the proper sense of
danger and excitement, the rules for combat must be thorough, but
they must also be playable and exciting enough to create a vivid
picture in the minds of the players. Combat in the AD&amp;D game has
to allow many different actions and outcomes--as many as the
imagination can produce. Knowing that anything could happen next
(because the rules allow it) creates excitement for everyone.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As important as fighting is
to the AD&amp;D game, it isn't the be-all and end-all of play. It's
just one way for characters to deal with situations. If characters
could do nothing but fight, the game would quickly get boring--every
encounter would be the same. Because there is more to the game than
fighting, we'll cover much more than simple hack-and-slash combat in
this chapter.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition to explaining the

</b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Many game terms are used
throughout the combat rules. To understand the rules, players must
understand these terms, so brief explanations appear below. Further
details are provided throughout this chapter.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Armor
Class (AC)</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">is the
protective rating of a type of armor. In some circumstances, AC is
modified by the amount of protection gained or lost because of the
character's situation. For instance, crouching behind a boulder
improves a character's Armor Class, while being attacked from behind
worsens his AC.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Armor provides protection by
reducing the chance that a character is attacked successfully (and
suffers damage). Armor does not absorb damage, it prevents it. A
fighter in full plate mail may be a slow-moving target, but
penetrating his armor to cause any damage is no small task.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Armor Class is measured on a
scale from 10, the worst (no armor), to -10, the best (very powerful
magical armors). </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>The
lower the number, the more effective the armor.</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
Shields can also improve the AC of a character (see &quot;Shields&quot;
in Chapter 6: Money and Equipment).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Abilities and situations can
also affect a character's Armor Class. High Dexterity gives a bonus
to Armor Class, for example. But even a character with a Dexterity
bonus can have this bonus negated if he is attacked from the rear.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Damage</b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
is what happens to a character when an opponent attacks him
successfully. Damage can also occur as a result of poison, fire,
falling, acid, and anything even remotely dangerous in the real
world. Damage from most attacks is measured in </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>hit
points.</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> Each time a
character is hit, he suffers points of damage. It could be as little
as 1 point to as many as 80 or more. These points are subtracted from
the character's current hit point total. When this reaches 0, the
character is dead.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Initiative</b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
determines the order in which things happen in a combat round. Like
so many things in the world, initiative is determined by a
combination of ability, situation, and chance.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the start of each round of
a battle, an initiative roll is made by both sides. This roll can be
modified by the abilities of the combatants and by the situation. The
person or side with the lower modified die roll acts first.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Melee</b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
is any situation in which characters are battling each other
hand-to-hand, whether with fists, teeth, claws, swords, axes, pikes,
or something else. Strength and Dexterity are valuable assets in
melee.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Missile
combat</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">is defined as
any time a weapon is shot, thrown, hurled, kicked, or otherwise
propelled. Missile and melee combat have the same basic rules, but
there are special situations and modifiers that apply only to missile
combat.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Saving
throws</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">are measures of
a character's resistance to special types of attacks--poisons, magic,
and attacks that affect the whole body or mind of the character. The
ability to make successful saving throws improves as the character
increases in level; Dexterity and general mental fortitude aid in
honing combat senses. Experience makes saving throws easier.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Surprise</b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
can happen any time characters meet another group unexpectedly
(monsters, evil knights, peasants, etc.). Surprise is simply what
happens when one side--a person or party--is taken unawares, unable
to react until they gather their wits. Their opponents, if
unsurprised, are allowed a bonus round of action while the surprised
characters recover. It's entirely possible for both sides in a given
situation to be surprised!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Attacking with surprise gives
bonuses to the attack roll (see Table 51). A surprised character also
has a decreased chance of rolling a successful saving throw, if one
is needed.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Surprise is determined by a
die roll and is normally checked at the beginning of an encounter.
Surprise is very unpredictable, so there are very few modifiers to
the roll.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>THAC0</b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
is an acronym for &quot;To Hit Armor Class 0.&quot; This is the
number a character, NPC, or monster needs to attack an Armor Class 0
target successfully. THAC0 depends on a character's group and level
(see Table 53). The THAC0 number can be used to calculate the number
needed to hit any Armor Class. THAC0 is refigured each time a
character increases in level. Using THAC0 speeds the play of combat
greatly.</font></p>

<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>The
Attack Roll </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">At the heart of the combat
system is the attack roll. This is the die roll that determines
whether an attack succeeds or fails. The number a player needs in
order to make a successful attack roll is also called the &quot;to-hit&quot;
number.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Attack rolls are used for
attacks with swords, bows, rocks, and other weapons, as well as blows
from fists, tackling, and other hand-to-hand attacks. Attack rolls
are also used to resolve a variety of potentially injury-causing
actions that require accuracy (for example, throwing a rock at a
small target or tossing a sword to a party member in the middle of a
fight).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Figuring
the To-Hit Number </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The first step in making an
attack roll is to find the number needed to hit the target. Subtract
the Armor Class of the target from the attacker's THAC0. (Remember
that if the Armor Class is a negative number, you </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>add</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
it to the attacker's THAC0.) The character has to roll the resulting
number, or higher, on 1d20 to hit the target.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>	Rath has reached 7th level
as a fighter. His THAC0 is 14 (found on Table 53), meaning he needs
to roll a 14 or better to hit a character or creature of Armor Class
0. In combat, Rath, attacking an orc wearing chainmail armor (AC 6),
needs to roll an 8 (14-6=8) to hit the orc. An 8 or higher on 1d20
will hit the orc. If Rath hits, he rolls the appropriate dice (see
Table 44) to determine how much damage he inflicts.</i></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The example above is quite
simple--in a typical AD&amp;D game combat situation, THAC0 is
modified by weapon bonuses, Strength bonuses, and the like (the next
section &quot;Modifiers to the Attack Roll,&quot; lists the specifics
of these modifiers). Figure Strength and weapon modifiers, subtract
the total from the base THAC0, and record this modified THAC0 with
each weapon on the character sheet. Subtract the target's Armor Class
from this modified THAC0 when determining the to-hit number.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>	Rath is still a 7th-level
fighter. He has a Strength of 18/80 (which gives him a +2 bonus to
his attack roll). He fights with a long sword +1. His THAC0 is 14,
modified to 12 by his Strength and to 11 by his weapon. If attacking
the orc from the earlier example, Rath would have to roll a 5 or
higher on 1d20 in order to hit (11-6=5). Again, table 44 would tell
him how much damage he inflicts with his weapon (this information
should also be written on his character sheet).</i></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM may also throw in
situational modifiers, (for example, a bonus if the target is struck
from behind, or a penalty if the target is crouching behind a
boulder). If the final, modified die roll on 1d20 is equal to or
greater than the number needed to hit the target, the attack
succeeds. If the roll is lower than that needed, the attack fails.</font></p>

to the Attack Roll </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In combat, many factors can
modify the number a character needs for a successful hit. These
variables are reflected in modifiers to the to-hit number or to the
attack roll.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Strength

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A character's
Strength can modify the die roll, altering both the chance to hit and
the damage caused. This modifier is always applied to melees and
attacks with hurled missile weapons (a spear or an axe).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A positive Strength modifier
can be applied to bows if the character has a special bow made for
him, designed to take advantage of his high Strength. Characters with
Strength penalties always suffer them when using a bow weapon. They
simply are not able to draw back the bowstring far enough. Characters
never have Strength modifiers when using crossbows--the power of the
shot is imparted by a machine, not the player character.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Magical
items:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The magical
properties of a weapon can also modify combat. Items that impart a
bonus to the attack roll or Armor Class are identified by a plus
sign. For example, a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>sword
+1</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> improves a
character's chance to hit by one. A suit of </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>chain
mail +1</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> improves
the Armor Class of the character by one (which means you </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>subtract</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
one from the character's AC, changing an AC of 5 to an AC of 4, for
example). Cursed items have a negative modifier (a penalty),
resulting in a subtraction from the attack roll or an addition to
Armor Class.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There is no limit to the
number of modifiers that can be applied to a single die roll. Nor is
there a limit to the positive or negative number (the total of all
modifiers) that can be applied to a die roll.</font></p>

same. If they did, there would be no need for the wide variety of
weapons that exists. Only one form of each weapon type, the most
useful one, would be used throughout the world. This is obviously not
the case.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Aside from the differences in
size, weight, length, and shape, certain types of weapons are more
useful against some types of armor than others. Indeed, the different
armors and weapons of the world are the result of an ancient arms
race. Every new weapon led to the development of a new type of armor
designed to counter it. This led to new weapons, which led to new
armor, and so on.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In the AD&amp;D game, weapons
fall into several categories, based on how they are used. The basic
categories are slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning.</font></p>

axes, and knives. Damage is caused by the combination of weight,
muscle, and a good sharp edge.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">(some swords,
spears, pikes, arrows, javelins, etc.) rely on the penetrating power
of a single sharp point and much less on the weight of the weapon.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A few weapons, particularly
some of the more exotic polearms, fall into more than one of these
categories. A halberd can be used as a pole-axe (a slashing weapon)
or as a short pike (a piercing weapon). The versatility of these
weapons provides the user with a combat advantage, in that the mode
most favorable to the attacker can be used, depending upon the
situation.</font></p>

To-Hit Numbers </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes the attacker's
to-hit number seems impossible to roll. An attack may be so difficult
it requires a roll greater than 20 (on a 20-sided die!), or so
ridiculously easy it can be made on a roll less than 1. In both
cases, an attack roll is still required!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The reason is simple: With
positive die roll modifiers (for magic, Strength, situation, or
whatever), a number greater than 20 can be rolled. Likewise, die roll
penalties can push the attack roll below 0.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	No matter what number a
character needs to hit, a roll of 20 is </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>always</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
considered a hit and a roll of 1 is </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>always</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
a miss, unless the DM rules otherwise. Under most circumstances, a
natural 20 hits and a natural 1 misses, regardless of any modifiers
applied to the die roll.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thus, even if a character's
chance to hit a monster is 23 and the character has a -3 penalty
applied to the die roll, he might be able to score a hit--but only if
the die roll is a 20 before any modifiers are applied. Likewise, a
character able to hit a monster on a 3 or better, waving a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>sword
+4</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">, could still
miss if a 1 is rolled on the die.</font></p>

character's THAC0 must be known. This depends on the group and level,
if the attacker is a player character or NPC, or the Hit Dice if the

and Encounters </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Encounters are the heart of
the AD&amp;D game. Since encounters with monsters and NPCs often lead
to combat, an understanding of what happens during battles is vital
for everyone. There are several factors the DM will consider in any
combat, most of which arise from the circumstances of the encounter.
Is anyone surprised? How far apart are the opponents? How many of
them are there? Answers to these questions are found in the Encounter
section of the DMG. These are questions common to all encounters,
whether combat occurs or not.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>The
Combat Round </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If an encounter escalates into
a combat situation, the time scale of the game automatically goes to
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>rounds</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
(also called melee rounds or combat rounds). Rounds are used to
measure the actions of characters in combat (or other intensive
actions in which time is important).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A round is approximately one
minute long. Ten combat rounds equal a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>turn</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
(or, put another way, a turn equals 10 minutes of game time). This is
particularly important to remember for spells that last for turns,
rather than rounds.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But these are just
approximations--precise time measurements are impossible to make in
combat. An action that might be ridiculously easy under normal
circumstances could become an undertaking of truly heroic scale when
attempted in the middle of a furious, chaotic battle.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Imagine the simple act of
imbibing a healing potion. First, a character decides to drink the
potion before retiring for the night. All he has to do is get it out
of his backpack, uncork it, and drink the contents. No problem.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now imagine the same thing in
the middle of a fight. The potion is safely stowed in the character's
backpack. First, he takes stock of the situation to see if anyone
else can get the potion out for him, but, not surprisingly, everyone
is rather busy. So, sword in one hand, he shrugs one strap of the
pack off his shoulder. Then, just as two orcs leap toward him, the
other strap threatens to slip down, entangling his sword arm. Already
the loose strap keeps him from fully using his shield.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Holding the shield as best as
possible in front of him, he scrambles backward to avoid the
monsters' first wild swings. He gets pushed back a few more feet when
a companion shoulders past to block their advance. His companion
bought him a little time, so he kneels, lays down his sword, and
slips the backpack all the way off. Hearing a wild cry, he
instinctively swings his shield up just in time to ward off a
glancing blow.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Rummaging through the pack,
he finally finds the potion, pulls it out, and, huddling behind his
shield, works the cork free. Just then there is a flash of flame all
around him--a fireball! He grits his teeth against the heat, shock,
and pain and tries to remember not to crush or spill the potion vial.
Biting back the pain of the flames, he is relieved to see the potion
is still intact.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Quickly, he gulps it down,
reclaims his sword, kicks his backpack out of the way, and runs back
up to the front line. In game terms, the character withdrew, was
missed by one attacker, made a successful saving throw vs. spell
(from the fireball), drank a potion, and was ready for combat the
next round.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">What You
Can Do in One Round </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Whatever the precise length
of a combat round, a character can accomplish only one basic action
in that round, be it making an attack, casting a spell, drinking a
potion, or tending to a fallen comrade. The basic action, however,
may involve several lesser actions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When making an attack, a
character is likely to close with his opponent, circle for an
opening, feint here, jab there, block a thrust, leap back, and
perhaps finally make a telling blow. A spellcaster may fumble for his
components, dodge an attacker, mentally review the steps of the
spell, intone the spell, and then move to safety when it is all done.
It has already been shown what drinking a potion might entail. All of
these things might happen in a bit less than a minute or a bit more,
but the standard is one minute and one action to the round.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some examples of the actions
a character can accomplish include the following:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Make an attack (make attack
rolls up to the maximum number allowed the character class at a given
level)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• Cast one spell (if the
casting time is one round or less)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• Drink a potion</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• Light a torch</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• Use a magical item</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• Move to the limit of his
movement rate</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• Attempt to open a stuck
or secret door</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• Bind a character's
wounds</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• Search a body</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• Hammer in a spike</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	• Recover a dropped weapon</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are also actions that
take a negligible amount of time, things the character does without
affecting his ability to perform a more important task. Examples of
these include the following:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 • <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Shout warnings, brief
instructions, or demands for surrender, but not conversations where a
reply is expected.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
 • <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Change weapons by
dropping one and drawing another.</font></p>

Combat Sequence </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In real life, combat is one of
the closest things to pure anarchy. Each side is attempting to harm
the other, essentially causing disorder and chaos. Thus, combats are
filled with unknowns--unplanned events, failed attacks, lack of
communication, and general confusion and uncertainty. However, to
play a battle in the game, it is necessary to impose some order on
the actions that occur. Within a combat round, there is a set series
of steps that must be followed. These steps are:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	1.	The DM decides what
actions the monsters or NPCs will take, including casting spells (if
any).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	2.	The players indicate what
their characters will do, including casting spells (if any).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	3.	Initiative is determined.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	4.	Attacks are made in order
of initiative.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	These steps are followed
until the combat ends--either one side is defeated, surrenders, or
runs away.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>NPC/Monster
Determination:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In the first
step, the DM secretly decides in general terms what each opponent
will do--attack, flee, or cast a spell. He does not announce his
decisions to the players. If a spell is to be cast, the DM picks the
spell before the players announce their characters' actions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Player
Determination:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Next, the
players give a general indication of what their characters are
planning to do. This does not have to be perfectly precise and can be
changed somewhat, if the DM decides circumstances warrant.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the characters are
battling goblins, a player can say, &quot;My fighter will attack&quot;
without having to announce which goblin he will strike. If the
characters are battling a mixed group of goblins and ogres, the
player has to state whether his character is attacking goblins or
ogres.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Spells to be cast must also
be announced at this time and cannot be changed once the initiative
die is rolled.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before moving on, the DM will
make sure he has a clear idea of not only what the player characters
are doing, but also what actions any hirelings and henchmen are
taking. Once he has a clear view of everything that's likely to
happen, the DM can overrule any announced action that violates the
rules (or in the case of an NPC, is out of character).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He is not required to
overrule an impossible action, but he can let a character attempt it
anyway, knowing full well the character cannot succeed. It is not the
DM's position to advise players on the best strategies, most
intelligent actions, or optimum maneuvers for their characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Initiative:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In the third
step, dice are rolled to determine initiative, according to the rules
for initiative (see &quot;Initiative&quot; below).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Resolution:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In the last
step, PCs, NPCs, and monsters make their attacks, spells occur, and
any other actions are resolved according to the order of initiative.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

using a single initiative roll for everyone on the same side is too
unrealistic. It is, admittedly, a simplification, a way to keep down
the number of die rolls required in a single round, allowing for much
faster combat. However, the actions of different characters, the
types of weapons they use, and the situation can all be factors in
determining initiative.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Using this optional method,
one initiative die roll is still made for each side in the fight.
However, more modifiers are applied to this roll, according to the
actions of individual characters. These modifiers are listed on Table
56.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some of the modifiers depend
on ability, spell, and weapon. Characters casting spells (but not
monsters using innate abilities) must add the spellcasting time to
the die roll. Characters attacking with weapons add the weapons'
speed factors to the die roll (see the equipment lists in Chapter 6:
Money and Equipment). All other modifiers are applied according to
each individual's situation.</font></p>

multiples--using the same weapon more than once--as in the case of a
highly skilled fighter, the attacks are staggered. Everyone involved
in the combat completes one action before the second (or subsequent)
attack roll is made.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Take, for example, a fighter
who can attack twice per round, and say he's battling creatures that
can only make one attack. The fighter wins initiative. He makes his
first attack according to the rolled initiative order. Then each
creature gets its attack. Finally, the fighter gets his second
attack.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If fighters on both sides in
a battle were able to attack twice in the round, their first attacks
would occur according to the initiative roll. Their second attacks
would come after all other attacks, and would then alternate
according to the initiative roll.</font></p>

and Initiative </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Casting times for spells can
modify initiative rolls, creating a realistic delay for the
spellcaster. When a spell's &quot;Casting Time&quot; parameter is
given as a number without any units (for example, rounds or turns),
then that number is added to the caster's initiative roll to
determine his modified initiative. When a spell requires a round or
more to cast, a normal initiative roll is not made--a spell requiring
one round to cast takes effect at the end of the current round, after
all other actions are completed.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Spells that require more than
one round to cast involve some bookkeeping. The DM or one of the
players must keep track of the rounds spent in casting. If the
spellcasting character is disturbed during this time, the spell is
lost. If all goes well, the spell takes effect at the very end of the
last round of the required casting time. Thus, a spell requiring 10
minutes to cast would require 10 combat rounds, and wouldn't take
effect until the very end of the 10th round.</font></p>

Speed and Initiative (Optional Rule) </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Each time a character swings
a weapon, he places himself out of position to make his next attack.
Swinging a hammer is not as simple as tapping in a nail. A war hammer
is heavy. Swing it in one direction and it pulls in that direction.
It has to be brought under control and repositioned before it can be
swung again. The user must regain his balance and plant his feet
firmly. Only after doing all this is he ready for his next attack.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Compare how quickly someone
can throw a punch to the amount of time required to swing a chair to
get a good idea of what weapon speed factors are about.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Weapon speed factors slow the
speed of a character's attack. The higher the weapon speed factor,
the heavier, clumsier, or more limited the weapon is. For the most
part, weapon speed factors apply to all creatures using manufactured
weapons. The speed factor of a weapon is added to the initiative roll
of the character to get his modified initiative roll.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thus, if the DM decides to
use weapon speed factors for player characters, they should also be
used for giants, orcs, centaurs, and the like. Otherwise the DM isn't
being fair to the players. However, creatures with natural weapons
are not affected by weapon speed. Their attacks are natural
extensions of their bodies, giving them much faster recovery and
reaction times.</font></p>

Weapon Speeds</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Magical weapons are easier to
wield in combat than ordinary ones. Maybe the weapon is lighter or
better balanced than normal; maybe it just pulls the character into
the proper position of its own volition. Whatever the cause, each
bonus point conferred by a magical weapon reduces the speed factor of
that weapon by 1. (A </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>sword
+3</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> reduces the
weapon speed factor by 3, for example.) When a weapon has two
bonuses, the lesser one is used. No weapon can have a speed factor of
less than 0.</font></p>

with Two Weapons </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A tricky fighting style
available only to warriors and rogues is that of fighting with two
weapons simultaneously. The character chooses not to use a shield in
favor of another weapon, granting him a greater number of attacks,
with a penalty to his attack rolls (rangers are exempt from the
attack roll penalty).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When using a second weapon in
his off-hand, a character is limited in his weapon choice. His
principal weapon can be whatever he chooses, provided it can be
wielded with one hand. The second weapon must be smaller in size and
weight than the character's main weapon (though a dagger can always
be used as a second weapon, even if the primary weapon is also a
dagger). A fighter can use a long sword and a short sword, or a long
sword and a dagger, but he cannot use two long swords. Nor can the
character use a shield, unless it is kept strapped onto his back.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When attacking, all
characters but rangers suffer penalties to their attack rolls.
Attacks made with the main weapon suffer a -2 penalty, and attacks
made with the second weapon suffer a -4 penalty. The character's
Reaction Adjustment (based on his Dexterity, see Table 2) modifies
this penalty. A low Dexterity score will worsen the character's
chance to hit with each attack. A high Dexterity can negate this
particular penalty, although it </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>cannot</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
result in a positive modifier on the attack rolls for either weapon
(i.e., the Reaction Adjustment can, at best, raise the attack roll
penalties to 0).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The use of two weapons
enables the character to make one additional attack each combat
round, with the second weapon. The character gains only one
additional attack each round, regardless of the number of attacks he
may normally be allowed. Thus, a warrior able to attack 3/2 (once in
the first round and twice in the second) can attack 5/2 (twice in the
first round and three times in the second).</font></p>

in Combat </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Since a round is roughly a
minute long, it should be easy for a character to move just about
anywhere he wants during the course of the round. After all,
Olympic-class sprinters can cover vast amounts of ground in a minute.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, a character in an
AD&amp;D game is    not an Olympic sprinter running in a straight
line. He is trying to maneuver through a battle without getting
killed. He is keeping his eyes open for trouble, avoiding surprise,
watching his back, watching the backs of his partners, and looking
for a good opening, while simultaneously planning his next move,
sometimes through a haze of pain. He may be carrying a load of
equipment that slows him down significantly. Because of all these
things, the distance a character can move is significantly less than
players generally think.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In a combat round, a being
can move up to 10 times its movement rating (see Chapter 14: Time and
Movement) in feet. Thus, if a character has a movement rating of 9,
he can move up to 90 feet in a round. However, the types of moves a
character can make during combat are somewhat limited.</font></p>

in Melee </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The basic move is to get
closer for combat--i.e., move close enough to an enemy to attack.
This is neither a blind rush nor a casual stroll. Instead, the
character approaches quickly but with caution. When closing for
combat, a character can move up to half his allowed distance and
still make a melee attack.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Rather than slug it out toe
to toe with an opponent, a character can move up to one-half his
normal movement rate and engage in missile fire at half his normal
rate of fire. Thus, a man capable of moving 120 feet and armed with a
long bow (two shots per round, under normal circumstances) could move
60 feet and still fire one shot. The same man, armed with a heavy
crossbow (one shot every other round) would be able to shoot only
once every four rounds while on the move.</font></p>

an Opponent </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A character can also charge a
foe. A charge increases the character's movement rate by 50% and
enables the character to make an attack at the end of his movement. A
charging character also gains a +2 bonus to his attack roll, mainly
from momentum. Certain weapons (such as a lance) inflict double the
rolled damage in a charge.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, charging gives the
opponents several advantages. First, they gain a -2 bonus to their
initiative rolls. Second, charging characters gain no Dexterity
bonuses to Armor Class and they suffer an AC penalty of 1. Finally,
if the defender is using a spear or polearm weapon and sets it
against the charge (bracing the butt against a stone or his foot), he
inflicts double damage on a successful hit.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Punching occurs when a

requires both hands free, unencumbered by shields and the like.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When punching or wrestling, a
normal attack roll is made. The normal Armor Class of the target is
used. If a character is attempting to wrestle in armor, the modifiers
on Table 57 are used (these are penalties to the attacker's attack

The only concern is to pin and restrain him.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To overbear an opponent, a
normal attack roll is made. For every level of size difference (1 if
a Large attacker takes on a Medium defender, for example), the attack
roll is modified by 4 (+4 if the attacker is larger; -4 if the
defender is larger).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The defender also gains a
benefit if it has more than two legs: a -2 penalty to the attacker's
roll for every leg beyond two. There is no penalty to the defender if
it has no legs. A lone orc attempting to pull down a horse and rider
would have at least a -8 penalty applied to the attack roll (-4 for
size and -4 for the horse's four legs).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the attack succeeds, the
opponent is pulled down. A character can be pinned if further
successful overbearing attacks are rolled each round. For pinning
purposes, do not use the prone modifier to combat (from Table 51).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If multiple attackers are all
attempting to pull down a single target, make only one attack roll
with a +1 bonus for each attacker beyond the first. Always use the
to-hit number of the weakest attacker to figure the chance of
success, since cooperation always depends on the weakest link.
Modifiers for size should be figured for the largest attacker of the
group.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A giant and three pixies
attempting to pull down a man would use the pixies' attack roll,

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Many spells used by priests
and wizards take effect only when the target is touched by the
caster. Under normal circumstances, this is no problem--the
spellcaster reaches out and touches the recipient. However, if the

The wizard or priest calculates his to-hit number normally, according
to the intended victim's Armor Class and other protections. The DM

the spell!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Whenever a touch spell is
successful, the spellcaster suffers from any special defenses of his
target, if they are continually in operation. A successful touch to a

in serious burns.</font></p>

Weapons in Combat </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In general, missile combat is
handled identically to standard melee. Intentions are announced,
initiative is rolled, and attack rolls are made. However, there are
some special rules and situations that apply only to missile combat.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Missile weapons are divided
into two general categories. The first includes all standard,
direct-fire, single-target missiles--slings, arrows, quarrels,
spears, throwing axes, and the like.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The second category includes
all grenade-like missiles that have an area effect, no matter how
small. Thus, an attack with these weapons does not have to hit its
target directly to have a chance of affecting it. Included in this
group are small flasks of oil, acid, poison, holy water, potions, and
boulders. Hurled boulders are included because they bounce and bound
along after they hit, leaving a swath of destruction.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Range </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The first step in making a
missile attack is to find the range from the attacker to the target.
This is measured in yards from one point to the other. This distance
is compared to the range categories for the weapon used (see Table 45
in Chapter 6: Combat).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the distance is greater
than the long range given, the target is out of range; if the
distance is between the long- and medium-range numbers, the target is
at long range; when between the medium- and short-range numbers,
medium range is used; when equal to or less than the short-range
distance, the target is at short range.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Short-range attacks suffer no
range modifier. Medium-range attacks suffer a -2 penalty to the
attack roll. Long-range attacks suffer a -5 penalty. Some weapons
have no short range since they must arc a certain distance before
reaching their target. These attacks are always made with an attack
roll penalty.</font></p>

Fire </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Bows, crossbows, and many
other missile weapons have different rates of fire (ROF)--the number
of missiles they can shoot in a single round.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Small, light weapons can be
thrown very quickly, so up to three darts can be thrown in a single
round. Arrows can be nocked and let loose almost as quickly, so up to
two shots can be fired in a single round.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some weapons (such as heavy
crossbows) take a long time to load and can be fired only every other
round.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Whatever the ROF, multiple
missile shots are handled the same way as other multiple attacks for
the purposes of determining initiative. The ROF of each missile
weapon is listed in table 45 in Chapter 6.</font></p>

modifiers for Strength are always used when an attack is made with a
hurled weapon. Here the power of the character's arm is a significant
factor in the effectiveness of the attack.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When using a bow, the attack
roll and damage Strength modifiers apply only if the character has a
properly prepared bow (see Chapter 6: Money and Equipment).
Characters never receive Strength bonuses when using crossbows or
similar mechanical devices.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Dexterity modifiers to the

bow, crossbow, or axe but not when firing a trebuchet or other siege
engine.</font></p>

into a Melee </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Missile weapons are intended
mainly as long-range weapons. Ideally, they are used before the
opponents reach your line. However, ideal situations are all too
rare, and characters often discover that the only effective way to
attack is to shoot arrows (or whatever) at an enemy already in melee
combat with their companions. While possible, and certainly allowed,
this is a risky proposition.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When missiles are fired into
a melee, the DM counts the number of figures in the immediate area of
the intended target. Each Medium figure counts as 1. Small (S)
figures count as ½, Large as 2, Huge as 4, and Gargantuan as 6. The
total value is compared to the value of each character or creature in
the target melee. Using this ratio, the DM rolls a die to determine
who (or what) will be the target of the shot.</font></p>

There's a 1 in 8 chance that Rath is the target; a 1 in 8 chance that
Tarus is hit; and a 6 in 8 chance the shot hits the giant. The DM
could roll an 8-sided die to determine who gets hit, or he could
reduce the ratios to a percentage (75% chance the giant is hit, etc.)

Cover Against Missile Fire </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One of the best ways to avoid
being hit and injured is to hide behind something--a wall, a tree, a
building corner, a heap of boulders, or whatever happens to be
available. Professional adventurers, wishing to make this sound
heroic, call this taking cover.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Taking cover doesn't work
particularly well in a melee, since the cover hampers defender and
attacker equally. However, it is quite an effective tactic against
missile fire.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are two types of
protection a character can have. The first is </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>concealment,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
also called soft cover. A character hiding behind a clump of bushes
is concealed. He can be seen, but only with difficulty, and it's no
easy task to determine exactly where he is. The bushes cannot stop an
arrow, but they do make it less likely that the character is hit.
Other types of concealment include curtains, tapestries, smoke, fog,
and brambles.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The other type of protection
is </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>cover,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
sometimes called, more precisely, hard cover. It is, as its name
implies, something a character can hide behind that will block a
missile. Hard cover includes stone walls, the corner of a building,
tables, doors, earth embankments, tree trunks, and magical walls of
force.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Cover helps a potential
target by giving the attacker a negative modifier to his attack roll.
The exact modifier for concealment or cover depends on the degree to
which it is being used as shelter. A character who stands behind a
two-foot wall is a pretty obvious target, especially when compared to
the character who lies down behind that wall and carefully peers over
it. Table 59 lists the different modifiers for varying degrees of
cover and concealment.</font></p>

Missiles </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Unlike standard missiles,
which target a specific creature, a grenade-like missile is aimed at
a point, whether this point is a creature or a spot on the ground.
When the attack is announced, the player indicates where he wants the
missile to land. This then becomes the target point and is used to
determine the direction and distance of any scatter.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Most grenade-like missiles
are items of opportunity or necessity--rocks, flasks of oil, vials of
holy water, or beakers of acid. As such, these items are not listed
on the equipment tables for range, ROF, and damage. The range each
can be thrown varies with the Strength of the character and the
weight of the object.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A missile of five pounds or
less can be thrown about 30 feet. Short range is 10 feet, medium
range is 20 feet, and everything beyond is maximum range. Heavier
items have reduced ranges. Just how far an object can be thrown is
decided by the DM.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Exceptionally heavy items can
be thrown only if the character rolls a successful bend bars/lift
gates check. In no case can a character throw an item heavier than
his Strength would allow him to lift. Thus, the DM can rule that a
character would have little trouble chucking a half-empty backpack
across a ten-foot chasm, but the character would need to make a check
in order to heave an orc ten feet through the air into the faces of
his orcish friends.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once a container hits, it
normally breaks immediately. However, this is not always true. Some
missiles, like soft leather flasks or hard pottery, are particularly
resistant. If there's some doubt about whether or not a thrown object
will break, the DM can require an item saving throw (this information
is in the DMG) to see if it shatters or rips, spewing its contents
everywhere.</font></p>

itself, is not a separate option under the AD&amp;D game rules.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the same time, the
assumption is that characters in combat are constantly exposing
themselves to some risk--trying to get a clear view of a target or
looking for the opening to make an attack. There are times, however,
when this is not the case. Sometimes, the only thing a character
wants to do is avoid being hit.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In order to make himself
harder to hit, a character can parry--forfeit all actions for the
round--he can't attack, move, or cast spells. This frees the
character to concentrate solely on defense. At this point, all
characters but warriors gain an AC bonus equal to half their level. A
6th-level wizard would have a +3 bonus to his AC (lowering his AC by
3). A warrior gets a bonus equal to half his level plus one. A
6th-level fighter would gain a +4 AC bonus.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Note that the benefit is not
a perfect all-around defense, and it's not effective against rear or
missile attacks. It applies only to those characters attacking the
defender with frontal melee attacks. This optional defense has no
effect against magical attacks, so it wouldn't do anything to protect
a character from the force of a lightning bolt or fireball, for
example.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>saving
throw</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> is a die roll
that gives a chance, however slim, that the character or creature
finds some way to save himself from certain destruction (or at least
lessen the damage of a successful attack).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	More often than not, the
saving throw represents an instinctive act on the part of the
character--diving to the ground just as a fireball scorches the
group, blanking the mind just as a mental battle begins, blocking the
worst of an acid spray with a shield. The exact action is not
important--DMs and players can think of lively and colorful
explanations of why a saving throw succeeded or failed. Explanations
tailored to the events of the moment enhance the excitement of the

Saving Throws </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To make a saving throw, a
player rolls a 20-sided die (1d20). The result must be equal to or
greater than the character's saving throw number. The number a
character needs to roll varies depending upon the character's group,
his level, and what the character is trying to save himself from. A
character's saving throw numbers can be found in Table 60.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Saving throws are made in a
variety of situations: For attacks involving paralyzation, poison, or
death magic; petrification or polymorph; rod, staff, or wand; breath
weapon; and spells. The type of saving throw a character must roll is
determined by the specific spell, monster, magical item, or situation
involved.</font></p>

Throw Priority </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes the type of saving
throw required by a situation or item isn't clear, or more than one
category of saving throw may seem appropriate. For this reason, the
saving throw categories in Table 60 are listed in order of
importance, beginning with paralyzation, poison, and death magic, and
ending with spells.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Imagine that Rath is struck
by the ray from a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>wand

Both a saving throw vs. wands and a saving throw vs. polymorph would
be appropriate. But Rath must roll a saving throw vs. wands because
that category has a higher priority than polymorph.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The categories of saving
throws are as follows:</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This is used
whenever a character is affected by a paralyzing attack (regardless
of source), poison (of any strength), or certain spells and magical
items that otherwise kill the character outright (as listed in their
descriptions). This saving throw can also be used in situations in
which exceptional force of will or physical fortitude are needed.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">As its name
implies, this is used whenever a character is affected by the powers
of a rod, staff, or wand, provided another save of higher priority
isn't called for. This saving throw is sometimes specified for
situations in which a character faces a magical attack from an
unusual source.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This is used any
time a character is turned to stone (petrified) or polymorphed by a

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A character uses
this save when facing monsters with breath weapons, particularly the
powerful blast of a dragon. This save can also be used in situations
where a combination of physical stamina and Dexterity are critical
factors in survival.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Save
vs. Spell:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This is used
whenever a character attempts to resist the effects of a magical
attack, either by a spellcaster or from a magical item, provided no
other type of saving throw is specified. This save can also be used
to resist an attack that defies any other classification.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Voluntarily
Failing Saving Throws </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	No save is made if the target
voluntarily chooses not to resist the effect of a spell or special
attack. This is the case even if the character was duped as to the
exact nature of the spell. When a character announces that he is not
resisting the spell's power, that spell (or whatever) has its full
effect.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The intention not to resist
must be clearly stated or set up through trickery, however. If a
character is attacked by surprise or caught unawares, he is normally
allowed a saving throw. The DM can modify this saving throw, making
the chance of success worse, if the situation warrants it. Only in
extreme cases of trickery and deception should an unwitting character
be denied a saving throw.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Ability
Checks as Saving Throws </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a character attempts to
avoid danger through the use of one of his abilities, an ability
check can be used in lieu of a saving throw.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, Ragnar the thief
has broken into someone's home when he hears a grating noise from the
ceiling above him. He looks up to find a five-ton block of the
ceiling headed straight for him! He is going to need speedy reactions
to get out of the way, so a Dexterity ability check should be rolled
to see if he avoids the trap.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Modifying
Saving Throws </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Saving throws can be modified
by magical items, specific rules, and special situations. These
modifiers can increase or decrease the chance of a successful saving
throw.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Modifiers that increase the
chance are given as a number preceded by a plus sign. Modifiers that
make success more difficult are given as a number preceded by a minus
sign (-1, -2, etc.).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Saving throw modifiers affect
a character's die roll, not the saving throw number needed. Thus, if
Delsenora needed an 11 for a successful saving throw vs.
petrification and had a +1 bonus to her save, she would still need to
roll an 11 or higher after all adjustments were made (but the +1
bonus would be added to her die roll, so that effectively she needs
to roll only a 10 on the die to reach her saving throw number of 11).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>High
ability scores </b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">in
Dexterity and Wisdom sometimes give saving throw bonuses. A high
Wisdom protects against illusions, charms, and other mental attacks.
Dexterity, if high enough, can give a character a slightly higher
chance of avoiding the effects of fireballs, lightning bolts,
crushing boulders, and other attacks where nimbleness may be a help.
(See Tables 2 and 5.)</font></p>

physical, whether normal or magical; magical armor never gives a
saving throw bonus against gas (which it cannot block), poison (which
operates internally), and spells that are mental in nature or that
cause no physical damage.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, magical armor
would not help a character's saving throw against the sting of a
giant scorpion, the choking effects of a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>stinking

transformation effect of a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>polymorph

Magical armor does extend its protective power to saving throws
against acid sprays or splashes, disintegration, magical and normal
fires, spells that cause damage, and falls (if any saving throw is
allowed in this case). Other situations must be handled on a
case-by-case basis by the DM.</font></p>

both good and ill, on a character's saving throws. Often, spells
force the victim to save with a penalty, which makes even the most
innocuous spell quite dangerous. (Specific information can be found
in the spell descriptions, for spells, or in the DMG's Magical Items
section, for magical items.)</font></p>

penalty applied to those of his enemies. The powerful evil of the

<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Magic
Resistance </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Some creatures or items
strongly resist the effects of magic (or impart such resistance to
others). This makes them more difficult to affect with magical energy
than ordinary creatures or items.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A rare few creatures are
extremely anti-magical--magic rolls off them like water off a duck's
back. More common are creatures, especially from the Outer Planes of
existence, that live in enchanted or sorcerous lands and are filled
with powerful magical energies. These creatures eat and breathe the
vapors of wizardry, and they have a high tolerance against arcane
power.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Magic resistance is an innate
ability--that is, the possessor does not have to do anything special
to use it. The creature need not even be aware of the threat for his
magic resistance to operate. Such resistance is part of the creature
or item and cannot be separated from it. (Creatures, however, can
voluntarily lower their magic resistance at will.)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Magic resistance is also an
individual ability. A creature with magic resistance </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>cannot</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
impart this power to others by holding their hands or standing in
their midst. Only the rarest of creatures and magical items have the
ability to bestow magic resistance upon another.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Magic resistance is given as
a percentile number. For a magical effect to have any chance of
success, the magic resistance must be overcome. The target (the one
with the magic resistance) rolls percentile dice. If the roll is
higher than the creature's magic resistance, the spell has a normal
effect. If the roll is equal to or less than the creature's magic
resistance, the spell has absolutely no effect on the creature.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Effects
of Magic Resistance </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Magic resistance enables a
creature to ignore the effects of spells and spell-like powers. It
does not protect the creature from magical weapon attacks or from
natural forces that may be a direct or accidental result of a spell.
Nor does it prevent the protected creature from using his own
abilities or from casting spells and using magical items. It can be
effective against both individually targeted spells and, within
limits, area-effect spells.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a magic resistance roll
fails, and the spell has normal effect, the target can make all
saving throws normally allowed against the spell.</font></p>

<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">When
Magic Resistance Applies </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Magic resistance applies only
if the successful casting of a spell would directly affect the
resistant creature or item. Thus, magic resistance is effective
against </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>magic
missile</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> (targeted
at a creature or item) or </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>fireball</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
(damaging the area the creature or item is in) spells.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Magic resistance is not
effective against an earthquake caused by a spell. While the creature
may suffer injury or death falling into a chasm the spell opens under
its feet, the magical energy of the spell was directed at the ground,
not the creature. Magic resistant creatures are not immune to events
that occur as the consequence of spells, only to the direct energy
created or released by a spell.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Player characters do not
normally have magic resistance (though they still get saving throws
vs. magical spells and such); this ability is reserved mainly for

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Attempting to turn counts as
an action, requiring one round and occurring during the character's
turn in the initiative order (thus, the undead may get to act before
the character can turn them). The mere presence of the character is
not enough--a touch of drama from the character is important. Speech
and gestures are important, so the character must have his hands free
and be in a position to speak. However, turning is not like
spellcasting and is not interrupted if the character is attacked
during the attempt.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To resolve a turning attempt,
look on Table 61. Cross-index the Hit Dice or type of the undead with
the level of the character (two levels lower for a paladin). If there
is a number listed, roll 1d20. If the number rolled is equal to or
greater than that listed, the attempt is successful. If the letter
&quot;T&quot; (for &quot;turned&quot;) appears, the attempt is
automatically successful without a die roll. If the letter &quot;D&quot;
(for &quot;dispel&quot;) is given, the turning utterly destroys the
undead. A dash (--) means that a priest or paladin of that level
cannot turn that type of undead. </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>A
successful turn or dispel affects 2d6 undead. If the undead are a
mixed group, the lowest Hit Dice creatures are turned first.</i></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Only one die is rolled
regardless of the number of undead the character is attempting to
turn in a given round. The result is read individually for each type
of undead.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, Gorus, a
7th-level priest, and his party are attacked by two skeletons led by
a wight and a spectre. The turning attempt is made, resulting in a
roll of 12.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Gorus's player reads the
table for all three types of undead </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>using
the same roll--12--</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">for
all three. The skeletons are destroyed (as Gorus knew they would be).
The wight is turned (a 4 or better was needed) and flees. The
spectre, however, continues forward undaunted (since a 16 was needed
to turn the spectre).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Turned undead bound by the
orders of another (for example, skeletons) simply retreat and allow
the character and those with him to pass or complete their actions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Free-willed undead attempt to
flee the area of the turning character, until out of his sight. If
unable to escape, they circle at a distance, no closer than ten feet
to the character, provided he continues to maintain his turning (no
further die rolls are needed).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the character forces the
free-willed undead to come closer than ten feet (by pressing them
into a corner, for example) the turning is broken and the undead
attack normally.</font></p>

Priests and Undead </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Evil priests are normally
considered to be in league with undead creatures, or at least to
share their aims and goals. Thus, they have no ability to turn
undead. However, they can attempt to command these beings.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This is resolved in the same
way as a turning attempt. Up to 12 undead can be commanded. A &quot;T&quot;
result means the undead automatically obey the evil priest, while a
&quot;D&quot; means the undead become completely subservient to the
evil priest. They follow his commands (to the best of their ability
and understanding) until turned, commanded, or destroyed by another.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Evil priests also have the
ability to affect paladins, turning them as if they were undead.
However, since the living spirit of a paladin is far more difficult
to quell and subvert, paladins are vastly more difficult to turn.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	An evil priest attempting to
turn a paladin does so as if the priest were three levels lower than
he actually is. Thus, a 7th-level evil priest would turn paladins on
the 4th-level column. He would have only a slim chance of turning a
7th-level paladin (7 HD) and would not be able to turn one of 8th
level at all (using the level of the paladin as the HD to be turned).
All &quot;D&quot; results against paladins are treated as &quot;T&quot;
results.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To allow characters to be

</b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a character hits a
monster, or vice versa, damage is suffered by the victim. The amount
of damage depends on the weapon or method of attack. In Table 44 of
Chapter 6, all weapons are rated for the amount of damage they
inflict to Small, Medium, and Large targets. This is given as a die
range (1d8, 2d6, etc.).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Each time a hit is scored,
the appropriate dice are rolled and the damage is subtracted from the
current hit points of the target. An orc that attacks with a sword,
for example, causes damage according to the information given for the
type of sword it uses. A troll that bites once and rends with one of
its clawed hands causes 2d6 points of damage with its bite and 1d4 +
4 points with its claw. (The DM gets this information from the
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Monstrous&nbsp;Manual
</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">supplement.)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes damage is listed as
a die range along with a bonus of +1 or more. The troll's claw
attack, above, is a good example. This bonus may be due to high
Strength, magical weapons, or the sheer ferocity of the creature's
attack. The bonus is added to whatever number comes up on the die
roll, assuring that some minimum amount of damage is caused.
Likewise, penalties can also be applied, but no successful attack can
result in less than 1 point of damage.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes an attack has both
a die roll and a damage multiplier. The number rolled on the dice is
multiplied by the multiplier to determine how much damage is
inflicted. This occurs mainly in backstabbing attempts. In cases
where damage is multiplied, only the base damage caused by the weapon
is multiplied. Bonuses due to Strength or magic are not multiplied;
they are added after the rolled damage is multiplied.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Player characters have a
marvelous (and, to the DM, vastly amusing) tendency to fall off
things, generally from great heights and almost always onto hard
surfaces. While the falling is harmless, the abrupt stop at the end
tends to cause damage.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a character falls, he
suffers 1d6 points of damage for every 10 feet fallen, to a maximum
of 20d6 (which for game purposes can be considered terminal
velocity).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This method is simple and it
provides all the realism necessary in the game. It is not a
scientific calculation of the rate of acceleration, exact terminal
velocity, mass, impact energy, etc., of the falling body.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The fact of the matter is
that physical laws may describe the exact motion of a body as it
falls through space, but relatively little is known about the effects
of impact. The distance fallen is not the only determining factor in
how badly a person is hurt. Other factors may include elasticity of
the falling body and the ground, angle of impact, shock wave through
the falling body, dumb luck, and more.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	People have actually fallen
from great heights and survived, albeit very rarely. The current
record-holder, Vesna Vulovic, survived a fall from a height of 33,330
feet in 1972, although she was severely injured. Flight-Sergeant
Nicholas S. Alkemade actually fell 18,000 feet--almost 3.5

<p class="western" >

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a character is hit by an
energy-draining creature, he suffers normal damage from the attack.
In addition, the character loses one or more levels (and thus, Hit
Dice and hit points). For each level lost, roll the Hit Dice
appropriate to the character's class and subtract that number of hit
points from the character's total (subtract the Constitution bonus
also, if applicable). If the level(s) lost was one in which the
character received a set number of hit points rather than a die roll,
subtract the appropriate number of hit points. The adjusted hit point
total is now the character's maximum (i.e., hit points lost by energy
drain are not taken as damage but are lost permanently).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The character's experience
points drop to halfway between the minimum needed for his new

characters lose their highest level first. If both levels are equal,

first.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All powers and abilities
gained by the player character by virtue of his former level are
immediately lost, including spells. The character must instantly
forget any spells that are in excess of those allowed for his new
level. In addition, a wizard loses all understanding of spells in his
spell books that are of higher level than he can now cast. Upon
regaining his previous level, the spellcaster must make new rolls to
see if he can relearn a spell, regardless of whether he knew it
before.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

spell can be used to allow the character to resume his adventuring
career. If a 0-level character suffers another energy drain, he is
slain instantly, regardless of the number of hit points he has
remaining.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the character is drained
to less than 0 levels (thereby slain by the undead), he returns as an
undead of the same type as his slayer in 2d4 days. The newly risen
undead has the same character class abilities it had in normal life,
but with only half the experience it had at the beginning of its
encounter with the undead who slew it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The new undead is
automatically an NPC! His goals and ambitions are utterly opposed to
those he held before. He possesses great hatred and contempt for his
former colleagues, weaklings who failed him in his time of need.
Indeed, one of his main ambitions may be to destroy his former
companions or cause them as much grief as possible.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, the newly undead
NPC is under the total control of the undead who slew it. If this
master is slain, its undead minions gain one level for each level
they drain from victims until they reach the maximum Hit Dice for
their kind. Upon reaching full Hit Dice, these undead are able to
acquire their own minions (by slaying characters).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Appropriate actions on the
part of the other player characters can prevent a drained comrade
from becoming undead. The steps necessary vary with each type of

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This is an all-too frequent
hazard faced by player characters. Bites, stings, deadly potions,
drugged wines, and bad food all await characters at the hands of
malevolent wizards, evil assassins, hideous monsters, and incompetent
innkeepers. Spiders, snakes, centipedes, scorpions, wyverns, and
certain giant frogs all have poisons deadly to characters. Wise PCs
quickly learn to respect and fear such creatures.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The strength of different
poisons varies wildly and is frequently overestimated. The bite of
the greatly feared black widow spider kills a victim in the United
States only once every other year. Only about 2% of all rattlesnake
bites prove fatal.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the other extreme, there
are natural poisons of intense lethality. Fortunately, such poisons
tend to be exotic and rare--the golden arrow-poison frog, the western
taipan snake, and the stonefish all produce highly deadly poisons.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, the effect of a
poison depends on how it is delivered. Most frequently, it must be
injected into the bloodstream by bite or sting. Other poisons are
only effective if swallowed; assassins favor these for doctoring
food. By far the most deadly variety, however, is contact poison,
which need only touch the skin to be effective.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Paralytic poisons leave the
character unable to move for 2d6 hours. His body is limp, making it
difficult for others to move him. The character suffers no other ill
effects from the poison, but his condition can lead to quite a few
problems for his companions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Debilitating poisons weaken
the character for 1d3 days. All of the character's ability scores are
reduced by half during this time. All appropriate adjustments to
attack rolls, damage, Armor Class, etc., from the lowered ability
scores are applied during the course of the illness. Furthermore, the
character moves at one-half his normal movement rate. Finally, the
character cannot heal by normal or magical means until the poison is
neutralized or the duration of the debilitation is elapsed.</font></p>

Poison Victims</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Fortunately, there are many
ways a character can be treated for poison. Several spells exist that
either slow the onset time, enabling the character the chance to get
further treatment, or negate the poison entirely. However, cure
spells (including </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>heal</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">)
do not negate the progress of a poison, and </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>neutralize

</b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Once a character is wounded,
his player will naturally want to get him healed. Characters can heal
either by natural or magical means. Natural healing is slow, but it's
available to all characters, regardless of class. Magical healing may
or may not be available, depending on the presence (or absence) of
spellcasters or magical devices.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The only limit to the amount
of damage a character can recover through healing is the total hit
points the character has. A character cannot exceed this limit until
he gains a new level, whereupon another Hit Die (or a set number of
points) is added to his total. Healing can never restore more hit
points to a character than his maximum hit point total.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Natural
Healing </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Characters heal naturally at
a rate of 1 hit point per day of rest. Rest is defined as low
activity--nothing more strenuous than riding a horse or traveling
from one place to another. Fighting, running in fear, lifting a heavy
boulder, or any other physical activity prevents resting, since it
strains old wounds and may even reopen them.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a character has complete
bed rest (doing nothing for an entire day), he can regain 3 hit
points for the day. For each complete week of bed rest, the character
can add any Constitution hit point bonus he might have to the base of
21 points (3 points per day) he regained during that week.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In both cases above, the
character is assumed to be getting adequate food, water, and sleep.
If these are lacking, the character does not regain any hit points
that day.</font></p>

Healing </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Healing spells, potions, and
magical devices can speed the process of healing considerably. The
specifics of such magical healing methods are described in the spell
descriptions in this book and in the DMG (for magical items). By
using these methods, wounds close instantly and vigor is restored.
The effects are immediate.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Magical healing is
particularly useful in the midst of combat or in preparation for a
grievous encounter. Remember, however, that the characters' opponents
are just as likely to have access to magical healing as the player
characters--an evil high priest is likely to carry healing spells to
bestow on his own followers and guards. Healing is not, of itself, a
good or evil act.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Remember that under no
circumstances can a character be healed to a point greater than his
original hit point total. For example, say a character has 30 hit
points, but suffers 2 points of damage in a fight. A while later, he
takes an additional point of damage, bringing his current hit point
total to 27. A spellcaster couldn't restore more than 3 points to
him, regardless of the healing method used. Any excess points are
lost.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Poison complicates this
situation, somewhat. A character who dies as a result of poisoning
may still have active venom in his system.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Poisons remain effective for
2d6 hours after the death of the victim. If the character is raised
during this time, some method must be found to neutralize the poison
before the character is restored to life. If this is not done, then
after the character rolls the resurrection survival check as given in
&quot;Raising the Dead&quot; later in this chapter (and assuming the
roll is successful), he must immediately roll a successful saving
throw vs. poison or suffer all the effects of the poison in his body,
as per the normal rules. This may only injure some characters, but it
may kill other characters seconds after being raised!</font></p>

From Massive Damage </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition to dying when hit
points reach 0, a character also runs the risk of dying abruptly when
he suffers massive amounts of damage. A character who suffers 50 or
more points of damage from a single attack must roll a successful
saving throw vs. death, or he dies.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This applies only if the
damage was done by a single attack. Multiple attacks totaling 50
points in a single round don't require a saving throw.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, a character
would be required to make a check if a dragon breathed on him for 72
points of damage. He wouldn't have to do so if eight orcs hit him for
a total of 53 points of damage in that round.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the saving throw is
successful, the character remains alive (unless of course the
50-hit-point loss reduced his hit points to 0 or below!). If the
saving throw fails, the character immediately dies from the intense
shock his body has taken. His hit points are reduced to 0.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

a character is returned to life, the player must make a resurrection
survival roll based on his current Constitution (see Table 3). If the

his resurrection survival percentage), the character is restored to

<p class="western" >

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Hidden out there in the
campaign world are great treasures awaiting discovery. Ancient
dragons rest on huge hordes of gold, silver, and gems. Orc chieftains
greedily garner the loot from the latest raid. Mindless jellies ooze
through the bones and armor of unfortunate souls. Foul lords of
darkness cunningly leave small fortunes apparently unguarded, like
spiders luring in the flies. Stooped wizards assemble shelves of
arcane magical items. Some treasures, like those of dragons, are
gathered and horded for reasons fully understood only by their
collectors. Others are gathered for more mundane purposes--power,
luxury, and security. A rare few troves date from eons before, their
owners long dead and forgotten. Some treasure hordes are small, such
as the pickings of a yellow mold. Others are enormous, such as the
Tyrant King's treasury. Treasures may be free for the taking or
fiercely trapped and watched over.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Treasure
Types </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Treasure comes in many
different forms and sizes, ranging from the mundane to the exotic.
There are of course coins of copper, silver, gold, electrum, and
platinum. But precious metals can also be shaped into gilded cups,
etched bowls, or even silverware. Characters know the value of coins
and will have no difficulty establishing their worth in most cases.
However, ancient treasure hordes may contain coins no longer used. It
may be that these can be sold only by their weight. Objects made of
valuable metal are even more difficult to appraise. Either the
characters must find a goldsmith who can value the item and a buyer
willing to pay a fair price, or these too must be melted down for
their metal. In large cities this is not too difficult. There are
always appraisers and fences handy, although getting full value might
be difficult. (Accusations of theft are another small problem.)
Characters must be aware of cheats and counterfeiters though. An
apparently valuable bowl could actually be base metal plated in
silver. The metal of coins could be debased with copper or brass.
Weights could be rigged to give false prices. Characters must find
merchants they can trust.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Gems are another common form
of treasure and here player characters are even more dependent on
others. Unless the party has a skilled appraiser of precious stones,
they're going to have to trust others. After all, those red stones
they found in the last treasure could be cheap glass, richly colored
but only marginally valuable quartz, semi-precious garnets, or
valuable rubies. Again, the player characters are going to have to
find a jeweler they can trust and be watchful for cheats and scams.
However, truly tricky DMs might present your characters with uncut
gems. These are almost impossible for the untrained eye to spot or
appraise. Most characters (and most players) are not going to realize
that a piece of unremarkable stone can be a valuable gem when
properly cut.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Perhaps the most difficult of
all treasure items to appraise are objects of artistic value. While
gems cut or uncut are valuable, their worth can be greatly increased
when used in a piece of jewelry. Gold is valuable by weight, but even
more so when fashioned into a cup or pin. Dwarven craftsmen from
hidden communities practice the finest arts of gem cutting, while
gnomish artisans in earthen burrows labor away on elaborate gold and
silver filigrees. Ancient elven carvings, done in exquisitely grained
woods, stand side by side with the purest of statues chiseled by man.
All of these have a value that goes far beyond their mere materials.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But artistic creations seldom
have a fixed value. Their price depends on the player characters
finding a buyer and that person's willingness to buy. A few large
cities may have brokers in arts, merchants who know the right people
and are willing to act as go-betweens. Most of the time, however, the
player characters have to go to the effort of peddling their wares
personally. This requires tact and delicacy, for such items are
seldom bought by any but the wealthy and the wealthy often do not
like stooping to business negotiations. Player characters must
carefully avoid giving insult to the barons, dukes, counts, and
princes they might deal with.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, there are the truly
unusual things your character can find--furs, exotic animals, spices,
rare spell components, or even trade goods. As with art objects, the
values of these items are highly subjective. First the player
characters have to find a buyer. This is not too difficult for
everyday things, such as furs or trade goods, but it can be a
tremendous enterprise if you have a spell component that is useful
only to the most powerful of wizards. Next the PCs must haggle about
the price. Furriers and merchants do this as a matter of course.
Others haggle because they hope the PCs do not know the true value of
what they hold or because they themselves do not know. After all
this, the PCs might be able to sell their goods. However, if you
enter into this in the true spirit of role-playing and see it as part
of the adventure, the whole process is enjoyable.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Magical
Items </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The treasures mentioned thus
far are all monetary. Their usefulness is immediate and obvious. They
give characters wealth, and with wealth comes power and influence.
However, there are other treasures, very desirable ones, that your
characters will not want to sell or give away. These are the magical
items that your characters find and use.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although priests and wizards
can make magical items (according to the guidelines your DM has for
magical research), it is far more common for characters to find these
items during the course of adventures. Magical items are powerful
aids for characters. With them, characters can gain bonuses in
combat, cast spells with the mere utterance of a word, withstand the
fiercest fire, and perform feats impossible by any other known means.
Not all magical items are beneficial, however. Some are cursed, the
result of faulty magical construction or, very rarely, the deliberate
handiwork of some truly mad or evil wizard.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A very few magical items are
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>artifacts</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">--items
created by beings more powerful than the greatest player characters.
These are perilously dangerous items to use. There are only three
methods to determine how to use artifacts--dumb luck, trial and
error, and diligent research.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are many different
magical items your character can find, but they all fall into a few
basic categories. Each type of magical item has properties you should
be aware of.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Magical
Weapons:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">There can be a
magical version of nearly any type of normal weapon, although there
are admittedly few magical bardiches or guisarme-voulges. By far the
most common magical weapons are swords and daggers. A magical weapon
typically gives a +1 or greater bonus to attack rolls, increasing a
character's chance to hit and cause damage. Perhaps magical swords
are quicker on the attack, or maybe they're sharper than normal
steel--the explanation can be whatever the DM desires. Whatever the
reason, magical weapons give results far beyond those of even the
finest-crafted nonmagical blade.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A rare few weapons have even
greater powers. These may allow your character to sense danger, heal
wounds, float in midair, or have the most amazing luck. The rarest of
the rare can actually communicate with your character and are imbued
with an otherworldly intelligence. While the most powerful of magical
weapons, these clever instruments of destruction sometimes seek to
impose their wills on their owners.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When you find a magical
weapon, more than likely you do not know its properties. Some
functions, such as the advantage it gives you in combat, can be
learned by trial and error. Other properties must be learned through
research and spells. Ancient histories and </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>legend
lore</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spells can
provide information on the properties of your weapon. On rare
occasions, properties are discovered through blind luck. Simply
commanding the weapon to activate one power after another (hoping it
will suddenly spring to life) works only for the most minor
abilities--detecting danger, spotting secret doors, or locating
treasure. Greater abilities require that specific commands be
uttered, perhaps in long-forgotten languages.</font></p>

are the complements to magical weapons. These armors have a +1 or
better bonus to their normal Armor Class, being made of stuff
stronger and finer than nonmagical armor. Furthermore, these armors
grant some measure of protection against attacks that normal armors
would not stop. </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Chain

and oils are easily found but hard to identify. They come in small
bottles, jugs, pots, or vials and clearly radiate magic if a
detection spell is used. However, the effect of any potion is unknown
until some brave soul tries a small sample. The results can be quite
varied. The imbiber may discover he can float or fly, resist great
heat or cold, heal grievous wounds, or fearlessly face the greatest
dangers. He may also find himself hopelessly smitten by the first
creature he sees or struck dead by a powerful poison. It is a risk
that must be taken to learn the nature of the potion.</font></p>

Experienced and powerful wizards normally spend their evenings
preparing such scrolls for their own adventuring use.</font></p>

all characters, granting special but temporary protections from
various dangers--evil creatures, werewolves, powerful beings from
other planes, etc. Other scrolls bear hideous or humorous curses,
brought into effect at the mere reading of their titles.
Unfortunately, the only way to know what a scroll contains is to
silently scan its contents. For scrolls containing wizard spells,
this requires the use of a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>read

scrolls can be read by all. This scan does not cast the spell written
on the scroll, but it tells the character what is written there (and
exposes him to the effects of curses). Once the scroll is read, it
can be used at any time in the future by that character.</font></p>

by wizards, allowing them to cast powerful spells with the flick of a
wrist. Staves can be used by either a wizard or a priest. Staves can
be truly destructive, dwarfing even the potential of a wand. Rods are
the rarest of all, the accouterments of witch-kings and great lords.
With rods come dominance and power.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Fortunately for your
character, few of these items are cursed or dangerous to handle. But
all must be operated by a command word--a specific word or phrase
that triggers the power within. No wand, stave, or rod shows any
indication of its powers by mere sight or handling. Careful research
and probing are most often needed to tap the potential stored within.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Wands, staves, and rods are
not limitless in their power. Each use drains them slightly, using up
a charge. There is no power gauge or meter showing what is left. A
character discovers his wand is drained only when it no longer
functions or suddenly crumbles into useless dust.</font></p>

magical items are where the true variety of magical treasures lies.
Each item possesses some unique power. There are horseshoes to make
your horse go faster, brooms to ride, sacks that hold more than they
should, paints that create real things, girdles that grant great
strength, caps to make your character smarter, books that increase
ability scores, and much, much more. Each item is different and not
all can be identified in the same way. The effects of some become
obvious the instant the item is handled, donned, or opened. Others
require research and questioning to learn the command word needed to
activate them. All are quite valuable and rare.</font></p>

and Relics:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Finally, there
are artifacts and relics. Don't count on your PC ever finding one of
these rarest of all magical items. Even if your character does find
one, think carefully before you decide to let him keep it
permanently. Artifacts are the most powerful magical items in the
game. Indeed, many are powerful enough to alter the course of
history! They are all unique and have unique histories. You can never
find more than one </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Hand
of Vecna</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> in a
world. Because it is so unique, each artifact has special and
significant powers. Artifacts never appear by accident; they are
always placed by the DM.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finding artifacts is always
the result of a very special adventure. Your DM has placed that
artifact for a reason. It is not likely that he really intends for
your characters to keep it. Instead, he has something arranged in
which you need that artifact for a specific purpose. The problem with
keeping artifacts is that they are too powerful. Not only do they
unbalance your character in the short run, they also eventually
corrupt and destroy him. The magical power of artifacts is such that
they destroy their owners sooner or later. There is a price to be
paid for power, and it is not a cheap one.</font></p>

<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Dividing
and Storing Treasure </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once your group completes a
successful adventure, it is almost certain to have collected some
treasure. Therefore, it helps to have some prearranged agreement
about how this treasure is to be divided among the different player
characters and their henchmen. This is a true role-playing decision
that must be reached among all the players at the table. There are no
rules about how your characters should divide treasures.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, there are some
suggested methods and reasons to make or not make some agreements. If
you bear these in mind, you will have fewer arguments and bad
feelings between the different players and their characters in your
group.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Cash treasure is the easiest.
The most direct and simplest method is equal shares for all player
characters and full or half shares for all henchmen. A player may
argue that his character's contribution was greater than that of
other characters, but these things average out in the long run.
Besides, that player has no real idea of the contribution of others.
A character who guarded the rear may have discouraged hidden
opponents from springing an ambush on the group, something that only
the DM knows.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Additional considerations
include extraordinary costs. Some adventuring groups establish a
special fund to pay the costs (if there are any) of healing,
resurrecting, or restoring fellow player characters. Again this works
on the principle that all faced the danger and therefore all should
share equally in the expenses. Other groups make allowances for
differing character levels (higher level characters assumedly
shouldered more of the burden of the adventure, and so should be
rewarded proportionately.) Some parties give special rewards to those
who took greater chances or saved others. These encourage everyone in
the group to take part.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Magical treasure is more
difficult to divide up, since there is rarely enough to give a useful
item to every character, nor are all items of equal value or power.
Here you must rely more on your sense of fairness if you wish to
maintain party harmony. Since magical items are worthwhile to a party
only if they can be used, your first concern should normally be to
get the right item into the right hands. A magical sword in the
possession of a wizard is not nearly as useful as it would be in the
hands of a fighter. Likewise, a wand does a fighter little good but
could be a potent addition to a wizard. Therefore it is a good idea
to match items to characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Alternatively, your party
could determine the price an item would sell for, and then make it
available to any PC who is willing to give the rest of the party that
amount of money. If more than one player is willing to pay the price,
the interested players could roll dice to see who gets the item. Or,
for items that several characters could all use equally well (such as
a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>potion of healing</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
that is useful to all), the characters can bargain with each other
and roll dice for choices. A player character may relinquish a claim
on one magical item in exchange for another. A character who has
already received a magical item may not be allowed another choice if
there are not enough pieces to go around. If no other agreement can
be reached, the players can roll dice and have their characters pick
in descending order. It is a fair method (since people cannot
rightfully complain about a random roll), but it can create
imbalances. One or two characters could wind up with the bulk of the
magical items over the course of several adventures. At this point,
they would be wise to voluntarily withdraw from the selection
process.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are tactical issues to
think about when distributing treasure. It is simply not wise for one
or two characters to carry the bulk of the party's magical items.
Successful adventurers spread their gear throughout their party.
(This holds true even for explorers and special forces in the real
world.) This way, if one character falls off the cliff and disappears
forever or is spirited away by an invisible stalker, the party has
not lost everything. To illustrate another consideration, you are
better off to have the fighters, thieves, and mages carry the healing
potions rather than let the cleric do it, since he has healing
spells. If he has both the healing spells and the potions and should
disappear into the mist, your party has lost all its healing ability.
If it is spread around through the group, at worst you might lose the
potions or the spells, but not both (unless disaster really strikes,
in which case there is no way to prevent it anyway). In the end, you
will find that it does not pay to be too greedy.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once your characters have
assembled a sizeable amount of treasure, they have to find some place
to keep it. If your DM is running a fairly medieval campaign, one
thing PCs are not going to find is a bank like today's. Instead, your
characters must find other ways to keep their money secure. Chests
with strong locks are a good start, but there are still better
methods. One choice is to make the treasure small enough that you can
carry it with you at all times. (Of course, one good mugging and
you're broke.) There is also the difficulty of buying a drink with a
1,000-gp gem. A second choice is to place your money in the hands of
someone you think you can trust. We all know what the risks are
there. You could have your character give his fortune to a local lord
or church and then hope to call in favors at a future date. This is
not quite as foolish as it sounds. If the beneficiary of your largess
refuses to honor your agreement, you'll never give him money again
and neither will anyone else, most likely. If no one gives him any
money, where will he find the funds to support his lifestyle? No,
such a person must seriously try to honor his commitments. Of course,
he may not do as much as you would like. The best solution is that
used throughout history--buy goods and chattels. Land, livestock, and
trade goods are harder to steal and harder to lose. If you must keep
a large fortune, it is best to keep it in something that can be
carried easily and is unlikely to be stolen.</font></p>

</b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Whenever a player character
meets an NPC (nonplayer character), fights a monster, or even
discovers a mysterious fountain in the woods, he is having an
encounter. An encounter is any significant thing a character meets,
sees, or interacts with during the course of a game. When a player
character discovers a fountain of blue flame in the midst of the
forest, its very strangeness forces the character to react and the
player to think. Why is it here? Does it have a purpose? Is it
beneficial or dangerous? Few characters are going to pass this by as
just another flaming fountain in the forest.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Encounters are vital to the
AD&amp;D game, for without them nothing can really happen to the
player character. An adventure without encounters is like sitting in
a room all day with no one to talk to and little to look at. It
certainly wouldn't be very exciting. And who wants to play an
unexciting role-playing game? Encounters provide danger, risk,
mystery, information, intrigue, suspense, humor, and more.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For an encounter to provide
excitement, it must also have an element of danger. A good deal of
this comes from the fact that player characters don't know how the
encountered beings will react to them. Your DM is not going to say,
&quot;You meet a group of peasants and they are friendly.&quot; (If
he </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>does</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
say this, you ought to be suspicious.) Instead, he will say something
like, &quot;As you ride around the bend, you come upon an oxcart
lumbering down the road. A young man in rough clothes is leading the
cart. Peering over the sides are a woman and several dirty children.
When the man sees you he nods, smiles, and says, &quot;Hail,
strangers. Have you news of Thornhampton-on-the-Hill?&quot; You can
probably guess they are peasants and they seem friendly, but your DM
didn't come out and say so. Not knowing for sure is what keeps you on
your toes. They could be anything!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When your character travels
or explores a dungeon, your DM will have prepared two general types
of encounters. The first are </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>specific</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
(planned) </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>encounters</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
These are meetings, events, or things the DM has chosen to place in
the adventure to build on the story of the adventure.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, upon sneaking
into the bugbear stronghold, your characters find a squalid cell
filled with humans and elves. Your DM has placed them here for your
character to rescue. Of course, he could also be playing a trick and
the prisoners could actually be evil dopplegangers (creatures able to
change their appearances at will).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Later, while in the hallway,
your group bumps into a bugbear patrol. This is the second type of
encounter, a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>random
encounter</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">, also
called a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>wandering
encounter</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">. In this
case, your DM has made die rolls to see if you come upon something
and, if so, just what that something is.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Specific encounters generally
have more choices of action--your DM may want you to discover some
important information or set up a particularly difficult battle.
Specific encounters usually yield greater treasures and more magical
items. Creatures may be placed by the DM to guard the armory or
prevent the characters from reaching the throne room.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Random encounters normally
involve simple choices--run away, fight, or ignore. Sometimes
characters can talk to creatures in random encounters and learn
valuable information, but not often. Random encounters also tend to
have little or no treasure. A patrol of city guardsmen does not carry
as many valuable items on its rounds as it would have in its
barracks. Random encounters are most often used to weaken PCs, raise
an unexpected alarm, hurry them along, or just make their lives
difficult.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes encounters are not
with people or monsters but with things. The fountain in the forest
is an encounter, but your characters cannot fight it or talk to it
(well, maybe not). So what are you supposed to do? In these cases,
the encounter is more of a puzzle. You have to figure out why this
fountain is here, what it can do, and if it is important to your
adventure. It may be a red herring--something placed there just to
confuse you; it may be a set up for a future adventure--later on your
characters may learn that the flaming fountain they saw is important
to their latest mission. It may be a deadly trap. To find out,
though, you will have to deal with the thing in some way. You could
throw stones into the pool, drink the glowing water, try to walk
through the flames, or use spells to learn more. By doing these
things, you may get more information from your DM. Of course, you may
not like the answer! (&quot;You drank the water? Oh, dear. Tsk, tsk,
tsk.&quot;)</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>The
Surprise Roll </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>	</b></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Sometimes
an encounter, either random or planned by the DM, catches one of the
two groups involved totally off guard. This is called </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>surprise</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
and is determined by rolling 1d10 for each side (or only one side if
the DM has decided that one of the sides cannot be surprised, for
some reason). If the die roll is a 1, 2, or 3, that group or
character is surprised (for effects, see the &quot;Effects of
Surprise&quot; section). Naturally, surprise does not happen all the
time. There are many easy and intelligent ways it can be prevented.
The most obvious is if the player characters can see those they are
about to encounter well before getting close.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, the characters
may see the dust of a group of horsemen coming their way, or notice
the lanterns of a group of peasants coming through the woods, or hear
the grunting barks of a gnoll war party closing through the trees. In
these cases there is no way the characters are going to be surprised
by the encounter. But if a leopard leaped upon one of the group while
he was intently watching the approaching riders, or if a group of
goblins suddenly sprang from the darkness, then the characters would
have to roll to see if they were surprised. They were unprepared for
these threats and so could be taken off guard.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM decides when a check
for surprise must be made. He can require that one roll be made for
the entire party, that a separate check be made for each character,
or that only specific characters check. This depends entirely upon
the situation.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, the entire party
is intently watching the band of approaching riders. Then a leopard
leaps from the branches of a tree overhead. The DM knows that no one
in the group was particularly paying attention to the treetops, so he
has one person in the group roll the surprise die for the entire
party. The roll is a 2, the PCs are surprised, the leopard gets a
free round of attacks, and there is mass confusion as the clawing,
biting creature lands in their midst! If two of the characters had
been on a general watch, the DM could have had these characters roll
for surprise instead of the entire group. If both were surprised, the
entire group would have been unprepared for the leopard's attack.
Otherwise, one or both of the guards might have noticed the creature
before it pounced. Experienced player characters quickly learn the
value of having someone on watch at all times.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The surprise roll can also be
modified by Dexterity, race, class, cleverness, and situation. The DM
has the listing of modifiers that apply to given situations.
Modifiers can affect either your character's chance of being
surprised or his chance of surprising others. A plus to your die roll
reduces the odds that you are surprised; a minus increases those
odds. Likewise, a minus to the enemy's die roll means that the
modifier is in your favor, while a plus means that things are going
his way. High Dexterity characters are virtually unsurpriseable,
caught off guard only in unusual situations.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It is important to bear in
mind that surprise and ambush are two different things. Surprise
works as explained above. An ambush is prepared by one group to make
an unexpected attack on another group and works only if the DM
decides the other group cannot detect the ambush. A properly set
ambush gives the attackers the opportunity to use spells and normal
attacks before the other side reacts. If the ambush succeeds, the
ambushing group gets its initial attack </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>and</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
the other group must roll for surprise in the next round, so the
ambushing group may get two rounds of attacks before the other group
can reply.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Effects
of Surprise </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Characters and monsters that
are surprised all suffer the same penalty. They are caught off guard
and thus cannot react quickly. The surprising group receives one
round of attacks with melee, missile, or magical items. They cannot
use these moments of surprise to cast spells.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A ranger on the unsurprised
side could fire his long bow twice (two attacks per round) before his
opponents could even hope to react. A fighter able to attack twice
per round could attempt both hits before any initiative dice are
rolled. A wizard could unleash a bolt from his </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>wand
of lightning</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> before
the enemy knew he was there. Of course, what applies to player
characters also applies to monsters, so that the leopard in the
earlier example could claw and bite before the characters even knew
what was happening.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The second effect of surprise
is that the surprised characters lose all AC bonuses for high
Dexterity during that instant of surprise. The surprised characters
are dumbfounded by the attack. Instead of ducking and countering,
they're just standing there rather flat-footed (maybe even with dumb
expressions on their faces). Since they don't grasp the situation,
they cannot avoid the hazards and dangers very well.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Surprise can also be used to
avoid an encounter. Unsurprised characters can attempt to flee from a
surprised group before the other group reacts. Of course, this is not
always successful, since escape is greatly dependent upon the
movement rates of the different creatures.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If both groups manage to
surprise each other, the effects of surprise are cancelled. For
example, Rath runs around the corner straight into some lounging
guardsmen. Taken by surprise, he stops suddenly and frantically looks
for someplace else to run. The guardsmen in turn look up rather
stupidly, trying to figure out why this dwarf just raced around the
corner. The surprise passes. Rath spots another alley and the guards
decide that since he's running, Rath must be a criminal. Initiative
rolls are now made to see who acts first.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Encounter
Distance </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once your character or party
has an encounter and it has been determined whether or not anyone was
surprised, your DM will tell you the range of the encounter--the
distance separating you from the other group. Many factors affect
encounter distance. These include the openness of the terrain, the
weather conditions, whether surprise occurred, and the time of day,
to name a few. Although you do not know the exact distance until your
DM tells you, surprise, darkness, or close terrain (woods, city
streets, or narrow dungeons) usually results in shorter encounter
distances, while open ground (deserts, plains, or moors), good light,
or advance warning results in greater encounter distances (see
Chapter 13: Vision and Light).</font></p>

Options </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once an encounter occurs,
there is no set sequence for what happens next. It all depends on
just what your characters have encountered and what they choose to
do. That's the excitement of a role-playing game--once you meet
something, almost anything could happen. There are some fairly common
results of encounters, however.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Evasion:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Sometimes all
you want is for your characters to avoid, escape, or otherwise get
away from whatever it is you've met. Usually this is because you
realize your group is seriously outmatched. Perhaps returning badly
hurt from an adventure, your group spots a red dragon soaring
overhead. You know it can turn your party to toast if it wants.
Rather than take that risk, your group hides, waiting for it to pass.
Or, topping a ridge, you see the army of Frazznargth the Impious, a
noted warlord. There are 5,000 of them and six of you. Retreat seems
like the better part of valor, so you turn your horses and ride.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes you want to avoid
an encounter simply because it will take too much time. While riding
with an urgent message for his lord, your character rides into a
group of wandering pilgrims. Paying them no mind, he lashes his horse
and gallops past.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Evading or avoiding an
encounter is not always successful. Some monsters pursue; others do
not. In the examples above, Frazznargth the Impious (being a prudent
commander) orders a mounted patrol to chase the characters and bring
them in for questioning. The pilgrims, on the other hand, shout a few
oaths as your galloping horse splashes mud on them and then continue
on their way. Your character's success at evading capture will depend
on movement rates, determination of pursuit, terrain, and just a
little luck. Sometimes when he really should be caught, your
character gets lucky. At other times, well, he just has to stand his
ground.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Talk:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Your character
doesn't run from encounters all the time, and attacking everything
you meet eventually leads to problems. Sometimes the best thing to do
is talk, whether it's casual conversation, hardball negotiation,
jovial rumor-swapping, or intimidating threats. In fact, talking is
often better than fighting. To solve the problems your DM has created
for your character, you need information. Asking the right questions,
developing contacts, and putting out the word are all useful ways to
use an encounter. Not everything you meet, human or otherwise, is out
to kill your character. Help often appears in the most surprising
forms. Thus it often pays to take the time to talk to creatures.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Fight:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Of course, there
are times when you don't want to or can't run away. (Running all the
time is not that heroic.) And there are times when you know talking
is not a good idea. Sooner or later, your character will have to
fight. The real trick is knowing when to fight and when to talk or
run. If you attack every creature you meet, the first thing that will
happen is that nobody will want to meet with your character. Your
character will also manage to kill or chase off everyone who might
want to help him. Finally, sooner or later your DM is going to get
tired of this and send an incredibly powerful group of monsters after
your character. Given the fact that you've been killing everything in
sight, he's justified in doing this.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So it is important always to
know who you are attacking and why. As with the best police in the
world today, the trick is to figure out who are the bad guys and who
are the good guys. Make mistakes and you pay. You may kill an NPC who
has a vital clue, or unintentionally anger a baron far more powerful
than yourself. NPCs will be reluctant to associate with your
character, and the law will find fewer and fewer reasons to protect
him. It is always best to look on combat as a last resort.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Sometimes when
you encounter another group, you don't know what you should do. You
don't want to attack them in case they are friendly, but you don't
want to say anything to provoke them. What you can do is wait and see
how they react. Waiting is a perfectly sensible option. However,
there is the risk that in waiting, you lose the advantage should the
other side suddenly decide to attack. Waiting for a reaction so that
you can decide what to do causes a +1 penalty to the first initiative
roll for your group, if the other side attacks.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of course, in any given
encounter, there may be many other options open to your character.
The only limit is your imagination (and common sense). Charging a
band of orcs to break through their lines and flee may work. Talking
them down with an elaborate bluff about the army coming up behind you
might scare them off. Clever use of spells could end the encounter in
sudden and unexpected ways. The point is, this is a role-playing game
and the options are as varied as you wish to make them.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Player characters cannot
fight, survive, wheel, deal, plot, or scheme without interacting with
nonplayer characters (NPCs). Indeed, the very heart of the AD&amp;D
game is the relationship between player characters and nonplayer
characters. How the player characters react to and treat NPCs
determines the type of game the group plays. Although many choices
are possible, players quickly find that consideration and good
treatment of NPCs is the most frequently successful route.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

NPC is any person, creature, or monster that is controlled by the DM</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
Most NPCs are either people (intelligent races that live in local
society) or monsters (intelligent and unintelligent creatures that
aren't normally found in towns and villages). The term &quot;monster&quot;
is only a convenient label. It doesn't mean the creature is
automatically dangerous or hostile. Likewise, NPCs who are people
aren't uniformly helpful and cooperative. As with all things, the
range of possible reactions of NPCs to PCs covers the entire
spectrum.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In the course of their
adventures, player characters will be most concerned with three
groups of NPCs: hirelings, followers, and henchmen. It is their aid
that helps player characters vanquish deadly monsters and accomplish
mighty deeds. As their names imply, these NPCs can be persuaded in
various ways to join the player characters in their adventures. The
most common methods of persuasion are money and loyalty.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The most frequently employed
NPC is the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>hireling</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
A hireling is a person who works for money. Most hirelings have
fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art,
and a few are experts of specialized adventuring skills. Typical
hirelings include the following:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Archer	Architect</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Armorer	Assassin</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Baker	Blacksmith</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Bladesmith	Foot Soldier</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Jeweler	Laborer</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Messenger	Minstrel</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Sage	Sailor</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Spy			Thief</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hirelings are always employed
for a stated term of service or for the performance of a specific
task. Thus, a mercenary contracts to serve for one season. A thief
can be hired to steal a named item. A sage works to answer a single
question. A blacksmith may indenture himself for a term of years. A
sailor works for a single voyage. Quite often these contracts can be
renewed without difficulty, but the only thing that binds a hireling
to the player character is regular pay and good treatment. Hirelings
do not serve a PC out of any great loyalty.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thus there are some things
hirelings will not do. Most hirelings do not foolishly risk their
lives. There are soldiers willing to take their chances on the field
of battle, but even these courageous (or foolish) few do not
willingly undertake the greater hazards of adventuring. They man
castle walls, guard caravans, collect taxes, and charge the massed
foe well enough, but they often refuse to accompany a PC on an
adventure. Even a hireling who regularly undertakes dangerous
missions (a thief or an assassin, for example) normally refuses to
join player character parties. These hirelings are loners. They
contract to do a job and get it done in their own way, without
interference from anyone else.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hirelings are no more loyal
than human nature allows. For the most part, if paid and treated
well, with opportunities to realize their ambitions, working for a
charismatic leader, hirelings can be relied on to do their jobs
faithfully. But poor pay, injustice, discrimination, threats, abuse,
and humiliation at the hands of their masters make them somewhat less
than reliable. A smart leader sees to the comfort and morale of his
men before his own concerns. With less savory characters--those hired
to perform dark deeds--the player character takes even greater
chances, especially given the questionable morals of such characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Whatever their personalities,
hirelings generally need to make morale checks (explained in the DMG)
whenever they are faced with a particularly dangerous situation or
are offered a bribe or other temptation.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finding hirelings is not
difficult. People need jobs. It is simply a matter of advertising.
Under normal circumstances, applicants respond to ads. Only when
trying to employ vast numbers or hire those with unusual specialties
(such as spies) does the process become complicated. Just what needs
to be done in this situation depends entirely upon the DM's campaign.
Your character may have to skulk through the unsavory bars of the
waterfront, rely on questionable go-betweens, or pay a visit to the
thieves' guild (if there is one). Just employing one of these
characters can be a small adventure in itself.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Employment costs of hirelings
vary from a few gold pieces a month to thousands of gold pieces for
an especially dangerous task. The skill and experience of a hireling
has a great effect on his salary. A learned sage researching some
obscure piece of lore can charge hefty sums. Costs can also be
affected by the conditions of the campaign--the setting, the recent
events of the world, and the reputations of the player characters (if
any). Most hirelings sign on for what they think is fair. While few
will turn down more money, most will drive the best bargain they can.
Your DM has more information about employment costs, since he may
need to alter these to fit his campaign.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Followers
</b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	More reliable than those who
are motivated purely by money are those characters who, while they
expect pay, were originally drawn into service by the reputation of
the player character. These are </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>followers</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
usually a unit of soldiers of one type or another. Followers serve
only those of significant power and reputation, thus the construction
of a stronghold is necessary to attract followers.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Followers have the same needs
and limitations of hirelings. Most must be paid and well-treated.
They also do not accompany the player characters on group adventures.
They have some advantages over hirelings, however. Followers do not
serve for a specific term of contract. They remain with the player
character as long as their basic needs are met. They are more loyal
than the average hireling and are treated as elite troops. Unlike
most hirelings, followers can increase in level (although this occurs
very slowly since they act only as soldiers). All followers in a unit
advance to the next level at the same time. Finally, the player
character need not seek out followers--they come to him, seeking out
positions within his illustrious household.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Followers appear only once.
Replacements do not arrive to fill the ranks of the fallen. (Massive
losses of followers in combat only gives the character a bad
reputation, discouraging others from flocking to his banner.) Player
characters should take care of their followers, perhaps treating them
as an elite bodyguard.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some characters attract
unique followers such as animals or magical beings. Although termed
followers, these creatures are more properly treated as henchmen in
terms of loyalty and what they will and will not do. They do not
count against the character's limit on henchmen, however, since they
are technically followers.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Henchmen
</b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Henchmen are much that
hirelings are not. They are adventurers who serve out of loyalty.
They are willing to risk their lives for those they respect. They are
also hard to find.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Henchmen are powerful allies
to a player character. Unlike hirelings, they have the nerve and
ability to become powerful adventurers. Although they expect their
share of treasure, they do not usually join a player character for
money. They are attracted to the PC because of his reputation or
other qualities he possesses. As such, henchmen cannot be expected to
flock to the banner of a neophyte adventurer. He may gain himself one
or two companions, but others come only when he has earned a greater
reputation, met more people, and proven himself a true friend and
ally to these NPCs.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Henchmen can come from any
source. Most often they are at first mere hirelings or followers who,
through distinctive actions, come to the attention of the player
character. Some may be higher level, more skilled hirelings who
develop a bond to the player character through long employment.
Others may be followers who have sound advice for the player
character.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A henchman is always of lower
level than the PC. Should he ever equal or surpass the PC's level,
the henchman leaves forever; it is time for him to try his luck in
the real world. In some ways, the player character is the mentor and
the henchman his student. When the student has learned as much as the
teacher, it is time for him to go out on his own.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Henchmen are more than just
loyal followers; they are friends and allies. Naturally, they expect
to be treated as such. They have little need for those who do not
trust them or treat them coldly. Abusiveness or taking advantage of
the friendship quickly ends the relationship. Just as players must
with their own friends, player characters must be sensitive to the
needs and feelings of their henchmen. Furthermore, henchmen attach
themselves to a particular player character, not a group of player
characters. Thus it is only under the direst of circumstances that a
henchman accepts the orders of another PC. Should his friend (the
player character) fall, the henchman sees to his needs. He doesn't
abandon him and continue on with the other player characters unless
this is clearly the only way to aid his friend.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A PC's Charisma determines
the maximum number of henchmen he can have. This is a lifetime limit,
not just a maximum possible at any given time. In a world where the
fallen can be restored to life, it is expected that a man would make
this effort for his dearest friends, both player characters and
henchmen. For example, Rupert the half-elf has had seven henchmen,
but all have fallen for one reason or another. Rupert's Charisma is
15, so with the death of his latest henchman, no more come to join
him. (Word has obviously gotten around that Rupert's friends tend to
meet unpleasant ends, and he doesn't even have the decency to bring
them back to life! Even if he had tried to raise his henchmen and
failed, Rupert would still be viewed as a jinx, bad luck for those
around him.)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Attracting a henchman is
fairly difficult. One cannot advertise for friends with any great
success. They grow and develop from other relationships. A henchman
can be found by placing trust in a skilled hireling. Heroic deeds
(saving the life of an NPC) can create a strong and instant bond.
Love certainly can form this bond. The player and the DM must trust
their own judgment to determine when an NPC becomes a henchman. There
is no clear line an NPC must cross to make the transition from
hireling to henchman. Instead, it is a slide from one status to the
other.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once an NPC becomes a
henchman, the player gains a high degree of control over the
character. He should be responsible for the record keeping for that
character. It is almost, but not quite, like having a new PC for the
player. If the DM allows it, the player can have all information
regarding the abilities of the henchman, although the DM may choose
not to reveal this information. The player is allowed to make nearly
all decisions for the NPC, but the DM can overrule any action as
being out of character.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are certain things
henchmen do not do. They do not give away or loan out magical items.
They do not allow others free access to their spell books. They do
not tolerate spell use that questions their loyalty (</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>detect
lie</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> or </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>know
alignment</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> cast upon
them). They do not accept less than their due share. In general,
within these limits, henchmen do what is desired of them. The DM can
at any time dictate the actions of a henchman, since the character is
still an NPC.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a PC is not attentive to
the wishes and needs of his henchmen, or if he abuses and humiliates
them, he can expect the worst. This is the stuff mutinies and
rebellions are made of. Should an abusive player character fall at
the hands of a once-loyal henchman, he has only himself to blame.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	On the other hand, not all
henchmen are paragons of loyalty. The player character must always be
aware that henchmen are sometimes not what they seem. They can be a
means to get at the player character. Throughout history, many a
cruel and cunning villain has posed as a true companion, waiting for
his chance to strike or spy on his friend.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Player
Character Obligations </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>	</b></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Whenever
a player character takes on a hireling, follower, or henchman, he has
committed himself to certain obligations and customs that surround
such agreements. Some of these are obvious, having been worked out
between the player character and the NPC in advance. Usually the wage
and term of service are settled upon before any agreement is reached.
For hirelings and followers, this is a set amount of money each day,
week, or month, or a fee for a specific task. Henchmen commonly
receive a portion (half a normal share) of all treasure and magic
found on adventures. A player character is normally expected to
contribute a little more from his own funds, however.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Other obligations of the
player character are varied. Some must always be considered, while
others almost never come into effect. A player character is expected
to provide meals and boarding (unless the NPC has a home nearby).
This is the most common obligation and applies to NPCs of all walks
of life. For those engaged in more dangerous pursuits, however,
additional concessions must be granted. Since horses are expensive,
player characters should be ready to cover the cost of mounts lost in
combat or on campaign. It is unreasonable to expect a mercenary to
buy a new mount from his meager savings. Likewise, other items of war
craft--weapons and armor--must be replaced by the player character.
All soldiers are expected to provide their own equipment when they
are first employed, but the player character must replace all losses.
Certainly all player characters are expected to pay the cost of
special transport--securing passage on ships and arranging wagons for
baggage. Of the grimmer duties, player characters are expected to pay
for a decent (though hardly lavish) interment.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One of the more unusual
obligations of a player character is to ransom his men. This is
especially true of men lost during a campaign. The greater number of
soldiers lost in a battle are not slain but captured. Common practice
of the medieval period was to officially ransom these prisoners for
well-established prices. A common yeoman footman might ransom for 2
gp, a minor priest for 80 gp, a knight's squire for 200 gp, and a
king's man for 500 gp. These are paid for by the lord of the
prisoner. A player character (as a lord and master) is expected to do
the same. Of course, the player character can pass much of this cost
on to his own subjects and the relatives of the prisoner. Thus men
might languish for long periods in the hands of the enemy before
their ransom was raised. Furthermore, should a player character
ransom a hireling, follower, or henchman, he has every reason to
expect loyal service from that man in the future. After all, he has
demonstrated his willingness to save that NPC from hardship and
death.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In a fantasy world, a player
character is also expected to bear the cost of magical spells cast to
the benefit of his men. He may arrange to have his men blessed before
battle or healed after it. He shouldn't grumble about the expense,
because the spells also make good tactical sense. The </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>bless</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell increases the success of his army in the field. Magical cures
get his army back on its feet quicker. All these things can make him
very successful while also making him popular with his hired men.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, the player character
is expected to make an effort to raise or restore slain henchmen.
This is not a normal expectation of hirelings or followers (although
it can happen in extreme cases). The effort should be honest and
true. A player character shouldn't fool himself into thinking no one
will notice if he doesn't do his utmost. The player character who
returns from an adventure minus his henchman is automatically under a
cloud of suspicion, despite his most vehement protests. A player
character must take great care to maintain his reputation as a good
and upright employer.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Before a character can do
anything in the dungeon or the wilderness, he has to be able to see
what he is doing. If a character can't see a target, his chances of
hitting it are very small. If he can't see, he can't read a scroll or
a large &quot;Keep Out&quot; sign on the wall. In the AD&amp;D game,
characters can see set distances and often by fantastic means that
defy logic.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>	</b></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
first limitation on vision is how far away an object can be before it
cannot be seen clearly. Size and weather have a great effect on this.
Mountains can be seen from great distances, 60 to 100 miles or more,
yet virtually no detail can be seen. On level ground, the horizon is
about five to 12 miles away, but a character usually cannot see a
specific object that far away. The limit of vision for seeing and
identifying man-sized objects is much less than this.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Under optimum conditions, the
maximum range at which a man-sized object can be seen is about 1,500
yards, if it is moving. If the object doesn't move, it usually cannot
be seen at this distance. Even if it is moving, all that can be seen
is a moving object. The character cannot tell what it is or what it
is doing.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At 1,000 yards, both moving
and stationary man-sized objects can be spotted. General size and
shape can be determined, but exact identifications are impossible. It
is not likely that creature type can be identified at this range,
unless the creature has a very unique shape.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At 500 yards, general
identifications can be made. Size, shape, color, and creature type
are all distinguishable. Individuals still cannot be identified,
unless they are distinctively dressed or separated from the rest of
the group. Livery and heraldic symbols or banners can be seen if
large and bold. Most coats of arms cannot be distinguished at this
distance. General actions can be ascertained with confidence.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At 100 yards, individuals can
be identified (unless, of course, their features are concealed).
Coats of arms are clear. Most actions are easily seen, although small
events are unclear.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At 10 yards, all details but
the smallest are clear. Emotions and actions are easily seen,
including such small actions as pick-pocketing (if it is detectable).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of course, conditions are
seldom perfect. There are a number of factors that can reduce
visibility and alter the ranges at which things can be spotted and
identified. Table 62 lists the effects of different types of
conditions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All ranges are given in
yards.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&quot;Movement&quot;
indicates the maximum distance at which a moving figure can be seen.
&quot;Spotted&quot; is the maximum distance a moving or a stationary
figure can be seen. &quot;Type&quot; gives the maximum distance at
which the general details of a figure can be seen--species or race,
weapons, etc. &quot;ID&quot; range enables exact (or reasonably
exact) identification. &quot;Detail&quot; range means small actions
can be seen clearly.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are many factors other
than weather that affect viewing. Size is an important factor. When
looking at a small creature (size S), all categories are reduced to
the next lower category (except the &quot;detail&quot; range, which
remains unchanged). Thus, under clear conditions, the ranges for
seeing a small creature are &quot;movement&quot; at 1,000 yards,
&quot;spotted&quot; at 500 yards, &quot;type&quot; at 100 yards, and
&quot;ID&quot; and &quot;detail&quot; at 10 yards.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When sighting large
creatures, the &quot;movement,&quot; &quot;spotting,&quot; and &quot;type&quot;
ranges are doubled. Exceptionally large creatures can be seen from
even greater distances. Large groups of moving creatures can be seen
at great distances. Thus, it is easy to see a herd of buffalo or an
army on the march.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The ranges given in Table 62
do not take terrain into account. All ranges are based on flat, open
ground. Hills, mountains, tall grass, and dense woods all drastically
reduce the chances of seeing a creature. (The terrain does not alter
sighting ranges, only the chances of seeing a creature.) Thus, even
though on a clear day woods may hide a bear until he is 30 yards
away, it is still a clear day for visibility. The bear, once seen,
can be quickly and easily identified as a bear. The DM has more
information on specific terrain effects on sighting.</font></p>

passes in all AD&amp;D game worlds. Weeks slip away as wizards
research spells. Days go by as characters ride across country. Hours
pass while exploring ruins. Minutes flash by during battles. All of
these are passages of time.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are two different types
of time that are talked about in these rules. </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Game
time</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> is the
imaginary time that passes for the characters in the game. </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Real
time</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> is the time in
the real world, the time that passes for the players and DM as they
play the AD&amp;D game. The two times are very different; players and
DMs should be careful to distinguish game time from real time.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, when the
character Delsenora researches a spell for three weeks, this is three
weeks of game time. Delsenora is out of action as three weeks pass in
the campaign world. Since nothing interesting at all happens to
Delsenora during this research time, it should require only a minute
or two of real time to handle the situation. The exchange in real
time is something like this:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Louise (Delsenora's

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>DM:</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
&quot;OK, it'll take three weeks. Nothing happens to her. While she's
doing that, the rest of you get a chance to heal your wounds and do
some stuff that you've been ignoring. Johann [pointing at another
player], you'd better spend some time at the church. The patriarch's
been a little upset that you haven't been attending ceremonies.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Jon (Johann's player):</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">

&quot;The patriarch mumbles something about failing in your duties to
your deity, and he rubs his holy symbol a lot. You know, it's not

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Jon:</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And so three weeks of game
time flash by in brief minutes of real time.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The importance of game time
is that as a campaign progresses, characters tend to become involved
in different time-consuming projects. Three characters may set off on
a four-week overland journey, while a wizard researches for six
weeks. At the inn, a fighter rests and heals his wounds for two
weeks. It is important to note how much time passes during different
tasks, so the activities of different characters can be followed.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Campaign time is measured
just as it is in real life: years, months, weeks, days, hours,
minutes, and seconds. But, since this is a fantasy game, the DM can
create entirely different calendars for his world. There may be only
10 months in the year or 63 days to a month. When beginning play,
these things are not tremendously important, so players need not
worry about them right away. With continued adventuring, players
eventually become familiar with the calendar of the campaign.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Rounds</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
and </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>turns</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
are units of time that are often used in the AD&amp;D game,
particularly for spells and combat. A round is approximately equal to
a minute (it is not exactly one minute, so as to grant the DM some
flexibility during combat). A turn is equal to 10 minutes of game
time. Turns are normally used to measure specific tasks (such as
searching) and certain spells. Thus, a spell that lasts 10 turns is
equal to 100 minutes or one and two-thirds hours.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Closely related to time is
movement. Clearly your character is able to move; otherwise,
adventures would be rather static and boring. But how fast can he
move? If a large, green carrion crawler is scuttling after Rath, is
the redoubtable dwarf fast enough to escape? Could Rath outrun an
irritated but heavily loaded elf? Sooner or later these
considerations become important to player characters.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A character can normally walk
his movement rate in </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>tens
of yards</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> in a
single round. An unencumbered human can walk 120 yards (360 feet),
slightly more than a football field, in one minute. A dwarf,
similarly equipped, can walk 60 yards in the same time. This walk is
at a fairly brisk, though not strenuous, pace that can be kept up for
long periods of time.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, a character may have
to move slower than this pace. If the character is carrying
equipment, he may move slower because of the encumbrance, if this
optional rule is used (see &quot;Encumbrance&quot; in Chapter 6:
Money and Equipment). As the character carries more gear, he
gradually slows down until he reaches the point where he can barely
move at all.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a character is moving
through a dungeon or similar setting, his movement rate corresponds
to </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>tens of feet</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
per round (rather than the tens of yards per round of outside
movement). It is assumed that the character is moving more
cautiously, paying attention to what he sees and hears while avoiding
traps and pitfalls. Again, this rate can be lowered if the optional
encumbrance system is used.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Characters can also move
faster than the normal walking pace. In the dungeon (or anytime the
character is using his dungeon movement rate), the character can
automatically increase his movement to that of his normal walking
pace. In doing so, however, he suffers a -1 penalty to his chance of
being surprised and gives a +1 bonus to others on their chance of
being surprised by him (the rapidly moving character is not taking
care to conceal the noise of his passage in the echoing confines of
the underground). Furthermore, the character does not notice traps,
secret doors, or other unusual features.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It is also certainly possible
for a character to jog or run--an especially useful thing when being
chased by creatures tougher than he cares to meet. The simplest
method for handling these cases is to roll an initiative die. If the
fleeing character wins, he increases the distance between himself and
his pursuers by 10 times the difference in the two dice (in feet or
yards, whichever the DM feels is most appropriate). This is repeated
each turn until the character escapes or is captured. (If this seems
unrealistic, remember that fear and adrenaline can do amazing
things!)</font></p>

Rule) </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If your DM wants greater
precision in a chase, the speeds of those involved in the chase can
be calculated exactly. (But this is time-consuming and can slow down
an exciting chase.) Using this optional rule, a character can always
double his normal movement rate (in yards) to a jog. Thus, a
character with a movement rate of 12 can jog 240 yards in a round.
While jogging, a character can automatically keep going for the
number of rounds equal to his Constitution. After this limit has been
reached, the player must roll a successful Constitution check at the
end of each additional round spent jogging. There are no modifiers to
this check. Once a Constitution check is failed, the character must
stop and rest for as many rounds as he spent jogging. After this, he
can resume his jogging pace with no penalties (although the same
limitations on duration apply).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a jogging pace isn't fast
enough, a character can also run. If he rolls a successful Strength
check, he can move at three times his normal rate; if he rolls a
Strength check with a -4 penalty, he can quadruple his normal rate;
if he rolls a Strength check with a -8 penalty, he can quintuple his
normal rate. Failing a Strength check means only that the character
cannot increase his speed to the level he was trying to reach, but he
can keep running at the pace he was at before the failed Strength
check. Once a character fails a Strength check to reach a level of
running, he cannot try to reach that level again in the same run.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Continued running requires a
Constitution check every round, with penalties that depend on how
long and how fast the character has been running. There is a -1
penalty for each round of running at triple speed, a -2 penalty for
each round of running at quadruple speed, and a -3 penalty for each
round of running at quintuple speed (these penalties are cumulative).
If the check is passed, the character can continue at that speed for
the next round. If the check is failed, the character has exhausted
himself and must stop running. The character must rest for at least
one turn.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, Ragnar the thief
has a Strength of 14, a Constitution of 14, and a movement rate of
12. Being pursued by the city guard, he starts jogging at 240 yards a
round. Unfortunately, so do they. His Constitution is a 14, so he can
keep going for at least 14 rounds. He decides to speed up. The player
makes a Strength check, rolling a 7. Ragnar pours on the speed,
increasing to 360 yards per round (triple speed). Some of the
guardsmen drop out of the race, but a few hold in there. Ragnar now
has a -1 penalty to his Constitution check. A 13 is rolled, so he
just barely passes.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But one of the blasted
guardsmen is still on his tail! In desperation, Ragnar tries to go
faster (trying for four times walking speed). The Strength check is
an 18: Ragnar just doesn't have any more oomph in him; he can't run
any faster, but he is still running three times faster than his
walking speed. The player now must roll a Constitution check with a
-2 penalty (for two rounds of running at triple speed). The player
rolls the die and gets a 4--no problem! And just then the last
guardsman drops out of the race. Ragnar takes no chances and keeps
running. Next round another Constitution check is necessary, with a
-3 penalty. The player rolls an 18. Exhausted, Ragnar collapses in a
shadowy alley, taking care to get out of sight.</font></p>

Movement </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A normal day's marching lasts
for 10 hours, including reasonable stops for rest and meals. Under
normal conditions, a character can walk twice his movement rate in
miles in those 10 hours. Thus, an unencumbered man can walk 24 miles
across clear terrain.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Characters can also </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>force
march</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
intentionally hurrying along, at the risk of exhaustion. Force
marching enables a character to travel 2 ½ times his movement rate
in miles (thus, a normal man could force march 30 miles in a day). At
the end of each day of the march, the character or creature must roll
a Constitution check. Large parties (such as army units) make the
check at the average Constitution of the group (weaker members are
supported, encouraged, and goaded by their peers). Creatures must
roll a saving throw vs. death at the end of each day's force marching
(since they lack Constitution scores). A -1 penalty is applied to the
check for each consecutive day spent force marching. If the check is
passed, the force marching pace can be continued the next day. If the
check fails, no more force marching attempts can be made until the
characters have completely recovered from the ordeal. Recovery
requires half a day per day of force marching.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even if the Constitution
check fails, the character can continue overland movement at his
normal rate.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One drawback of force
marching is that each day of force marching results in a -1 penalty
to all attack rolls. This modifier is cumulative. Half a day's rest
is required to remove one day's worth of force marching penalty.
Characters who have managed to force march for eight straight days
suffer a -8 penalty to their attack rolls; it takes four days of rest
to return to no attack roll penalty.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Overland movement rates can
be increased or decreased by many factors. Terrain can speed or slow
movement. Well-tended roads allow faster marching, while trackless
mountains slow marches to a snail's pace. Lack of food, water, and
sleep weaken characters. Poor weather slows their pace. All these
factors are detailed in the DMG.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>	</b></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">All
characters are either untrained swimmers or proficient swimmers.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When the DM determines the
swimming ability of characters, the decision should be based on his
campaign. If the campaign is centered around a large body of water,
or if a character grew up near the sea, chances are good that the
character knows how to swim. However, being a sailor does not
guarantee that a character can swim. Many a medieval mariner or
black-hearted pirate never learned how to swim and so developed a
morbid fear of the water! This is one of the things that made
&quot;walking the plank&quot; such a fearful punishment. Furthermore,
some character races are normally suspicious of water and swimming.
While these may vary from campaign to campaign, dwarves and halflings
often don't know how to swim.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Untrained swimmers are a
fairly hapless lot. When they are unencumbered, they can manage a
rough dog-paddle in relatively calm waters. If the waters are rough,
the current strong, or the depth excessive (at sea or far out on a
lake), untrained swimmers may panic and sink. If weighed down with
enough gear to reduce their movement rate, they sink like stones,
unable to keep their heads above water. In no way do they make any
noticeable progress (unless, of course, the object is to sink beneath
the surface).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Proficient swimmers are able
to swim, dive, and surface with varying degrees of success. All
proficient characters are able to swim half their current land
movement rate times 10 in yards, provided they are not wearing metal
armor. A character with a movement rate of 12 could swim 60 yards
(180 feet) in a round. Characters whose movement rates have been
reduced to 1/3 or less of normal (due to gear) or who are wearing
metal armor cannot swim--the weight of the gear pulls the character
under. They can still walk on the bottom, however, at 1/3 their
current movement rate.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Proficient swimmers can
double their swimming speed, if a successful Strength check is rolled
(vs. half the character's normal Strength score). For a character
with a movement rate of 12, a successful check means he can swim 120
yards in one round, an Olympic-class performance.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Like running, swimming is not
something that a character can do indefinitely. There are several
different speeds a character can choose to swim at, thus moving in
either short sprints or a slower, but longer-lasting, pace.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If swimming at half normal
speed or treading water, the character can maintain this for a number
of hours equal to his Constitution score (although he will have to
abandon most of his gear). After a character swims for a number of
hours equal to his Constitution, a Constitution check must be made
for each additional hour. For each extra hour of swimming, 1
Constitution point is temporarily lost (regaining lost ability points
is explained in the next column).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Each hour spent swimming
causes a cumulative penalty of -1 to all attack rolls.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All this assumes calm water.
If the seas are choppy, a Constitution check should be made every
hour spent swimming, regardless of the character's Constitution.
Rough seas can require more frequent checks; heavy seas or storms may
require a check every round. The DM may decide that adverse
conditions cause a character's Constitution score to drop more
rapidly than 1 point per hour.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a swimming character fails
a Constitution check, he must tread water for half an hour before he
can continue swimming (this counts as time spent swimming, for
purposes of Constitution point loss).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A character drowns if his
Constitution score drops to 0.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>	A freak wave sweeps Fiera
(an elf) overboard during the night. Fortunately, she can swim and
knows that land is nearby. Bravely, she sets out through calm water.
Her Constitution score is 16. After 14 hours of steady swimming, she
makes out an island on the horizon. Two hours later she is closer,
but still has some way to go. During the next hour (her 17th in the
water), her Constitution drops to 15 (her attack penalty is -17!) and
she must make a Constitution check. A 12 is rolled--she passes. In
the last hour, the 18th, the seas become rough. Her Constitution is
now 13 (the DM ruled that the heavy seas made her lose 2 points of
Constitution this hour), and the DM decides she must pass an extra
Constitution check to reach shore. She rolls a 5 and flops onto
shore, exhausted.</i></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Characters can also swim long
distances at a faster pace, although at increasing risk. Swimming at
the character's normal movement rate (instead of the usual swimming
speed of half the normal movement rate) requires a Constitution check
every hour, reduces Strength and Constitution by 1 point every hour,
and results in a -2 cumulative attack penalty for each hour of
swimming. Characters can swim at twice this speed (quadruple normal
swimming speed), but they must roll a check every turn and suffer the
above penalties for every turn spent swimming. Again, when an ability
score reaches 0, the character sinks and drowns.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Upon reaching shore,
characters can recover lost ability score points and negate attack
penalties by resting. Each day of rest recovers 1d6 ability points
(if both Strength and Constitution points were lost, roll 1d3 for
each ability to determine points recovered) and removes 2d6 points of
attack penalties. Rest assumes adequate food and water. Characters
need not be fully rested before undertaking any activity, although
the adjusted ability scores are treated as the character's current
scores until the character has rested enough to fully recover from
the swim.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To continue the earlier
example with Fiera, after a bad last hour in the water, she reaches
shore. Her Constitution is 13 and she has a -18 penalty to her attack
roll. Exhausted, she finds some ripe fruit and collapses in the shade
of a palm tree. All the next day she rests. At the end of the day she
rolls a 4 on 1d6 and regains 4 points of Constitution, restoring it
to normal. An 8 is rolled to reduce her attack penalty, so the next
day she suffers only a -10 penalty to her attack roll. The next day
of rest lowers this by 6 to -4 and the third day erases it
completely. So in three days she has fully recovered from her 18-hour
ordeal in the water.</font></p>

Your Breath </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Under normal circumstances
(with a good gulp of air and not performing strenuous feats), a
character can hold his breath up to 1/3 his Constitution score in
rounds (rounded up). If the character is exerting himself, this time
is halved (again, rounded up). Characters reduced to 1/3 or less of
their normal movement because of encumbrance are always considered to
be exerting themselves. If unable to get a good gulp of air, these
times are reduced by ½. All characters are able to hold their breath
for one round, regardless of circumstances.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	While attempting to hold his
breath beyond this time, the character must roll a Constitution check
each round. The first check has no modifiers, but each subsequent
check suffers a -2 cumulative penalty. Once a check is failed, the
character must breathe (if he cannot reach the surface, he drowns).</font></p>
<p class="western" >

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">All characters
can dive to a depth of 20 feet in a single round. For each
encumbrance category above unencumbered (or for each point of
movement below the character's normal rate, if this optional system
is used; see &quot;Encumbrance&quot; in Chapter 6), two feet are
added to this depth (the additional weight helps pull the character
down). A short run or a few feet of height adds 10 feet of depth to
the first round of a dive. For every 10 feet of height above the
water, an additional five feet of depth is added, up to a maximum
addition of 20 feet. Thus, with a run and from a height of 40 feet or
more, an unencumbered man can dive 50 feet in a single round.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A character can
normally rise at the rate of 20 feet per round. This rate is reduced
by two feet for every encumbrance category above unencumbered or for
every point of current movement below the character's normal rate (if
this optional system is used). Note that, under the optional
encumbrance system, heavily loaded characters (those who have lost 10
or more points off their normal movement rate because of their
current encumbrance) cannot even swim to the surface. Those simply
floating to the surface (unconscious characters, for example) rise at
a rate that is five feet per round slower than someone similarly
encumbered who is actively swimming up to the surface. It is quite
possible for a moderately weighed-down character to sink if he makes
no effort to stay on the surface.</font></p>

thieves have specialized climbing abilities, all characters are able
to climb to some degree or another. Climbing ability is divided into
three categories: thief, mountaineer, and unskilled.</font></p>

with mountaineering proficiency or those the DM deems to possess this

all types of climbs.</font></p>

Success </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The chance of success of a
climb is calculated by taking the character's skill level (given as a
percentage) and modifying it for his race, the condition of the
surface, and situational modifiers. Table 65 lists the percentages
for the different categories of climbers.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The chance of success given
in Table 65 is modified by many factors. Some of these remain the
same from climb to climb (such as a character's race) and can be
figured into the character's base score. Others depend on the
conditions of a given climb. All factors are listed on Table 66.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The final result of Tables 65
and 66 is the number the character uses for Climbing checks. A
Climbing check is made by rolling percentile dice. If the number
rolled is equal to or less than the number found from Tables 65 and
66, the character succeeds with the Climbing check. Rolls above this
number indicate failure.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A Climbing check must be made
any time a character tries to climb a height of 10 feet or more. This
check is made before the character ascends the first 10 feet of the
climb. If the check is passed, the character can continue climbing.
If the check is failed, the character is unable to find a route and
cannot even attempt the climb.</font></p>

Rates </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Climbing is different from
walking or any other type of movement a character can do. The rate at
which a character moves varies greatly with the different types of
walls and surfaces that must be climbed. Refer to Table 67.
Cross-reference the type of surface to be climbed with the surface
condition. Multiply the appropriate number from the table by the
character's current movement rate. The result is the rate of climb
for the character, in feet per round, in any direction (up, down, or
sideways).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All the movement rates given
on Table 67 are for nonthief characters. Thief characters are able to
climb at double the movement rate for normal characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, Ragnar the thief
and his companion Rupert (a half-elf) are climbing a cliff with rough
ledges. A recent rain has left the surface slightly slippery. Ragnar
has a movement rate of 12 and Rupert's is 8. Ragnar can cover 12 feet
per round (12 x 1 since he is a thief), but Rupert struggles along at
the pace of 4 feet per round (8 x ½). If Ragnar had gone up first
and lowered a rope to Rupert, the half-elf could have climbed at the
rate of 8 feet per round using rope and wall (8 x 1).</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A climbing character cannot
use a two-handed weapon while climbing. The DM can overrule these
penalties if he feels the player character has reached a place of
secure footing. If struck while climbing (for any amount of damage),
the character must make an immediate Climbing check. Failure for a
roped character means he spends a round regaining his balance; an
unroped character falls if he fails this check.</font></p>

<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Climbing
Tools </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Tools are an integral part of
any mountaineer's equipment and all climbs can profit from the use of
tools. Mountaineering tools include rope, pitons (spikes), and ice
axes. However, it is a mistaken belief that the main function of
tools is to aid in a climb. The main purpose of pitons, rope, and the
like is to prevent a disastrous fall. Climbers must rely on their own
skills and abilities, not ropes and spikes, when making a climb.
Accidents happen when people forget this basic rule and trust their
weight to their ropes and pitons.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Therefore, aside from ropes,
other tools do not increase the chance of climbing success. However,
in the case of a fall, climbing tools can reduce the distance fallen.
When a character falls, he can fall only as far as the rope allows,
if being belayed, or as far as twice the distance to the last piton
set (if the piton holds--a piton pulls free 15% of the time when a
sudden stress occurs). The distance fallen depends on how far apart
the pitons have been set. Falling characters fall twice the distance
to the last piton that holds.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, Rath is 15 feet
above his last piton. Suddenly, he slips. He falls the 15 feet to his
piton, plus another 15 feet past his piton since there's 15 feet of
rope between him and the piton, for a total of 30 feet fallen and 3d6
points of falling damage.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Roping characters together
increases individual safety, but it also increases the chance that
more than one person falls. When a character falls, the character(s)
on either side of the falling climber must roll Climbing checks (a
penalty of -10 is applied for each falling character after the first
one to fall). If all checks are successful, the fall is stopped and
no one suffers any damage. If a check is failed, that character also
falls and Climbing checks must be repeated as before. Climbing checks
are made until either the fall is stopped (the climbers on either
side of the falling character[s] successfully roll Climbing checks or
the last nonfalling climber succeeds with his check), or all the
roped-together characters fall.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, a party of five
is roped together as they go up a cliff. Suddenly, Johann falls.
Megarran, immediately above him, and Drelb, following him, must roll
Climbing checks. Megarran passes her check. But Drelb fails and is
snapped off the wall. Now Megarran must make another check with a -10
penalty (for two falling characters), and Targash, who's bringing up
the rear, must also roll a check with a -10 penalty. Both succeed on
their rolls and the fall is stopped.</font></p>

<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Getting
Down </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Aside from jumping or flying,
the quickest way to get down from a height is to rappel. This
requires a rope attached at the top of the climb and a skilled
mountaineer to set up the rappel and to hold the rope at the bottom.
When rappeling down a surface, a Climbing check with a +50 bonus must
be rolled. Free rappels (with the end of the rope unsupported at the
bottom) are also possible, but the modifier is only +30. Of course, a
failed check results in a slip sometime during the rappel (the DM
decides on the damage suffered). A character can rappel at a speed
equal to his normal dungeon movement (120 feet per round for an
unencumbered human). One other thing to bear in mind is that there
must be a landing point at the end of the rope. Rappelling 60 feet
down a 100-foot cliff means the character is either stranded at the
end of the rope or, worse still, rappels right off the end and covers
the last 40 feet much faster than he did the first 60!</font></p>

on Spells </b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The spells are organized
according to their group (priest or wizard) and level. Within each
level, the spells are arranged alphabetically. At the start of each
spell description are the following important game statistics:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Name:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Each spell is
identified by name. In parentheses after the name is the school (for
wizard spells) to which that spell belongs. When more than one is
listed, that spell is common to all schools given.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some spells are reversible
(they can be cast for an effect opposite to that of the standard
spell). This is noted after the spell name. Priests with reversible
spells must memorize the desired version. For example, a priest who
desires a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>cause
light wounds</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell
must petition for this form of the spell when meditating and praying.
Note that severe penalties can result if the spell choice is at
variance with the priest's alignment (possible penalties include
denial of specific spells, entire spell levels, or even all spells
for a certain period). The exact result (if any) depends on the
reaction of the priest's patron deity, as determined by the DM.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Reversible wizard spells
operate similarly. When the spell is learned, both forms are recorded
in the wizard's spell books. However, the wizard must decide which
version of the spell he desires to cast when memorizing the spell,
unless the spell description specifically states otherwise. For
example, a wizard who has memorized </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>stone
to flesh</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> and
desires to cast </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>flesh
to stone</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> must wait
until the latter form of the spell can be memorized (i.e., rest eight
hours and study). If he can memorize two 6th-level spells, he could
memorize each version once or one version twice.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>School:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In parentheses
after the spell name is the name of the school of magic to which the
spell belongs. For wizard spells, this defines which spells a wizard
specialist can learn, depending on the wizard's school of
specialization. For priest spells, the school notation is used only
for reference purposes, to indicate which school the spell is
considered to belong to, in case the DM needs to know for spell
resistance (for example, elves' resistance to charm spells).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Sphere:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This entry
appears only for priest spells and identifies the sphere or spheres
into which each spell falls.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This lists the
distance from the caster at which the spell effect occurs or begins.
A &quot;0&quot; indicates the spell can be used on the caster only,
with the effect embodied within or emanating from him. &quot;Touch&quot;
means the caster can use the spell on others if he can physically
touch them. Unless otherwise specified, all other spells are centered
on a point visible to the caster and within the range of the spell.
The point can be a creature or object if desired. In general, a spell
that affects a limited number of creatures within an area affects
those closest to the center first, unless there are other parameters
operating (such as level or Hit Dice). Spells can be cast through
narrow openings only if both the caster's vision and the spell energy
can be directed simultaneously through the opening. A wizard standing
behind an arrow slit can cast through it; sending a fireball through
a small peephole he is peering through is another matter.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Components:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This lists the
category of components needed, V for verbal, S for somatic, and M for
material. When material components are required, these are listed in
the spell description. Spell components are expended as the spell is
cast, unless otherwise noted. Clerical holy symbols are not lost when
a spell is cast. For cases in which material components are expended
at the end of the spell (</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>free
action, shapechange,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
etc.), premature destruction of the components ends the spell.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Duration:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This lists how
long the magical energy of the spell lasts. Spells of instantaneous
duration come and go the moment they are cast, although the results
of these spells may be permanent and unchangeable by normal means.
Spells of permanent duration last until the effects are negated by
some means, usually by a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>dispel
magic</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">. Some spells
have a variable duration. The caster cannot choose the duration of
spells, in most cases. Spells with set durations (for example, 3
rounds per level of the wizard) must be kept track of by the player.
Spells of variable duration (for example, 3+1d4 rounds) are secretly
recorded by the DM. Your DM may warn you when spell durations are
approaching expiration, but there is usually no sign that a spell is
going to expire; check with your DM to determine exactly how he
handles this issue.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Certain spells can be ended
at will by the caster. In order to dismiss these spells, the original
caster must be within range of the spell's center of effect--within
the same range at which the spell can be cast. The caster also must
be able to speak words of dismissal. Note that only the original
caster can dismiss his spells in this way.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Casting
Time:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This entry is
important, if the optional casting time modifier to initiative is
used. If only a number is given, the casting time is added to the
caster's initiative die rolls. If the spell requires a round or
number of rounds to cast, it goes into effect at the end of the last
round of casting time. If Delsenora casts a spell that takes one
round, it goes into effect at the end of the round in which she
begins casting. If the spell requires three rounds to cast, it goes
into effect at the end of the third round. Spells requiring a turn or
more go into effect at the end of the stated turn.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This lists the
creatures, volume, dimensions, weight, etc., that can be affected by
the spell. Spells with an area or volume that can be shaped by the
caster will, unless the spell description specifically states
otherwise, have a minimum dimension of 10 feet in any direction.
Thus, a cloud that has a 10-foot cube per caster level might, when
cast by a 12th-level caster, be 10-foot x 10-foot x 120-foot, 20-foot
x 20-foot x 30-foot, or any similar combination that totals 12
10-foot cubes. Combinations such as 5-foot x 10-foot x 240-foot are

allowed. Wisdom adjustments to saving throws apply only to
enchantment/charm spells.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Solid physical barriers
provide saving throw bonuses and damage reduction. Cover and
concealment may affect saving throws and damage (the DM has
additional information about this).</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A creature that successfully
saves against a spell with no apparent physical effect (such as a

or </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>magic jar</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">)
may feel a definite force or tingle that is characteristic of a
magical attack, if the DM desires. But the exact hostile spell effect
or creature ability used cannot be deduced from this tingle.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A being's carried equipment
and possessions are assumed to make their saving throws against
special attacks if the creature makes its saving throw, unless the
spell specifically states otherwise. If the creature fails its saving
throw, or if the attack form is particularly potent, saving throws
may have to be rolled to see if any possessions survive, using either
item saving throws (see Chapter 6 of the DMG) or the being's saving
throw. The DM will inform you when this happens.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Any character can voluntarily
forgo a saving throw. This allows a spell or similar attack that
normally grants a saving throw to have full effect on the character.
Likewise, any creature can voluntarily lower its magic resistance,
allowing a spell to automatically function when cast on it. Foregoing
a saving throw or magic resistance roll need not always be voluntary.
If a creature or character can be tricked into lowering its
resistance, the spell will have full effect, even if it is not the
spell the victim believed he was going to receive. The victim must
consciously choose to lower his resistance; it is not sufficient that
he is caught off guard.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, a character
would receive a saving throw if a wizard in the party suddenly
attacked him with a fireball, even if the wizard had been friendly to
that point. However, the same character would not receive a saving
throw if the wizard convinced him that he was about to receive a
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>levitation</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">

lowered their resistances. You must tell your DM when your character
is lowering his resistance.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Spells with multiple

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Spell effects that give

duplicate spell effects are keyed to the caster's level (for example,
a 10th-level illusionist casting a fireball can create a convincing
10-die fireball). Exceeding this limit creates a fatal flaw in the

wizard must have undergone it (a wizard cannot conjure up the twinkle
in a medusa's eye correctly without actually experiencing it--i.e.,
having been turned to stone by one).</font></p>

Extend the spell level control to monsters--the caster can create
monsters only if the total monster Hit Dice are equal to or less than
the caster's level (an 8th-level caster could convincingly do one
hill giant, two ogres, or four 2nd-level fighters).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Illusion spells require a
higher degree of DM-player interaction than other wizard spells. The
timing and staging of such spells by the caster are extremely
important. Effects that appear out of nowhere are not believed unless
the caster takes this into account. On the other hand, an illusionary
fireball cast after a wizard has cast a real one could have
devastating effects.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The caster must maintain a
show of realism at all times when conducting an illusion (if a squad
of low-level fighters is created, the caster dictates their hits,
misses, damage inflicted, apparent wounds, and so forth; the DM
decides whether the bounds of believability have been exceeded).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	NPC illusions require careful
preparation by the DM, including clues to their nature.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Intelligence is the best
defense against illusions. Low and nonintelligent creatures are more
vulnerable to illusions, unless the illusion is completely outside
their experience or the illusion touches on an area of the creatures'
particular competence. Undead are generally immune to illusions, but
they are vulnerable to quasi-real effects, most of which start to
appear in the 4th-level spell list.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Illusions usually cease to
affect a character if they are actively disbelieved. Disbelief must
be stated by the player, based on clues provided by the DM. Players
stating disbelief must give a reason for disbelief based on sensory
information available to the character. Failure to give such a reason
results in failure to disbelieve. The DM can impose additional
requirements or delays in recognizing illusions (such as Intelligence
checks) as needed, such as when one player is obviously parroting a
discovery made by another. Disbelief automatically forfeits a saving
throw if the effect is real.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For NPCs, a saving throw,
Intelligence check, or DM adjudication can be used to determine
disbelief (whichever the DM deems appropriate).</font></p>

distance he desires (within range), and seem to recede, approach, or
remain at a fixed place as desired. The volume of sound created,
however, is directly related to the level of the spellcaster. The
volume is based upon the lowest level at which the spell can be cast,
1st level. The noise of the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>audible
glamer</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> at this
level is that of four men, maximum. Each additional experience level
of the wizard adds a like volume, so that at 2nd level the wizard can
have the spell cause sound equal to that of eight men. Thus, talking,
singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be
created. The auditory illusion created by an </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>audible

have severe limitations. They are completely unable to cause a loss

between; human, humanoid, or any other generally man-shaped bipedal
creature. The caster cannot duplicate a specific individual. The
spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen
form. The duration of the spell is 2d6 rounds plus two additional
rounds per level of experience of the spellcaster. The DM may allow a
saving throw for disbelief under certain circumstances: for example,
if the caster acts in a manner obviously inconsistent with his chosen
role. The spell does not alter the perceived tactile (i.e., touch)
properties of the caster or his equipment, and the ruse can be
discovered in this way.</font></p>

his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally

control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word
or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable way. Thus, a
charmed person would not obey a suicide command, but he might believe
the caster if assured that the only chance to save the caster's life
is for the person to hold back an onrushing red dragon for &quot;just
a minute or two.&quot; Note also that the spell does not endow the
caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those he normally

his commands).</font></p>

entity) or upon a single object that does not exceed 10 cubic feet in
volume per caster level. The object or creature must be seen to be

entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. A successful saving throw means
the spell fails. If insufficient room is available for the desired
growth, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size,
bursting weak enclosures in the process, but it is constrained
without harm by stronger materials--the spell cannot be used to crush
a creature by growth.</font></p>

+1</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> is still only
+1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions,
a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make
its magical effects operate, etc. Weight, mass, and strength are
affected, though. Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and
more effective, a hurled stone would have more mass (and cause more
damage), chains would be more massive, doors thicker, a thin line
turned to a sizeable, longer rope, and so on. A creature's hit
points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but damage rolls
increase proportionately with size.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, a fighter at
160% normal size hits with his long sword and rolls a 6 for damage.
The adjusted damage roll is 10 (that is, 6 x 1.6 = 9.6, rounded up).

negates the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>enlarge</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell or makes creatures or objects smaller. The creature or object
loses 10% of its original size for every level of the caster, to a
minimum of 10% of the original size. Thereafter, the size shrinks by
1-foot increments to less than 1 foot, by 1-inch increments to 1
inch, and by 1/10-inch increments to a minimum of 1/10 of an
inch--the recipient cannot dwindle away to nothingness.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, a 16-foot-tall
giant reduced by a 15th-level wizard (15 steps) would be reduced to
1.6 feet (in nine steps), then to 6/10 of a foot or 7.2 inches (in
one step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the last five steps). A
shrinking object may damage weaker materials affixed to it, but an
object will shrink only as long as the object itself is not damaged.

creature(s) or object(s) affected immediately assumes the mass of a
piece of down. The rate of falling is instantly changed to a mere 2
feet per second (120 feet per round), and no damage is incurred upon
landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell
duration ceases, a normal rate of fall occurs. The spell can be cast
upon the wizard or some other creature or object up to the maximum
range and lasts for one round for each level of the wizard. The
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>feather fall</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This spell enables the caster
to attempt to summon a familiar to act as his aide and companion.
Familiars are typically small creatures, such as cats, frogs,
ferrets, crows, hawks, snakes, owls, ravens, toads, weasels, or even
mice. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying
its sensory powers to its master, conversing with him, and serving as
a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a
time, however, and he has no control over what sort of creature
answers the summoning, if any at all come.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The creature is always more
intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence
points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an
exceptionally long life. The wizard receives the heightened senses of
his familiar, which grants the wizard a +1 bonus to all surprise die
rolls. Normal familiars have 2-4 hit points plus 1 hit point per
caster level, and an Armor Class of 7 (due to size, speed, etc.).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The wizard has an empathic
link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands at a distance
of up to 1 mile. Note that empathic responses from the familiar are
generally fairly basic--while able to communicate simple thoughts,
these are often overwhelmed by instinctual responses. Thus, a ferret
familiar spying on a band of orcs in the woods might lose its train
of thought upon sighting a mouse. Certainly its communications to its
master would be tinged with fear of the &quot;big ones&quot; it was
spying on! The caster cannot see through the familiar's eyes.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If separated from the caster,
the familiar loses 1 hit point each day, and dies if reduced to 0 hit
points. When the familiar is in physical contact with its wizard, it
gains the wizard's saving throws against special attacks. If a
special attack would normally cause damage, the familiar suffers no
damage if the saving throw is successful and half damage if the
saving throw is failed. If the familiar dies, the wizard must
successfully roll an immediate system shock check or die. Even if he
survives this check, the wizard loses 1 point from his Constitution
when the familiar dies.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The power of the conjuration
is such that it can be attempted but once per year. When the wizard
decides to find a familiar, he must load a brass brazier with
charcoal. When this is burning well, he adds 1,000 gp worth of
incense and herbs. The spell incantation is then begun and must be
continued until the familiar comes or the casting time is finished.
The DM secretly determines all results. Note that most familiars are
not inherently magical, nor does a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>dispel
magic</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell send
them away.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Deliberate mistreatment,
failure to feed and care for the familiar, or continuous unreasonable
demands have adverse effects on the familiar's relationship with its
master. Purposely arranging the death of one's own familiar incurs
great disfavor from certain powerful entities, with dire results.</font></p>

Intelligent creatures within the area of effect at the time the spell

impressed with the spellcaster and make an effort to be his friends

might decide to become helpful; surly gate guards might wax
informative; attacking orcs might spare the caster's life, taking him

allowed a saving throw each round until they escape the area. The DM
should adjust saving throws by circumstance; for example, a creature
charging down an incline that is suddenly greased has little chance
to avoid the effect, but its ability to exit the affected area is
almost assured! The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating
on an item--a rope, ladder rungs, weapon handle, etc. Material
objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while creatures
wielding or employing items receive a saving throw vs. spell to avoid
the effect. If the initial saving throw is failed, the creature
immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made each round

of a multifunction item is discovered per handling (i.e., a 5th-level
wizard could attempt to determine the nature of five different items,
five different functions of a single item, or any combination of the
two). If any attempt at reading fails, the caster cannot learn any

(81% - 100% of the total possible charges), strong (61% - 80%),
moderate (41% - 60%), weak (6% - 40%), or faint (five charges or
less). The faint result takes precedence, so a fully charged </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>ring

includes enemy creatures in a melee. The target creature must be seen
or otherwise detected to be hit, however, so near-total concealment,
such as that offered by arrow slits, can render the spell
ineffective. Likewise, the caster must be able to identify the
target. He cannot direct a magic missile to &quot;Strike the
commander of the legion,&quot; unless he can single out the commander
from the rest of the soldiers. Specific parts of a creature cannot be
singled out. Inanimate objects (locks, etc.) cannot be damaged by the
spell, and any attempt to do so wastes the missiles to no effect.
Against creatures, each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage.</font></p>

capability, he can have them strike a single target creature or

on these senses usually fail. The illusion lasts until struck by an

appropriately--or until the wizard ceases concentration upon the
spell (due to desire, moving, or a successful attack that causes
damage). Saving throws for illusions are explained under &quot;Illusions&quot;

itself, but it does prevent the exercise of mental control through
the barrier. Likewise, a possessing life force is merely kept out. It
would not be expelled if in place before the protection is cast.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Third, the spell prevents
bodily contact by creatures of an extraplanar or conjured nature
(such as aerial servants, elementals, imps, invisible stalkers,
salamanders, water weirds, xorn, and others). This causes the natural
(body) weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to
recoil, if such attacks require touching the protected being. Animals
or monsters summoned or conjured by spells or similar magic are
likewise hedged from the character.</font></p>

the recipient to climb and travel upon vertical surfaces as well as a

victims must be touched and are then allowed a saving throw vs. spell
to negate the effect. The affected creature must have bare hands and
feet in order to climb in this manner, at a movement rate of 6 (3 if
at all encumbered). During the course of the spell, the recipient
cannot handle objects that weigh less than a dagger (one pound), for
such objects stick to his hands and feet. Thus, a wizard will find it
virtually impossible to cast spells if under a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>spider

Sufficient force can pull the recipient free; the DM can assign a

so on. For example, a creature with a Strength of 12 might pull the
subject free if the subject fails a saving throw vs. paralyzation (a
moderately difficult saving throw). The caster can end the spell

spell enables the wizard to play upon natural fears to cause the
target creature to perceive the spellcaster as someone or something
inimical. Without actually knowing what this is, the wizard merely
advances threateningly upon the creature. If the creature does not
make a successful saving throw vs. spell, it turns and flees at
maximum speed as far from the wizard as possible, though items
carried are not dropped. The creature has a saving throw penalty of
-1 for every two experience levels of the caster, to a maximum of -6
at 12th level. Note that a natural (unmodified) roll of 20
automatically succeeds, regardless of saving throw penalties.
Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a
phantasm from its own mind does. Each round after the initial
casting, the creature receives another saving throw, without penalty,
until it successfully saves and the spell is broken. In any event,
the spell functions only against creatures with Intelligences of 2 or
more, and undead are not affected at all.</font></p>

casting the spell. The disc floats approximately 3 feet above the
ground at all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally
within its range of 20 yards at the command of the caster, and will
accompany him at a movement rate of no more than 6. If unguided, it
maintains a constant interval of 6 feet between itself and the

creature if it is successfully cast upon the creature's visual

4. If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed in a
light-proof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the

the ESP does not always reveal what sort of creature it is. If used
as part of a program of interrogation, an intelligent and wary
subject receives an initial saving throw. If successful, the creature
successfully resists and the spell reveals no additional information.

When cast, this causes each subject to feel an instant itching
sensation on some portion of its body. If one round is not
immediately spent scratching the irritated area, the creature is so
affected that the next three rounds are spent squirming and twisting,
effectively worsening its Armor Class by 4 and its attack rolls by 2
during this time. Spell preparations are ruined in the first round
this spell is in effect, but not in the following three rounds. Doing
nothing but scratching the itch for a full round prevents the rest of
the effect. If cast at one creature, the saving throw has a -3
penalty; if cast at two creatures, the saving throw has a -1 penalty;
and if cast at three or four creatures, the saving throw is normal.</font></p>

opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or

wizard-locked door, the spell does not remove the former spell, but
simply suspends its functioning for one turn. In all other cases, it
permanently opens locks or welds--although the former could be closed
and locked again later. It does not raise barred gates or similar
impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines,

and held, or triple locked, opening it requires two </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>knock</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">

wizard creates a magical arrow that speeds to its target as if fired
from the bow of a fighter of the same level as the wizard. No
modifiers for range, nonproficiency, or specialization are used. The
arrow has no attack or damage bonus, but it inflicts 2d4 points of
acid damage (with saving throws for items on the target); there is no
splash damage. For every three levels that the caster has achieved,
the acid, unless somehow neutralized, lasts for another round,
inflicting another 2d4 points of damage each round. So at 3rd-5th
level, the acid lasts two rounds; at 6th-8th level, the acid lasts
for three rounds, etc.</font></p>

himself to come into being around him. These images do exactly what
the wizard does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight
distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be
certain which are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When
an image is struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or
otherwise, it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact
until struck. The images seem to shift from round to round, so that
if the actual wizard is struck during one round, he cannot be picked
out from among his images the next. To determine the number of images
that appear, roll 1d4 and add 1 for every three levels of experience
the wizard has achieved, to a maximum of eight images. At the end of

spell draws on an existing fire source to produce one of two effects,
at the option of the caster. First, it can produce a flashing and
fiery burst of glowing, colored aerial fireworks that lasts one
round. This effect temporarily blinds those creatures in, under, or
within 120 feet of the area and that have an unobstructed line of
sight to the burst. Creatures viewing this are blinded for 1d4+1

thick, writhing stream of smoke to arise from the source and form a
choking cloud that lasts for one round per experience level of the
caster. This covers a roughly spherical volume from the ground or
floor up (or conforming to the shape of a confined area) that totally
obscures vision beyond 2 feet. The smoke fills a volume 100 times

saving throws vs. spell or suffer -2 penalties to all combat rolls

suffers 1 point of damage per caster level.</font></p>

a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end of the rope rises
into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular, as if affixed
at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an
extradimensional space. The spellcaster and up to seven others can
climb up the rope and disappear into this place of safety where no
creature can find them. The rope can be taken into the
extradimensional space if fewer than eight persons have climbed it;
otherwise, it simply stays hanging in the air (extremely strong
creatures might be able to remove it, at the DM's option). Spells
cannot be cast across the interdimensional interface, nor can area
effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of
it as if there were a 3-foot x 5-foot window centered on the rope.
The persons in the extradimensional space must climb down prior to
the end of the spell, or they are dropped from the height at which
they entered the extradimensional space. The rope can be climbed by

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By means of this spell, the
wizard causes his material form to &quot;blink&quot; directly from
one point to another at a random time and in a random direction. This
means that melee attacks against the wizard automatically miss if
initiative indicates they fall after he has blinked.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Each round the spell is in
effect, the wizard rolls 2d8 to determine the timing of the
blink--the result of the dice roll is used as the wizard's initiative
for that round. The wizard disappears and instantaneously reappears
10 feet distant from his previous position. (Direction is determined
by a roll of 1d8: 1 = right ahead, 2 = right, 3 = right behind, 4 =
behind, 5 = left behind, 6 = left, 7 = left ahead, 8 = ahead.) The
caster cannot blink into a solid object; if such is indicated, reroll
the direction. Movable objects of size and mass comparable to the
caster are shoved aside when the caster blinks in. If blinking is
impossible except into a fixed, solid object, the caster is then
trapped on the Ethereal Plane.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	During each round that he
blinks, the spellcaster can be attacked only by opponents who win
initiative or by those who are able to strike both locations at once
(for example, with a breath weapon, fireball, or similar wide-area
attack forms). Opponents with multiple attacks, or those operating
under haste or similar effects, can often strike early enough to have
at least one attack against the caster.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the spellcaster holds off
his attack (if any) until after the blink, the 2d8 delay until the
blink is added to his normal 1d10 initiative roll (thus, he probably
attacks last in the round). The spellcaster can also try to get his
attack in before he blinks (he must announce his intent before
rolling the 2d8 for blink timing and the 1d10 for initiative). In
this case, the caster compares the two dice rolls, hoping that his
initiative roll is lower than his blink roll (the two rolls are </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>not</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
added if he is trying to attack before he blinks). If so, he attacks
according to his initiative roll, then blinks according to the blink
roll. If his blink roll is lower than his initiative roll, however,
he blinks first and then attacks in whatever direction he's facing
(he must go through with his attack, even if he is facing in the
wrong direction to affect anyone).</font></p>

state that is impossible to distinguish from death. Although the

smell, hear, and know what is going on, no feeling or sight of any

not felt and no reaction occurs; damage is only half normal. In
addition, paralysis, poison, and energy-level drain cannot affect an
individual under the influence of this spell. Poison injected or
otherwise introduced into the body takes effect when the spell
recipient is no longer under the influence of this spell, although a

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A fireball is an explosive
burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar and delivers damage
proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it--1d6 points of
damage for each level of experience of the spellcaster (up to a
maximum of 10d6). The burst of the fireball creates little pressure
and generally conforms to the shape of the area in which it occurs.
The fireball fills an area equal to its normal spherical volume
(roughly 33,000 cubic feet--thirty-three 10-foot x 10-foot x 10-foot
cubes). Besides causing damage to creatures, the fireball ignites all
combustible materials within its burst radius, and the heat of the
fireball melts soft metals such as gold, copper, silver, etc. Exposed
items require saving throws vs. magical fire to determine if they are
affected, but items in the possession of a creature that rolls a
successful saving throw are unaffected by the fireball.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The wizard points his finger
and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is
to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it
impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the
prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results
in an early detonation). Creatures failing their saving throws each
suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful saving
throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half
damage (the DM rolls the damage and each affected creature suffers
either full damage or half damage [round fractions down], depending
on whether the creature saved or not).</font></p>

First, the wizard can cause normal arrows or crossbow bolts to become
magical flaming missiles for one round. The missiles must be nocked
and drawn (or cocked) at the completion of the spell. If they are not
loosed within one round, they are consumed by the magic. For every
five levels the caster has achieved, up to 10 arrows or bolts can be
affected. The arrows inflict normal damage, plus 1 point of fire
damage to any target struck. They may also cause incendiary damage.
This version of the spell is used most often in large battles.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The second version of this
spell enables the caster to hurl fiery bolts at opponents within
range. Each bolt inflicts 1d6 points of piercing damage, plus 4d6
points of fire damage. Only half the fire damage is inflicted if the
creature struck successfully saves vs. spell. The caster receives one
bolt for every five experience levels (two bolts at 10th level, three
at 15th level, etc.). Bolts must be used on creatures within 20 yards
of each other and in front of the wizard.</font></p>

lanterns--to dance wildly and has a 5% chance per level of experience
of the spellcaster to extinguish even such lights. It also fans large
fires outward 1d6 feet in the direction of the wind's movement. It
forces back small flying creatures 1d6 x 10 yards and causes
man-sized beings to be held motionless if attempting to move against
its force. It slows larger-than-man-sized flying creatures by 50% for
one round. It blows over light objects, disperses most vapors, and
forces away gaseous or unsecured levitating creatures. Its path is a

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Upon casting this spell, the
wizard releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that inflicts
1d6 points of damage per level of the spellcaster (maximum damage per
level of 10d6) to each creature within its area of effect. A
successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half (round
fractions down). The bolt begins at a range and height decided by the
caster and streaks outward in a direct line from the casting wizard
(for example, if a 40-foot bolt was started at 180 feet from the
wizard, the far end of the bolt would reach 220 feet (180 + 40). The
lightning bolt may set fire to combustibles, sunder wooden doors,
splinter up to a half-foot thickness of stone, and melt metals with a
low melting point (lead, gold, copper, silver, bronze). Saving throws
must be rolled for objects that withstand the full force of a stroke
(see the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>fireball</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell). If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or
breaks through it (i.e., the saving throw fails), the bolt continues.
A bolt can breach 1 inch of wood or half an inch of stone per caster
level, up to a maximum of 1 foot of wood or half a foot of stone.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The lightning bolt's area of
effect is chosen by the spellcaster: either a forked bolt 10 feet
wide and 40 feet long or a single bolt 5 feet wide and 80 feet long.
If a bolt cannot reach its full length, because of an unyielding
barrier (such as a stone wall), the lightning bolt rebounds from the
barrier toward its caster, ending only when it reaches its full
length.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example: An 80-foot-long
stroke is begun at a range of 40 feet, but it hits a stone wall at 50
feet. The bolt travels 10 feet, hits the wall, and rebounds for 70
feet back toward its creator (who is only 50 feet from the wall, and
so is caught in his own lightning bolt!).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM might allow reflecting
bolts. When this type of lightning bolt strikes a solid surface, the
bolt reflects from the surface at an angle equal to the angle of
incidence (like light off a mirror). A creature crossed more than
once by the bolt must roll a saving throw for every time it is
crossed, but it still suffers either full damage (if one saving throw
is missed) or half damage (if all saving throws are made).</font></p>

meteors are treated as missiles hurled by the wizard with a +2 bonus

one meteor per round. In addition to releasing the missile, the
caster can perform other actions in the round, including
spellcasting, melee, or device use. Spells requiring concentration
force the wizard to forgo the rest of the missiles to maintain
concentration. Also, if the wizard fails to maintain an exact mental
count of the number of missiles he has remaining, he has
involuntarily lost the remaining portion of the spell.</font></p>

surrounding him, or otherwise affect him. The victim does not age,
grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells while in this state. He is not
aware of his surroundings. If the sepia snake misses its target, it

in such a manner as to make the action sound reasonable; asking the
creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself,

effect of the spell. However, a suggestion that a pool of acid was
actually pure water and that a quick dip would be refreshing is
another matter. Urging a red dragon to stop attacking the wizard's
party so that the dragon and party could jointly loot a rich treasure
elsewhere is likewise a reasonable use of the spell's power.</font></p>

suggestion can continue in effect for a considerable duration, such

will trigger a special action can also be specified; if the condition
is not met before the spell expires, the action will not be
performed. If the target successfully rolls its saving throw, the
spell has no effect. Note that a very reasonable suggestion causes
the saving throw to be made with a penalty (such as -1, -2, etc.) at
the discretion of the DM. Undead are not subject to suggestion.</font></p>

rounds plus one round for each level of the caster. Those who fail
are checked by the DM for actions each round for the duration of the
spell, or until the &quot;wander away for the duration of the spell&quot;
result occurs.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Wandering creatures move as
far from the caster as possible, according to their most typical mode
of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Saving
throws and actions are checked at the beginning of each round. Any
confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy
and acts according to its basic nature.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If there are many creatures
involved, the DM may decide to assume average results. For example,
if there are 16 orcs affected and 25% could be expected to make the
saving throw, then four are assumed to have succeeded. Out of the
other 12, one wanders away, four attack the nearest creature, six
stand confused, and the last acts normally but must check next round.
Since the orcs are not near the party, the DM decides that two
attacking the nearest creature attack each other, one attacks an orc
that saved, and one attacks a confused orc, which strikes back. The
next round, the base is 11 orcs, since four originally saved and one
wandered off. Another one wanders off, five stand confused, four
attack, and one acts normally.</font></p>

the caster might learn, &quot;The wizard Sniggel spies on us from

spell enables the caster to excavate 125 cubic feet of earth, sand,
or mud per round (i.e., a cubic hole 5 feet on a side). In later
rounds the caster can expand an existing hole or start a new one. The
material thrown from the excavation scatters evenly around the pit.
If the wizard continues downward past 20 feet in earth, there is a
15% chance that the pit collapses. This check is made for every 5
feet dug beyond 20 feet. Sand tends to collapse after 10 feet, mud
fills in and collapses after 5 feet, and quicksand fills in as
rapidly as it is dug.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Any creature at the edge
(within 1 foot) of a pit must roll a successful Dexterity check or
fall into the hole. Creatures moving rapidly toward a pit dug
immediately before them must roll a saving throw vs. spell to avoid
falling in. Any creature in a pit being excavated can climb out at a
rate decided by the DM. A creature caught in a collapsing pit must
roll a saving throw vs. death to avoid being buried; it escapes the
pit if successful. Tunneling is possible with this spell as long as
there is space available for the material removed. Chances for
collapse are doubled and the safe tunneling distance is half of the
safe excavation depth, unless such construction is most carefully
braced and supported.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The spell is also effective
against creatures of earth and rock, particularly clay golems and
those from the Elemental Plane of Earth. When cast upon such a
creature, it suffers 4d6 points of damage. A successful saving throw
vs. spell reduces this damage to half.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To activate the spell, the
spellcaster needs a miniature shovel and tiny bucket and must
continue to hold them while each pit is excavated. These items
disappear at the conclusion of the spell.</font></p>

error, and the wizard always arrives at exactly the spot
desired--whether by simply visualizing the area (within spell
transfer distance, of course) or by stating direction such as, &quot;300
yards straight downward,&quot; or, &quot;upward to the northwest, 45
degree angle, 420 yards.&quot; If the wizard arrives in a place that
is already occupied by a solid body, he remains trapped in the Astral
Plane. If distances are stated and the spellcaster arrives with no
support below his feet (i.e., in mid-air), falling and damage result
unless further magical means are employed. All that the wizard wears
or carries, subject to a maximum weight equal to 500 pounds of

The target of a tentacle attack must roll a saving throw vs. spell.
If this succeeds, the subject suffers 1d4 points of damage from
contact with the tentacle; the tentacle is then destroyed. Failure to
save indicates that the damage inflicted is 2d4 points, the ebon
member is wrapped around its subject, and damage will be 3d4 points
on the second and all succeeding rounds. Since these tentacles have
no intelligence to guide them, there is the possibility that they
entwine any object--a tree, post, pillar, even the wizard himself--or
continue to squeeze a dead opponent. A grasping hold established by a

wizard causes a normal fire source, such as a brazier, flambeau, or
bonfire, to serve as a magical agent, for from this source he causes
a gossamer veil of multihued flame to encircle the fire at a distance
of 5 feet. Any creatures observing the fire or the dancing circle of
flame around it must successfully roll a saving throw vs. spell or be
charmed into remaining motionless and gazing, transfixed, at the
flames. While so charmed, creatures are subject to suggestions of 12

Wisdom. The caster can give one such suggestion to each creature, and
the suggestions need not be the same. The maximum duration for such a

fire trap (by noticing the characteristic markings required to cast

trap (failure detonates the trap immediately). An unsuccessful dispel
does not detonate the spell. The caster can use the trapped object
without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the spell was
specifically attuned when cast (the exact method usually involves a
keyword). When the trap is discharged, there is an explosion of
5-foot radius from the spell's center; all creatures within this area
must roll saving throws vs. spell. Damage is 1d4 points plus 1 point
per level of the caster, or half this (round up) for creatures
successfully saving. (Under water, this ward inflicts half damage and

wizard causes an illusion that hides the actual terrain within the
area of effect. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to look like
a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable
terrain. A pond can be made to look like a grassy meadow, a precipice
like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth
road. The hallucinatory terrain persists until a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>dispel

mudpots), the illusion will no doubt be noticed the instant one

entangle to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or
force a way through at a movement rate of 1 per round (or 2 if the
creatures are larger than man size). The area must contain brush and
trees for this spell to work. Briars, bushes, creepers, lianas,
roots, saplings, thistles, thorn, trees, vines, and weeds become
thick and overgrown so as to form a barrier. The area of effect is

other</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell is a
powerful magic that completely alters the form and ability, and
possibly the personality and mentality, of the recipient. Of course,
while a creature with a lower Intelligence can be polymorphed in form
into something with a higher Intelligence, it will not gain that
creature's mental ability. The reverse--polymorphing a higher
Intelligence creature into one of significantly lower
Intelligence--results in a creature much more intelligent than
appearances would lead one to believe. The polymorphed creature must
succeed on a system shock (see Table 3) roll to see if it survives
the change. After this, it must make a special Intelligence check to
see if it retains its personality (see following).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The polymorphed creature
acquires the form and physical abilities of the creature it has been
polymorphed into, while retaining its own mind. Form includes natural
Armor Class (that due to skin toughness, but not due to quickness,
magical nature, etc.), physical movement abilities (walking,
swimming, and flight with wings, but not plane shifting, blinking,
teleporting, etc.), and attack routines (claw/claw/bite, swoop, rake,
and constriction, but not petrification, breath weapons, energy
drain, etc.). Hit points and saving throws do not change from the
original form. Noncorporeal forms cannot be assumed. Natural
shapeshifters (lycanthropes, dopplegangers, higher level druids,
etc.) are affected for but one round, and can then resume their
normal form.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If slain, the polymorphed
creature reverts to its original form, though it remains dead. (Note
that most creatures generally prefer their own form and will not
willingly stand the risk of being subjected to this spell!) As class
and level are not attributes of form, abilities derived from either
cannot be gained by this spell, nor can exact ability scores be
specified.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When the polymorph occurs,
the creature's equipment, if any, melds into the new form (in
particularly challenging campaigns, the DM may allow protective
devices, such as a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>ring
of protection</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">, to
continue operating effectively). The creature retains its mental
abilities, including spell use, assuming the new form allows
completion of the proper verbal and somatic components and the
material components are available. Creatures not used to a new form
might be penalized at the DM's option (for example, -2 to attack
rolls) until they practice sufficiently to master it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When the physical change
occurs, there is a base 100% chance that the subject's personality
and mentality change into that of the new form (i.e., a roll of 20 or
less on 1d20). For each 1 point of Intelligence of the subject,
subtract 1 from the base chance on 1d20. Additionally, for every Hit
Die of difference between the original form and the form it is
assuming, add or subtract 1 (depending on whether polymorphed form
has more Hit Dice [or levels] or fewer Hit Dice [or levels] than
original, respectively). The chance for assumption of the personality
and mentality of the new form is checked daily until the change takes

spell or similar magic. Once this final change takes place, the
creature acquires the new form's full range of magical and special
abilities.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example: If a 1 Hit Die
orc of 8 Intelligence is polymorphed into a white dragon with 6 Hit

out of 20 = 85%) likely to actually become one in all respects, but
in any case it has the dragon's physical and mental capabilities. If
it does not assume the personality and mentality of a white dragon,
it knows what it formerly knew as well.</font></p>

change the polymorphed creature back to its original form, and this
requires a system shock roll. Those who have lost their individuality
and are then converted back maintain the belief that they are
actually the polymorphed creature and attempt to return to that form.
Thus, the orc who comes to believe he is a white dragon, when
converted back to his orc form, steadfastly maintains he is really a
white dragon polymorphed into the shape of an orc. His companions
will most likely consider him mad.</font></p>

wizard is able to assume the form of any creature, save those that
are noncorporeal, from as small as a wren to as large as a
hippopotamus. Furthermore, the wizard gains its physical mode of
locomotion and breathing as well. No system shock roll is required.
The spell does not give the new form's other abilities (attack,
magic, special movement, etc.), nor does it run the risk of the
wizard changing personality and mentality.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When the polymorph occurs,
the caster's equipment, if any, melds into the new form (in
particularly challenging campaigns, the DM may allow protective
devices, such as a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>ring
of protection,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> to
continue operating effectively). The caster retains all mental
abilities, including spell use, assuming the new form allows
completion of the proper verbal and somatic components and the
material components are available. A caster not used to a new form
might be penalized at the DM's option (for example, -2 penalty to
attack rolls) until he practices sufficiently to master it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thus, a wizard changed into
an owl could fly, but his vision would be human; a change to a black
pudding would enable movement under doors or along halls and
ceilings, but not the pudding's offensive (acid) or defensive
capabilities. Naturally, the strength of the new form is sufficient
to enable normal movement. The spellcaster can change his form as
often as desired for the duration of the spell, each change requiring
a round. The wizard retains his own hit points, attack rolls, and
saving throws. The wizard can end the spell at any time; when
voluntarily returning to his own form and ending the spell, he
regains 1d12 hit points. The wizard also will return to his own form
when slain or when the effect is dispelled, but no hit points are
restored in these cases.</font></p>

levels, or Hit Dice, of creatures--24 creatures with 1 Hit Die each,
12 with 2 Hit Dice, etc. All creatures affected must be within the
area of effect, and each is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. An
attack on an affected creature that causes damage frees it from the
spell immediately. Creatures that are restrained and removed from the
area still try to follow the pattern.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once the rainbow pattern is
cast, the wizard need only gesture in the direction he desires, and
the pattern of colors moves slowly off in that direction, at the rate
of 30 feet per round. It persists without further attention from the
spellcaster for 1d3 rounds. All affected creatures follow the moving
rainbow of light. If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous
area (through flame, off a cliff, etc.), allow a second saving throw.

monsters</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell uses
material from the Demiplane of Shadow to shape semireal illusions of
one or more monsters. The total Hit Dice of the shadow monster or
monsters thus created cannot exceed the level of experience of the
wizard; thus, a 10th-level wizard can create one creature that has 10
Hit Dice, two that have 5 Hit Dice, etc. All shadow monsters created
by one spell must be of the same sort. The actual hit point total for
each monster is 20% of the hit point total it would normally have.
(To determine this, roll the appropriate Hit Dice and multiply the
hit points by .2. Any remainder less than .4 is dropped--in the case
of monsters with 1 or fewer Hit Dice, this indicates the monster was
not successfully created--and scores between .4 and 1 are rounded up
to 1 hit point.)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Those viewing the shadow
monsters are allowed to disbelieve as per normal illusions, although
there is a -2 penalty to the attempt. The shadow monsters perform as
the real monsters with respect to Armor Class and attack forms. Those
who believe in the shadow monster suffer real damage from their
attacks. Special attack forms such as petrification or level drain do
not actually occur, but a subject who believes they are real will
react appropriately.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Those who roll successful
saving throws see the shadow monsters as transparent images
superimposed on vague shadowy forms. These are Armor Class 10 and
inflict only 20% of normal melee damage (biting, clawing, weapon,
etc.), dropping fractional damage less than .4 as done with hit
points.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example: A shadow monster
griffon attacks a person who knows it is only quasi-real. The monster
strikes with two claw attacks and one bite, hitting as a 7-Hit Die
monster. All three attacks hit; the normal damage dice are rolled,
multiplied by .2 separately, rounded up or down, and added together
to get the total damage. Thus, if the attacks score 4, 2 and 11
points, a total of 4 points of damage is inflicted (4 x .2 = .8
[rounded to 1], 2 x .2 = .4 [rounded to 1], 11 x .2 = 2.2 [rounded to
2]. The sum is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4).</font></p>

brings forth an immobile, blazing curtain of magical fire of
shimmering color--violet or reddish blue. The spell creates either an
opaque sheet of flame up to one 20-foot square per level of the

two levels of experience of the wizard. In either form, the wall of
fire is 20 feet high.</font></p>

2d4 points of damage upon creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of
damage upon those within 20 feet. In addition, the wall inflicts 2d6
points of damage, plus 1 point of damage per level of the
spellcaster, upon any creature passing through it. Creatures
especially subject to fire may take additional damage, and undead
always take twice normal damage. Note that attempting to catch a
moving creature with a newly-created wall of fire is difficult; a
successful saving throw enables the creature to avoid the wall, while
its rate and direction of movement determine which side of the
created wall it is on. The wall of fire lasts as long as the wizard

spell is cast, a sheet of strong, hard ice is created. The wall is
primarily defensive, stopping pursuers and the like. The wall is 1
inch thick per level of experience of the wizard. It covers a
10-foot-square area per level (a 10th-level wizard can create a wall
of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20
feet high, etc.). Any creature breaking through the ice suffers 2
points of damage per inch of thickness of the wall. Fire-using
creatures suffer 3 points of damage per inch, while cold-using
creatures suffer only 1 point of damage per inch when breaking
through. The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is
anchored along one or more sides.</font></p>

This casting of the spell creates a hemisphere whose maximum radius
is equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level. Thus, a 7th-level
caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. The hemisphere
lasts until it is broken, dispelled, or melted. Note that it is
possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents under the
hemisphere.</font></p>

of the spell causes a horizontal sheet to fall upon opponents. The

inflicted to creatures beneath it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A wall of ice cannot form in
an area occupied by physical objects or creatures; its surface must
be smooth and unbroken when created. Magical fires such as fireballs
and fiery dragon breath melt a wall of ice in one round, though this
creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts one turn. Normal fires
or lesser magical ones do not hasten the melting of a wall of ice.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When this spell is employed,
the wizard creates an invisible sensory organ that sends him visual
information. The wizard eye travels at 30 feet per round if viewing
an area ahead as a human would (i.e., primarily looking at the
floor), or 10 feet per round if examining the ceiling and walls as
well as the floor ahead. The wizard eye can see with infravision up
to 10 feet, and with normal vision up to 60 feet away in brightly lit
areas. The wizard eye can travel in any direction as long as the
spell lasts. It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>detect invisibility</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">

eye, although it can pass through a space no smaller than a small
mouse hole (1 inch in diameter).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Using the eye requires the
wizard to concentrate. However, if his concentration is broken, the
spell does not end--the eye merely becomes inert until the wizard
again concentrates, subject to the duration of the spell. The powers
of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is
subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful dispel cast
on the wizard or eye ends the spell. With respect to blindness,
magical darkness, and so on, the wizard eye is considered an
independent sensory organ of the caster.</font></p>

airy water, although intelligent ones can enter it if they are able

of the undead monsters--skeletons or zombies--usually from the bones
or bodies of dead humans, demihumans, or humanoids. The spell causes
existing remains to become animated and obey the simple verbal
commands of the caster. The skeletons or zombies can follow the
caster, remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific
type of creature) entering the place, etc. The undead remain animated
until they are destroyed in combat or are turned; the magic cannot be

attained, or one zombie for every two levels. The experience levels,

The number of undead animated is determined by the monster Hit Dice
(the total Hit Dice cannot exceed the wizard's level). Skeletal forms
have the Hit Dice of the original creature, while zombie forms have
one more Hit Die. Thus, a 12th-level wizard could animate four zombie
gnolls (4 x [2+1 Hit Dice] = 12), or a single fire giant skeleton.

wind breaks it up in four rounds, and a greater wind force prevents
the use of the spell. Very thick vegetation will disperse the cloud
in two rounds. As the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the
lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings;
thus, the spell is ideal for slaying nests of giant ants, for
example. It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast under water.</font></p>

spells in the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>conjure

The wizard is able to conjure an air, earth, fire, or water elemental
with this spell--assuming he has the material component for the
particular elemental. (A considerable fire source must be in range to
conjure a fire elemental; a large amount of water must be available
to conjure a water elemental.) Conjured elementals have 8 Hit Dice.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It is possible to conjure
successive elementals of different types if the spellcaster has
memorized two or more of these spells. The type of elemental to be
conjured must be decided upon before memorizing the spell. Each type
of elemental can be conjured only once per day.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The conjured elemental must
be controlled by the wizard--the spellcaster must concentrate on the
elemental doing his commands--or it turns on the wizard and attacks.
The elemental will not break off a combat to do so, but it will avoid
creatures while seeking its conjurer. If the wizard is wounded or
grappled, his concentration is broken. There is always a 5% chance
that the elemental turns on its conjurer regardless of concentration.
This check is made at the end of the second and each succeeding
round. An elemental that breaks free of its control can be dispelled
by the caster, but the chance of success is only 50%. The elemental
can be controlled up to 30 yards away per level of the spellcaster.
The elemental remains until its form on this plane is destroyed due
to damage or until the spell's duration expires. Note that water
elementals are destroyed if they are ever more than 60 yards from a
large body of water.</font></p>

wizard sends his mind to another plane of existence in order to
receive advice and information from powers there. As these powers
resent such contact, only brief answers are given. (The DM answers
all questions with &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; &quot;maybe,&quot;
&quot;never,&quot; &quot;irrelevant,&quot; etc.) Any questions asked
are answered by the power during the spell's duration. The character
can contact an elemental plane or some plane farther removed. For
every two levels of experience of the wizard, one question may be
asked. Contact with minds far removed from the plane of the wizard
increases the probability of the spellcaster going insane or dying,
but the chance of the power knowing the answer, as well as the
probability of the being telling the correct answer, are likewise
increased by moving to distant planes. Once the Outer Planes are
reached, the Intelligence of the power contacted determines the

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As the caster completes the
spell, the person sending the spell falls into a deep trancelike
sleep, and instantaneously projects his mind to the recipient. The
sender then enters the recipient's dream and delivers the message
unless the recipient is magically protected. If the recipient is
awake, the message sender can choose to remain in the trancelike
sleep. If the sender is disturbed during this time, the spell is
immediately cancelled and the sender comes out of the trance. The
whereabouts and current activities of the recipient cannot be learned
through this spell.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once the recipient's dreams
are entered, the sender can deliver a message of any length, which
the recipient remembers perfectly upon waking. The communication is
one-way; the recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor
can the sender gain any information by observing the dreams of the
recipient. Once the message is delivered, the sender's mind returns
instantly to his body. The duration of the spell is the time required
for the sender to enter the recipient's dream and deliver the
message.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This spell enables a
specially constructed chest to be hidden deep within the Ethereal
Plane, to be summoned using a small model of the chest. The large
chest must be exceptionally well-crafted and expensive, constructed
for the caster by master craftsmen. If made principally of wood, it
must be ebony, rosewood, sandalwood, teak, or the like, and all of
its corner fittings, nails, and hardware must be platinum. If
constructed of ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must be gold.
If the chest is fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, its
fittings must be electrum or silver. The cost of such a chest is
never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, the wizard must
have a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every
detail) made, so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a
perfect copy. One wizard can have but one pair of these chests at any
given time--even </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>wish</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spells do not allow exceptions! The chests themselves are nonmagical,
and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal
chest.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	While touching the chest and
holding the tiny replica, the caster chants the spell. This causes
the large chest to vanish into the Ethereal Plane. The chest can
contain 1 cubic foot of material per level of the wizard no matter
what its apparent size. Living matter makes it 75% likely that the
spell fails, so the chest is typically used for securing valuable
spell books, magical items, gems, etc. As long as the spellcaster has
the small duplicate of the magical chest, he can recall the large one
from the Ethereal Plane whenever the chest is desired. If the
miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not
even with a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>wish</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell, that the large chest can return, although an expedition might
be mounted to find it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	While the chest is in the
Ethereal Plane, there is a cumulative 1% chance per week that some
being finds it. This chance is reset to 1% whenever the chest is
recalled and the spell recast to return it to the Ethereal Plane. If
the chest is found, the DM must work out the encounter and decide how
the being reacts to the chest (for example, it might ignore the
chest, fully or partially empty it, or even exchange or add to the
items present!).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Whenever the secret chest is
brought back to the Prime Material Plane, an ethereal window is
opened for a variable amount of time (usually about one turn); the
window slowly diminishes in size. When this hole opens between the
planes, check for an ethereal encounter to see if a monster is drawn
through.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the large chest is not
retrieved before the spell duration lapses, there is a cumulative
chance of 5% per day that the chest is lost.</font></p>

or large crystal). From there the caster can force an exchange of
life forces between the receptacle and another creature, thus
enabling the wizard to take over and control the body of another
creature, while the life force of the host is confined in the
receptacle. The special life force receptacle must be within spell
range of the wizard's body at the time of spellcasting. The wizard's
life force shifts into the receptacle in the round in which the
casting is completed, allowing no other actions.</font></p>

caster can sense and attack any life force within a 10-foot-per-level
radius (on the same plane); however, the exact creature types and
relative physical positions cannot be determined. In a group of life
forces, the caster can sense a difference of four or more levels/Hit
Dice and can determine whether a life force is positive or negative
energy.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, if two
10th-level fighters are attacking a hill giant and four ogres, the

upon its real or acquired knowledge (i.e., the wizard does not
automatically know the language or spells of the creature). The
caster retains his own attack rolls, class knowledge and training,
and any adjustments due to his Intelligence or Wisdom. If the host
body is human or humanoid, and the necessary spell components are
available, the wizard can even use his memorized spells. The host
body retains its own hit points and physical abilities and
properties. The DM decides if any additional modifications are
necessary; for example, perhaps clumsiness or inefficiency occurs if
the caster must become used to the new form. The alignment of the
host or receptacle is that of the occupying life force.</font></p>

then command it to perform as guardian of a passage, room, door, or

loud barking if any creature larger than a cat approaches the place

subject only to magical weapons of +3 or greater. Creatures without
backs (for example, ochre jellies) are not attacked. The faithful
hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled. The spell lasts
for a maximum of one hour plus half an hour per caster level, but

the caster has no control over his facing upon arrival. Lesser known

can be used to seal off a passage or close a breach, for the wall
inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is
sufficient to do so. The wall of iron is ¼-inch thick per level of
experience of the spellcaster. The wizard is able to create an iron
wall of up to 15 square feet per experience level; thus, a 12th-level
wizard can create a wall of iron with an area of 180 square feet. The
wizard can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.</font></p>

modified by a force of not less than 30 Strength and 400 pounds
mass--each pound over 400 or Strength point over 30 alters the chance

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This spell creates a wall of
granite rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. It is
typically employed to close passages, portals, and breaches against
opponents. The wall of stone is 0.25 inch thick and up to 20 square
feet per level of experience of the wizard casting the spell. Thus, a
12th-level wizard can create a wall of stone 3 inches thick and up to
240 square feet in surface area (a 12-foot-wide and 20-foot-high
wall, for example, to completely close a 10-foot x 16-foot passage).
The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm
foundation (see the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>wall
of iron</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell);
however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing
stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp.
For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be
arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the area of effect by
half. Thus, a 20th-level caster can create a span with a surface area
of 200 square feet. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow
crenelations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the
area. The stone is permanent unless destroyed by a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>dispel

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By means of this spell, the
wizard surrounds himself with an invisible barrier that moves with
him. The space within this barrier is totally impervious to all magic
and magical spell effects, thus preventing the passage of spells or
their effects. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magical
items or spells within its confines. The area is also impervious to
breath weapons, gaze or voice attacks, and similar special attack
forms.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The antimagic shell also
hedges out charmed, summoned, or conjured creatures. It cannot,
however, be forced against any creature that it would keep at bay;
any attempt to do so creates a discernible pressure against the
barrier, and continued pressure will break the spell. Normal
creatures (a normally encountered troll rather than a conjured one,
for instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles.
Furthermore, while a magical sword does not function magically within
the area, it is still a sword. Note that creatures on their home
plane are normal creatures there. Thus, on the Elemental Plane of
Fire, a randomly encountered fire elemental cannot be kept at bay by
this spell. Artifacts, relics, and creatures of demigod or higher
status are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.</font></p>

that places itself between the spellcaster and a chosen opponent.
This disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two,
regardless of what the spellcaster does or how the opponent tries to
get around it. However, the forceful hand also pushes on the
opponent. This force can push away a creature weighing 500 pounds or
less, slow movement to 10 feet per round if the creature weighs

arcs to a series of other objects or creatures within range, losing

1d6 points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 12d6
(half damage if the object or creature rolls a successful saving
throw vs. spell). After the first strike, the lightning arcs to the
next nearest object or creature. Each jump reduces the strength of
the lightning by 1d6. Each creature or magical object hit receives a
saving throw vs. spell. Success on this save indicates the creature
suffers only half damage from the bolt.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The chain can strike as many
times (including the first object or creature) as the spellcaster has
levels, although each creature or object can be struck only once.
Thus, a bolt cast by a 12th-level wizard can strike up to 12 times,
causing less damage with each strike. The bolt continues to arc until
it has struck the appropriate number of objects or creatures, until
it strikes an object that grounds it (interconnecting iron bars of a
large cell or cage, a large pool of liquid, etc.), or until there are
no more objects or creatures to strike.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Direction is not a
consideration when plotting chain lightning arcs. Distance is a
factor--an arc cannot exceed the spell's range. If the only possible
arc is greater than the spell's range, the stroke fades into
nothingness. Creatures immune to electrical attack can be struck,
even though no damage is taken. Note that it is possible for the
chain to arc back to the caster!</font></p>

prepares the object to accept the magic. The item must meet the
following tests: 1) it must be in sound and undamaged condition; 2)
the item must be the finest possible, considering its nature, i.e.,
crafted of the highest quality material and with the finest
workmanship; and 3) its cost or value must reflect the second test,
and in most cases the item must have a raw-materials cost in excess
of 100 gp. With respect to requirement 3, it is not possible to apply
this test to items such as ropes, leather goods, cloth, and pottery
not normally embroidered, bejeweled, tooled, carved, or engraved. If
such work or materials can be added to an item without weakening or
harming its normal functions, however, these are required for the
item to be enchanted.</font></p>

to a workshop or laboratory, properly equipped and from which
contaminating magic can be screened. Any magical item not related to
the fabrication process (such as most protective devices) and within
30 feet of the materials is a source of contaminating magic and will
spoil the process.</font></p>

be touched by the spellcaster. This touching must be constant and
continual during the casting time, which is a base 16 hours plus an
additional 8d8 hours (as the wizard may never work more than eight
hours per day, and </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>haste</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
or any other spells will not alter the time required in any way, this
effectively means that casting time for this spell is two days + 1d8
days). All work must be uninterrupted, and during rest periods the
item being enchanted must never be more than 1 foot distant from the
spellcaster; if it is, the whole spell is spoiled and must be begun
again. (Note that during rest periods absolutely no other form of
magic can be performed, and the wizard must remain quiet and in
isolation or the enchantment is ruined.)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the end of the spell, the
caster will know that the item is ready for the final test. He will
then pronounce the final magical syllable, and if the item makes a
saving throw (which is exactly the same as that of the wizard) vs.
spell, the spell is completed. The spellcaster's saving throw bonuses
also apply to the item, up to +3. A result of 1 on the 1d20 roll
always results in failure, regardless of modifications. Once the
spell is finished, the wizard can begin to place the desired spell
upon the item. The spell he plans to place must be cast within 24
hours or the preparatory spell fades, and the item must be enchanted
again.</font></p>

requires 2d4 hours per spell level of the magic being cast. Again,
during casting the item must be touched by the wizard, and during the
rest periods it must always be within 1 foot of his person. This
procedure holds true for any additional spells placed upon the item,
and each successive spell must be begun within 24 hours of the last,
even if the prior spell failed.</font></p>

permanent unless a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>permanency</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell is used as a finishing touch. This always runs a 5% risk of
draining 1 point of Constitution from the wizard casting the spell.
Also, while it is possible to tell when the basic spell (</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>enchant
an item</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">) succeeds,
it is not possible to tell if successive castings actually work, for
each must make the same sort of saving throw as the item itself made.
Naturally, an item that is charged--a rod, staff, wand, </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>javelin
of lightning, ring of wishes,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
etc.--can never be made permanent. Magical devices cannot be used to
enchant an item or cast magic upon an object so prepared, but scrolls
can be used for this purpose.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The materials needed for this
spell vary according to both the nature of the item being enchanted
and the magic to be cast upon it. For example, a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>cloak
of displacement</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
might require the hides of one or more displacer beasts, a sword
meant to slay dragons could require the blood and some other part of
the type(s) of dragon(s) it will be effective against, and a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>ring
of shooting stars</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
might require pieces of meteorites and the horn of ki-rin. These
specifics, as well as other information pertaining to this spell, are
decided by the DM and must be discovered or researched in play.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Casting this spell attempts a
dangerous act: to lure a powerful creature from another plane to a
specifically prepared trap, where it will be held until it agrees to
perform one service in return for freedom from the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>ensnarement</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell. The type of creature to be ensnared must be known and stated,
and if it has a specific, proper, or given name, this must be used in
casting the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>ensnarement</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell. The spell causes an awareness of a gatelike opening on the
plane of the creature to be ensnared. A special saving throw is then
made to determine if the creature detects the nature of the planar
opening as a trap or believes it to be a gate. To save, the creature
must roll equal to or less than its Intelligence score on 1d20. The
score is modified by the difference between the creature's
Intelligence and that of the spellcaster. If the creature has a
higher score, the difference is subtracted from its dice roll to
save. If the spellcaster has a higher score, the difference is added
to the dice roll.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the saving throw succeeds,
the creature ignores the spell-created opening, and the spell fails.
If the saving throw fails, the creature steps into the opening and is
ensnared.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When so trapped, the
otherplanar creature can freely attack the ensnaring wizard, unless
the caster has created a warding circle. Such circles may be
temporary (drawn by hand) or permanent (inlaid or carved). Even with
such protection, the entrapped creature may break free and wreak its
vengeance upon the spellcaster.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A hand-drawn circle has a
base failure chance of 20%, while one inlaid or carved has a base of
10% (and that is for the first time it is used, to determine whether
or not the job was done properly). The base chance is modified by the
difference between the wizard's combined Intelligence and experience
level and the Intelligence and the experience level or Hit Dice of
the creature ensnared. If the spellcaster has a higher total, that
difference in percentage points is subtracted from the chance for the
creature to break free. If the creature has a higher total, that
difference is added to its chance to break free.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The chance can be further
reduced by careful preparation of the circle. If the hand-made circle
is drawn over a longer period of time, using specially prepared
pigments (1,000 gp value per turn spent drawing), the chance of
breaking free is reduced by 1% for every turn spent in preparation.
This can bring the base chance to 0%.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Similarly, an inlaid or
carved design can be brought to a 0% chance of the creature breaking
free by inlaying with various metals, minerals, etc. This cost will
require a minimum of one full month of time and add not less than
50,000 gp to the basic cost of having the circle inlaid or carved
into stone. Any break in the circle spoils the efficacy of the spell
and enables the creature to break free automatically. Even a straw
dropped across the line of a magic circle destroys its power.
Fortunately, the creature within cannot so much as place a straw upon
any portion of the inscribed ward, for the magic of the barrier
absolutely prevents it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once safely ensnared, the
creature can be kept for as long as the spellcaster dares. (Remember
the danger of something breaking the ward!) The creature cannot leave
the circle, nor can any of its attacks or powers penetrate the
barrier. The caster can offer bribes, use promises, or make threats
in order to exact one service from the captive creature.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM will then assign a
value to what the wizard has said to the ensnared creature, rating it
from 0 to 6 (with 6 being the most persuasive). This rating is then
subtracted from the Intelligence score of the creature. If the
creature rolls a successful Intelligence check against its adjusted
Intelligence, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, etc., can be
made, or the old ones re-offered 24 hours later, when the creature's
Intelligence has dropped by 1 point due to confinement. This can be
repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free,
or until the caster decides to get rid of it by means of some
riddance spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never
agreed to.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once the single service is
completed, the creature need only so inform the spellcaster to be
instantly sent from whence it came. The creature might later seek
revenge.</font></p>

spell enables the caster to merely meet the gaze of a creature and
speak a single word to cause an effect. This gaze attack is in
addition to any other attacks allowed to the wizard. The wizard
selects one of four possible gaze attacks at the time the spell is
cast, and this attack cannot be changed. For example, a 12th-level
caster who chose </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>fear</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
would have four opportunities to make gaze attacks causing fear, one
for each round of the spell's duration. Any gaze attack is negated by
a successful saving throw vs. spell, with Wisdom adjustments. The
four effects of the spell are as follows:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Charm:</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">

uttering a single word. The effect is to make the charmed subject
absolutely loyal and docile to the caster, even to the point of
personal danger. It is otherwise the same as a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>charm

The wizard can cause fear by gaze and by speaking a single word. The
subject flees in blind terror for 1d4 rounds. After this, the
creature refuses to face the caster and cowers or bolts for the
nearest cover if subsequently confronted by the caster (50% chance of
either). The latter effect lasts one turn per caster level. This
attack can be negated by spells that counter fear.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

cause sudden pain and fever to sweep over the subject's body.
Creatures with ability scores function at half effectiveness; others
inflict only one-half damage with physical attacks. Movement is at
one-half normal rate. The subject remains stricken for one turn per
level of the caster, after which all abilities return at the rate of
one point per turn of complete rest or one point per hour of moderate
activity. The effects cannot be negated by a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>cure

by means of a gaze and a single word, unless the subject successfully
rolls its saving throw vs. spell. Creatures normally subject to a

itself or perform acts that are likely to result in certain death, it
can cause almost any other course of action. The geased creature must
follow the given instructions until the geas is completed. Failure to
do so will cause the creature to grow sick and die within 1d4 weeks.

invisible stalker from the Elemental Plane of Air. This 8-Hit Dice
monster obeys and serves the spellcaster in performing whatever tasks
are set before it. It is a faultless tracker within one day of the
quarry's passing. The invisible stalker follows instructions even if
they send him hundreds or thousands of miles away and, once given an
order, follows through unceasingly until the task is accomplished.
However, the creature is bound to serve; it does not do so from
loyalty or desire. Therefore, it resents prolonged missions or
complex tasks, and it attempts to pervert instructions accordingly.
Invisible stalkers understand common speech but speak no language
save their own.</font></p>

to determine legendary information regarding a known person, place,
or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if the wizard is in
the place in question, the likelihood of the spell producing results
is far greater and the casting time is only 1d4 turns. If only
detailed information on the person, place, or thing is known, casting
time is 1d10 days. If only rumors are known, casting time is 2d6
weeks.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	During the casting, the
wizard cannot engage in activities other than the routine: eating,
sleeping, etc. When completed, the divination reveals if legendary
material is available. It often reveals where this material is--by
place name, rhyme, or riddle. It sometimes gives certain information
regarding the person, place, or thing (when the object of the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>legend
lore</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> is at hand),
but this data is always in some cryptic form (rhyme, riddle, anagram,
cipher, sign, etc.). Naturally, a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>legend

information only if the person, place, or thing is noteworthy or
legendary.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, suppose

spell, she could not learn any information. Even giving it to a
trusted fighter didn't work, as the sword did not reveal any special
powers. Finally, she casts a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>legend
lore</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell, hoping
to gain more information. Since the sword is at hand, she completes
the spell in three turns. In her mind comes the message, &quot;Once
this was the sword of he who waits till Albion's time of greatest
peril, when unto his hand it shall fly again. Fair was the hand that
gave me and fair was the hand that reclaimed me.&quot; Clearly,
Delsenora realizes, this must be a very powerful item, since her
spell gave only a cryptic answer. But who is he who waits? And where
is Albion? For more information, Delsenora is going to have to cast
more spells. But now the process will take much longer, since she has
only the vaguest of clues to follow.</font></p>

can be lowered up to 2 feet for every experience level of the wizard,
to a minimum depth of 1 inch. The water is lowered within a square

a 13th-level caster a volume of 26 feet x 130 feet x 130 feet, and so

the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft
downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by
normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water

melee, or if harmed by an attack.) If the caster actually uses a

damage), dine upon imaginary food and actually be satisfied, or rest
comfortably upon a bed of sharp stones, thinking it a featherbed.
Gravity is not affected by the spell, however, so an envisioned
bridge spanning a deep chasm does not support the believer. Those who
witness the event see it as a sudden disappearance of the individual.

are seen through. Polymorphed, changed, or enchanted objects are
apparent. (The real form appears translucently superimposed on the

human with a ghostly dragon looming over the human form.) Unlike the

alignment. The recipient can focus his vision to see into the

For example, if iron, holy water, sunstone, and a sprig of rosemary
were used in casting a banishment upon a being that hates those
things, its saving throw versus the spell would be made with a -8
penalty (four substances times the factor of -2). Special items, such
as hair from the tail of a ki-rin or couatl feathers, could also be
added to change the factor to -3 or -4 per item. In contrast, a
titan's hair or mistletoe blessed by a druid might lower the factor
to -1 with respect to the same creature. If the subject creature
successfully rolls its saving throw vs. spell, the caster is stung by
a backlash of energy, suffers 2d6 points of damage, and is stunned
for one round.</font></p>

caster knows who the possessor is and roughly where he, she, or it is
located when the summons is cast. Items can be summoned from other
planes of existence, but only if such items are not in the possession
(not necessarily the physical grasp) of another creature. For each
level of experience above the 14th, the wizard is able to summon a
desired item from one plane farther removed from the plane he is in
at the time the spell is cast (one plane away at 14th level, two
planes away at 15th, etc.). Thus, a wizard of 16th level could cast
the spell even if the desired item was on the second layer of one of
the Outer Planes, but at 14th level the wizard would be able to
summon the item only if it were no farther than one of the Inner
Planes, the Ethereal Plane, or the Astral Plane (see the Planescape</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This powerful spell enables
the caster to bring into being a cube of force, but it is unlike the
magical item of that name in one important respect: The forcecage
does not have solid walls of force; it has alternating bands of force
with ½-inch gaps between. Thus, it is truly a cage, rather than an
enclosed space with solid walls. Creatures within the area of effect
of the spell are caught and contained unless they are able to pass
through the openings--and, of course, all spells and breath weapons
can pass through the gaps in the bars of force of the forcecage.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A creature with magic
resistance has a single attempt to pass through the walls of the
cage. If the resistance check is successful, the creature escapes. If
it fails, the creature is caged. Note that a successful check does
not destroy the cage, nor does it enable other creatures (save
familiars) to flee with the escaping creature. The forcecage is also
unlike the solid-walled protective device, cube of force, in that it
can be gotten rid of only by means of a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>dispel
magic</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell or by
the expiration of the spell.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By means of special

spell can be altered to a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>forcecube</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell. The cube created is 10 feet on a side, and the spell then
resembles that of a cube of force in all respects save that of the
differences between a cast spell and the magic of a device, including
the methods of defeating its power.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although the actual casting
of either application of the spell requires no material component,
the study required to commit it to memory does demand that the wizard
powder a diamond of at least 1,000 gp value, using the diamond dust
to trace the outlines of the cage or cube he desires to create via
spellcasting at some later time. Thus, in memorization, the diamond
dust is employed and expended, for upon completion of study, the
wizard must then toss the dust into the air and it will disappear.</font></p>

wish</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> is a very
potent but difficult spell. It will fulfill literally, but only
partially or for a limited duration, the utterance of the
spellcaster. Thus, the actuality of the past, present, or future
might be altered (but possibly only for the wizard unless the wording
of the spell is most carefully stated) in some limited manner. The
use of a limited wish will not substantially change major realities,
nor will it bring wealth or experience merely by asking. The spell
can, for example, restore some hit points (or all hit points for a
limited duration) lost by the wizard. It can reduce opponent hit
probabilities or damage, increase duration of some magical effect,
cause a creature to be favorably disposed to the spellcaster, mimic a
spell of 7th level or less, and so on (see the 9th-level </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>wish</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell). Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher.
Casting time is based on the time spent preparing the wording for the
spell (clever players decide what they want to say before using the
spell). Normally, the casting time is one round (most of it being
taken up by deciding what to say). Casting this spell ages the caster
one year per 100 years of regular life span.</font></p>

can be gained only at a single point of space on the plane from which
the spell was cast. From the entry point, those creatures observing
the area see only a faint shimmering in the air, in an area 4 feet
wide and 8 feet high. The caster of the spell controls entry to the
mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind him when he
enters. He may open it again from his own side at will. Once
observers have passed beyond the entrance, they behold a magnificent
foyer and numerous chambers beyond. The place is furnished and
contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to as
many dozens of people as the spellcaster has levels of experience.
There is a staff of near-transparent servants, liveried and obedient,

is not. It seems excellent and quite filling as long as one is within
the place. Once outside, however, its effects disappear immediately,
and if those resting have not eaten real food within a reasonable

immediately results in the onset of fatigue or starvation penalties

Mordenkainen's sword to hit is the same as the chance for a sword
wielded by a fighter of half the level of the spellcaster. For

spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature, usually from
another plane of existence. Extraplanar creatures must be confined by
a circular diagram; other creatures can be physically confined. The
duration of the spell depends upon the form of the binding and the
level of the caster(s), as well as the length of time the spell is
actually uttered. The components vary according to the form of the
spell, but they include a continuous chanting utterance read from the
scroll or book page giving the spell; gestures appropriate to the
form of binding; and materials such as miniature chains of special
metal (silver for lycanthropes, etc.), soporific herbs of the rarest
sort, a corundum or diamond gem of great size (1,000 gp value per Hit
Die of the subject creature), and a vellum depiction or carved
statuette of the subject to be captured.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Magic resistance applies
unless the subject's true name is used. A saving throw is not
applicable as long as the experience level of the caster is at least
twice as great as the Hit Dice of the subject. The caster's level can
be augmented by one-third of the levels of each assisting wizard of
9th level or higher, and by one level for each assistant of 4th
through 8th level. No more than six other wizards can assist with
this spell. If the caster's level is less than twice the Hit Dice of
the subject, the subject gains a saving throw vs. spell, modified by
the form of binding being attempted. The various forms of binding
are:</font></p>

spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except the
caster. Duration is as long as one year per level of the caster(s).
The subject of this form of binding (as well as in the slumber and
bound slumber versions) remains within the restraining barrier.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The subject of the chaining
form of the spell receives a saving throw with no modifications.
However, slumber allows the subject a +1 bonus, bound slumber a +2
bonus, hedged prison a +3 bonus, metamorphosis a +4 bonus, and
minimus containment a +5 bonus to the saving throw. If the subject is
magically weakened, the DM can assign a -1, -2, or even -4 penalty to
the saving throw. A successful saving throw enables the subject to
burst its bonds and do as it pleases.</font></p>

spell, for the subject does not have the opportunity to break the
bonds. (If anything has caused a weakening of a chaining or slumber
version, such as attempts to contact the subject or magically touch
it, a normal saving throw applies to the renewal of the spell.)
Otherwise, after one year, and each year thereafter, the subject
gains a normal saving throw vs. the spell. Whenever it is successful,

telekinetically lifted in the sphere by the caster. Range of control
extends to a maximum distance of 10 yards per level after the sphere
has actually succeeded in encapsulating a subject or subjects. Note
that even if more than 5,000 pounds of weight is englobed, the
perceived weight is only 1/16 of the actual weight, so the orb can be
rolled without exceptional effort. Because of the reduced weight,
rapid motion or falling within the field of the sphere is relatively
harmless to the object therein, although it can be disastrous should
the globe disappear when the subject inside is high above a hard
surface. The caster can dismiss the effect with a word.</font></p>

simply treat the spell as a more powerful version, with saving throws

radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted

changes by using the following guidelines:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>	Kingdom</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">		Animal,
vegetable, mineral</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>	Class</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">		Mammals,

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>	Size</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">			Smaller,
equal, larger</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>	Shape</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">		Comparative
resemblance of the original to the polymorphed state</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>	Intelligence</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">		Particularly
with regard to a change in which the end product is more intelligent</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A change in </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>kingdom</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
makes the spell work for hours (if removed by one kingdom) or turns
(if removed by two). Other changes likewise affect spell duration.
Thus, changing a lion to an androsphinx would be permanent, but
turning a turnip to a purple worm would be a change with a duration
measured in hours. Turning a tusk into an elephant would be
permanent, but turning a twig into a sword would be a change with a
duration of several turns.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All polymorphed objects
radiate a strong magic, and if a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>dispel
magic</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell is
successfully cast upon them, they return to their natural form. Note
that a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>stone to
flesh</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell or its
reverse will affect objects under this spell. As with other polymorph
spells, damage sustained in the new form can result in the injury or
death of the polymorphed creature.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, it is possible
to polymorph a creature into rock and grind it to dust, causing
damage, perhaps even death. If the creature was changed to dust to
start with, more creative methods to damage it would be needed;
perhaps the wizard could use a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>gust
of wind</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell to
scatter the dust far and wide. In general, damage occurs when the new
form is altered through physical force, although the DM will have to
adjudicate many of these situations.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The system shock roll must be
applied to living creatures, as must the restrictions noted regarding
the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>polymorph other</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
and </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>stone to flesh</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spells. Also note that a polymorph effect often detracts from an
item's or creature's powers, but does not add new powers, except
possibly movement capabilities not present in the old form. Thus, a
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>vorpal sword</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
polymorphed into a dagger would not retain vorpal capability.
Likewise, valueless items cannot be made into permanent valuable
items.</font></p>

this spell are mercury, gum arabic, and smoke.</font></p>

sightless. The spellcaster selects one creature as the target center,

hit points of creatures; creatures who currently have 100 or more hit
points are not affected and do not count against the number of
creatures affected. The duration of the spell depends upon how many
hit points are affected. If 25 or fewer hit points are affected, the
blindness is permanent until cured. If 26 to 50 hit points are
affected, the blindness lasts for 1d4+1 turns. If 51 to 100 hit

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This spell combines several
elements to create a powerful protection from scrying and direct
observation. When the spell is cast, the wizard dictates what will
and will not be observed in the area of effect. The illusion created
must be stated in general terms. Thus, the caster could specify the
illusion of him and another playing chess for the duration of the
spell, but he could not have the illusionary chess players take a
break, make dinner, and then resume their game. He could have a
crossroads appear quiet and empty even while an army is actually
passing through the area. He could specify that no one be seen
(including passing strangers), that his troops be undetected, or even
that every fifth man or unit should be visible. Once the conditions
are set, they cannot be changed.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Attempts to scry the area
automatically detect the image stated by the caster with no saving
throw allowed. Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion
created. A band of men standing in a meadow could be concealed as an
empty meadow with birds chirping, etc. Direct observation may allow a
saving throw (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to
disbelieve what is seen. Certainly onlookers in the area would become
suspicious if the column of a marching army disappeared at one point
to reappear at another! Even entering the area does not cancel the
illusion or necessarily allow a saving throw, assuming the hidden
beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the
illusion.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By means of this spell, a
wizard can force a creature or object into the very earth or floor
upon which it stands. When casting the spell, the wizard must chant
the spell for the remainder of the round without interruption. At
that juncture, the subject creature or object becomes rooted to the
spot unless a saving throw vs. spell (for a creature) or
disintegration (for an object with magical properties) is successful.
(Note: &quot;magical properties&quot; include those of magical items
as listed in the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Dungeon
Master Guide,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> those
of items enchanted or otherwise of magical origin, and those of items
with protection-type spells or with permanent magical properties or
similar spells upon them.) Items of a nonmagical nature are not
entitled to a saving throw. If a subject fails its saving throw, it
becomes of slightly greater density than the surface upon which it
stands.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The spellcaster now has the
option of ceasing his spell and leaving the subject as it is, in
which case the spell expires in four turns, and the subject returns
to normal. If the caster proceeds with the spell (into the next
round), the subject begins to sink slowly into the ground. Before any
actions are taken in the new round, the subject sinks one-quarter of
its height; after the first group acts, another quarter; after the
second group acts, another; and at the end of the round, the victim
is totally sunken into the ground.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This entombment places a
creature or object in a state of suspended animation. The cessation
of time means that the subject does not grow older. Bodily and other
functions virtually cease, but the subject is otherwise unharmed. The
subject exists in undamaged form in the surface into which it was
sunk, its upper point as far beneath the surface as the subject has
height--a 6-foot-tall victim will be 6 feet beneath the surface,
while a 60-foot-tall subject will have its uppermost point 60 feet
below ground level. If the ground around the subject is somehow
removed, the spell is broken and the subject returns to normal, but
it does not rise up. Spells such as </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>dig,
transmute rock to mud,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
and </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>freedom</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
(the reverse of the 9th-level spell </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>imprisonment</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">)

in recovering it. If a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>detect

over an area upon which a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>sink</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell was used, it reveals a faint magical aura of undefinable
nature, even if the subject is beyond detection range. If the subject
is within range of the detection, the spell's schools can be
discovered (alteration and enchantment).</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The spell can be triggered in
one of two ways. First, the final word of the spell can be spoken
when the creature is within spell range. This allows magic resistance
(if any) and a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the

ignored and the saving throw vs. spell suffers a penalty of -2. If
the saving throw is successful, the prison gem shatters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The second method is far more
insidious, for it tricks the victim into accepting a trigger object
inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the
creature's soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature's
true name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger item
when the gem is enchanted. A </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>sympathy</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell can also be placed on the trigger item. As soon as the subject
creature picks up or accepts the trigger item, its life force is
automatically transferred to the gem, without the benefit of magic
resistance or saving throw.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The gem prison will hold the
trapped entity indefinitely, or until the gem is broken and the life
force is released, allowing the material body to reform. If the
trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane (which
could mean a character trapped by an inhabitant of another plane when
the character is not on the Prime Material Plane), it can be required
to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the
creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.</font></p>

the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>trap the soul</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell, the wizard must prepare the prison, a gem of at least 1,000 gp
value for every Hit Die or level of experience possessed by the
creature to be trapped (for example, it requires a gem of 10,000 gp
value to trap a 10 Hit Die or 10th-level creature). If the gem is not
valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted. (Note
that while characters have no concept of level as such, the value of
the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that
this value can change over time as characters advance.) Creating the
prison gem requires an </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>enchant
an item</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell and
the placement of a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>maze</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">

force.</font></p>

project his astral body into the Astral Plane, leaving his physical
body and material possessions behind in the Prime Material Plane.
Only magical items can be brought into the Astral Plane (although
nonmagical items could be rendered temporarily magical through the
use of some spells, if the DM allows). As the Astral Plane touches
upon the first levels of all of the Outer Planes, the wizard can
travel astrally to any of the Outer Planes at will. The caster then
leaves the Astral Plane, forming a body in the plane of existence he
has chosen to enter. It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere
in the Prime Material Plane by means of the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>astral

a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures in the

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At all times, the astral body
is connected to the material body by a silvery cord. If the cord is
broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially;
however, normally only a psychic wind can cause the cord to break.
When a second body is formed in a different plane, the silvery cord
remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the astral form is
slain, the cord simply returns to the original body where it rests in
the Prime Material Plane, reviving it from its state of suspended
animation.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although astrally projected
persons are able to function in the Astral Plane, their actions do
not affect creatures not existing in the Astral Plane. The spell

by some outside means (such as a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>dispel

spells. The crushing hand is under the mental control of the caster,
and he can cause it to grasp and squeeze an opponent. No attack roll
is necessary; the hand automatically grasps and inflicts constriction
damage in any round in which the wizard concentrates. The damage
inflicted depends on the number of rounds it acts upon the victim:</font></p>

Armor class of 0, has as many hit points as its caster at full
strength, and vanishes when destroyed. The hand is susceptible to
normal combat attacks and damaging spells, but if it is struck by an
area-effect spell, the person held suffers the same fate as the hand
(i.e., if the hand fails its saving throw, the victim automatically
fails his). The hand is not effective against noncorporeal or gaseous
forms, but it does prevent creatures that are able to slip through
small cracks from escaping. If the hand grasps an item or
construction, the appropriate saving throw must be made as if
squeezed by a Strength of 25.</font></p>

touch the item; if it is an opponent or something an opponent is

successful attack roll. Any single metal item can be affected by the
spell. Thus, a suit of armor worn by a creature can be changed to
crystal, but the creature's shield would not be affected, and vice
versa. All items gain a saving throw equal to their magical bonus
value or protection (the DM has this information). A +1/+3 sword
would get a 10% (average of the two pluses) chance to save; +5
magical armor has a 25% chance to be unaffected; an iron golem has a
15% chance to save (for it is hit only by magical weapons of +3 or
better quality). Artifacts and relics constructed of metal may be
affected at the discretion of the DM, though it is highly unlikely.
Affected items not immediately protected are shattered and
permanently destroyed if struck by a normal blow from a metal tool or

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This spell grants the caster
a powerful sixth sense in relation to himself or another. Although
cast upon himself, the wizard can specify that he or another is the
beneficiary of the spell. Once the spell is cast, the wizard receives
instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the object of
the spell. Thus, if he were the object of the spell, the wizard would
be warned in advance if a thief were about to attempt to backstab
him, or if a creature were about to leap out from an unexpected
direction, or if an attacker were specifically targeting him with a
spell or missile weapon. When the warnings are about him personally,
the wizard cannot be surprised and always knows the direction from
which any attack on him is made. In addition, the spell gives the
wizard a general idea of what action he might take to best protect
himself--duck, jump right, close his eyes, etc.--and gives him a
defensive bonus of 2 to his Armor Class.</font></p>

spell has two effects. First, it causes an interdimensional
connection between the plane of existence the wizard is on and the
plane on which dwells a specific being of great power; thus, the
being is able to merely step through the gate or portal from its
plane to that of the caster. Second, the utterance of the spell
attracts the attention of the sought-after dweller on the other
plane. When casting the spell, the wizard must name the entity he
desires to use the gate and come to the wizard's aid. There is a 100%
certainty that something steps through the gate. Unless the DM has
some facts prepared regarding the minions serving the being called
forth by the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>gate</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell, the being itself comes.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the matter is trifling,
the being might leave, inflict an appropriate penalty on the wizard,
or attack the wizard. If the matter is of middling importance, the
being can take some positive action to set matters right, then demand
appropriate repayment. If the matter is urgent, the being can act
accordingly and ask whatever is its wont thereafter, if appropriate.
The actions of the being that comes through depend on many factors,
including the alignments of the wizard and the deity, the nature of
his companions, and who or what opposes or threatens the wizard. Such
beings generally avoid direct conflict with their equals or betters.
The being gated in will either return immediately (very unlikely) or
remain to take action. Casting this spell ages the wizard five years.</font></p>

imprisonment at the same time.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Note: The exact details of
any creatures freed are up to the DM. A random method of determining
this is to roll percentile dice twice (once for imprisoned creature
density and once for a base number of creatures at maximum density).
The rolls are multiplied and rounded to the nearest whole number.
Each released creature has a 10% chance to be in the area of the
spellcaster. If monsters are being generated randomly, roll 1d20 for
level, with rolls of 9+ considered 9, and the exact monsters
determined by the random encounter tables.</font></p>

rolls were 22 and 60, the number of monsters released is .22 x .60 =

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This spell enables the wizard
to conjure up an immobile, opaque globe of shimmering, multicolored
light to surround him, giving protection from all forms of attack.
The sphere flashes in all colors of the visible spectrum, seven of
which have distinct powers and purposes. Any creature with fewer than
8 Hit Dice is blinded for 2d4 turns by the colors of the sphere. Only
the spellcaster can pass in and out of the prismatic sphere without
harm, though he can cast it over others to protect them. The sphere
can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by various
magical effects; however, the first must be brought down before the
second can be affected, and so on. Any creature passing through the
barrier receives the effect of every color still remaining. The
following table shows the colors and effects of the prismatic sphere,
as well as what will negate each globe.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Note that typically the upper
hemisphere of the globe is visible, as the spellcaster is at the
center of the sphere, so the lower half is usually hidden by the
floor surface he is standing on.</font></p>

will destroy a prismatic sphere (but an antimagic shell will fail to
penetrate it). Otherwise, anything short of an artifact or relic
entering the sphere is destroyed, and any creature is subject to the
effects of every color still active--i.e., 70-140 points of damage
plus death, petrification, insanity, and instantaneous transportation
to another plane.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With this spell, a wizard is
able to assume the form of any living thing or creature below demigod
status (greater or lesser deity, singular dragon type, or the like).
The spellcaster becomes the creature he wishes, and has all of its
abilities save those dependent upon Intelligence, innate magical
abilities, and magic resistance, for the mind of the creature is that
of the spellcaster. Thus, he can change into a griffon and fly away,
then to an efreet and fly through a roaring flame, then to a titan to
lift up a wagon, etc. These creatures have whatever hit points the
wizard had at the time of the shape change. Each alteration in form
requires only a second, and no system shock is incurred.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, a wizard is in
combat and assumes the form of a will o' wisp. When this form is no
longer useful, the wizard changes into a stone golem and walks away.
When pursued, the golem-shape is changed to that of a flea, which
hides on a horse until it can hop off and become a bush. If detected
as the latter, the wizard can become a dragon, an ant, or just about
anything he is familiar with.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A wizard adopting another
form also adopts its vulnerabilities. For example, a wizard who
becomes a spectre is powerless in daylight, and is subject to being
turned, controlled, or destroyed by opposing clerics. Unlike similar
spells, a wizard who is killed in another form does not revert to his
original shape, which may disallow certain types of revivification.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The material component is a
jade circlet worth no less than 5,000 gp, which shatters at the end
of the spell's duration. In the meantime, the circlet is left in the
wake of the shape change, and premature shattering ends the spell
immediately.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By casting this spell, the
wizard creates a powerful magic in some specially prepared object--a
statuette, a jeweled rod, a gem, etc. This object radiates magic, for
it contains the power to instantaneously transport its possessor to
the abode of the wizard who created it. Once the item is enchanted,
the wizard must give it willingly to an individual, at the same time
informing him of a command word to be spoken when the item is to be
used. To make use of the item, the recipient must speak the command
word at the same time that he rends or breaks the item. When this is
done, the individual and all that he is wearing and carrying are
instantly transported to the abode of the wizard. No other creatures
can be affected.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The reversed application of
the spell transports the wizard to the immediate vicinity of the
possessor of the enchanted item, when it is broken and the command
word spoken. The wizard will have a general idea of the location and
situation of the item possessor, but has no choice whether or not to
go (making this a rare casting indeed!).</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The material components used
include gemstones totaling not less than 5,000 gp value (whether they
are faceted gems or not is immaterial). The components can be
enchanted only once per month (usually on a night of a clear, full
moon). At that time, the object is set for the type of succor and its
final destination (either the location of the spellcasting or an area
well known to the wizard).</font></p>

wizard causes the flow of time to stop for one round in the area of
effect. Outside this area the sphere simply seems to shimmer for an
instant. Inside the sphere, the caster is free to act for 1d3 rounds
of apparent time. The wizard can move and act freely within the area
where time is stopped, but all other creatures, except for those of
demigod and greater status or unique creatures, are frozen in their
actions, for they are literally between ticks of the time clock. (The
spell duration is subjective to the caster.) Nothing can enter the
area of effect without being stopped in time also. If the wizard
leaves the area, the spell is immediately negated. When the spell
duration ceases, the wizard is again operating in normal time.</font></p>

affected by it with phantasmal images of their most feared enemies,
forcing an imaginary combat that seems real, but actually occurs in
the blink of an eye. When this spell is cast, the wizard must be able
to converse with the victims to bring the spell into being. During
the casting, the wizard must call out to the creatures to be
affected, informing one or all that their final fate, indeed their
doom, is now upon them.</font></p>

such that even if the creatures make their saving throws vs. spell,
fear will paralyze them for a full round, and they will lose 1d4
Strength points from this fear (the lost Strength will return in one
turn). Failure to save vs. spell causes the creature or creatures to
face their nemeses, the opponents most feared and inimical to them.
Actual combat must then take place, for no magical means of escape is
possible. The foe fought is real for all intents and purposes;
affected creatures that lose will die. If a creature's phantasmal
nemesis from the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>weird</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">

to another, it will not cause the wizard any disability. Other forms
of wishes, however, cause the spellcaster to weaken (-3 on Strength)

simple pits, deadfalls, snares of wilderness creatures (for example,
trapdoor spiders, giant sundews, ant lions, etc.), and primitive
traps constructed of natural materials (mantraps, missile trips,
hunting snares, etc.). The spell is directional--the caster must face
the desired direction to determine if a pit exists or a trap is laid
in that direction. The caster experiences a feeling of danger from
the direction of a detected hazard, which increases as the danger is
approached. The caster learns the general nature of the danger (pit,
snare, or deadfall) but not its exact operation, nor how to disarm
it. Close examination, however, enables the caster to sense what
intended actions might trigger it. The spell detects certain natural
hazards--quicksand (snare), sinkholes (pit), or unsafe walls of
natural rock (deadfall). Other hazards, such as a cavern that floods
during rain, an unsafe construction, or a naturally poisonous plant,

opponents gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls in darkness (including
moonlit nights) and a +1 bonus in twilight or better. Note that
outlining can render otherwise invisible creatures visible. However,
it cannot outline noncorporeal, ethereal, or gaseous creatures. Nor
does the light come anywhere close to sunlight. Therefore, it has no
special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures. The faerie fire
can be blue, green, or violet according to the word of the caster at

caused is equal in brightness to torchlight. Objects in darkness
beyond this sphere can be seen, at best, as vague and shadowy shapes.
The spell is centered on a point selected by the caster, and he must
have a line of sight or unobstructed path to that point when the

almost any similar substance. The effect is immobile unless it is
specifically centered on a movable object or mobile creature. If this
spell is cast upon a creature, any applicable magic resistance and
saving throws must be rolled. Successful resistance negates the
spell, while a successful saving throw indicates that the spell is

lasts one round per level of experience of the caster, while the

evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature

bonus.</font></p>

exercise mental control over the protected creature (if, for example,
it has been charmed by a vampire) or to invade and take over its mind
(as by a ghost's magic jar attack) is blocked by this spell. Note
that the protection does not prevent a vampire's charm itself, nor
end it, but it does prevent the vampire from exercising mental
control through the barrier. Likewise, an outside life force is
merely kept out, and would not be expelled if in place before the
protection was cast.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Third, the spell prevents
bodily contact by creatures of an extraplanar or conjured nature
(such as aerial servants, elementals, imps, invisible stalkers,
salamanders, water weirds, xorn, and others). This causes the natural
(body) weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creature to
recoil if such attacks require touching the protected creature.
Animals or monsters summoned or conjured by spells or similar magic
are likewise hedged from the character. This protection ends if the
protected character makes a melee attack against or tries to force
the barrier against the blocked creature.</font></p>

person or mammal it is cast upon. The creature then regards the
caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The
term </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>person</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
includes any bipedal human, demihuman or humanoid of man size or
smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes,
goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans,
kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and
others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter is included, while an ogre is not.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The spell does not enable the
caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton,
but any word or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable
way. Thus, a charmed creature would not obey a suicide command, but
might believe the caster if assured that the only chance to save the
caster's life is for the creature to hold back an onrushing red
dragon for &quot;just a minute or two&quot; and if the charmed
creature's view of the situation suggests that this course of action
still allows a reasonable chance of survival.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The subject's attitudes and
priorities are changed with respect to the caster, but basic
personality and alignment are not. A request that a victim make
itself defenseless, give up a valued item, or even use a charge from
a valued item (especially against former associates or allies) might
allow an immediate saving throw to see if the charm is thrown off.
Likewise, a charmed creature does not necessarily reveal everything
it knows or draw maps of entire areas. Any request may be refused, if
such refusal is in character and does not directly harm the caster.
The victim's regard for the caster does not necessarily extend to the
caster's friends or allies. The victim does not react well to the
charmer's allies making suggestions such as, &quot;Ask him this
question. . .,&quot; nor does the charmed creature put up with verbal
or physical abuse from the charmer's associates, if this is out of
character.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Note also that the spell does
not empower the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those he
normally has. The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed
creature's Intelligence, and it is tied to the saving throw. A
successful saving throw breaks the spell. This saving throw is
checked on a periodic basis according to the creature's Intelligence,
even if the caster has not overly strained the relationship.</font></p>

foot in diameter at its base, 5 feet tall, and 3 to 4 feet across at

ever separated from the caster by more than 30 yards. Its winds are
sufficient to put out torches, small campfires, exposed lanterns, and
other small, open flames of nonmagical origin. The dust devil can
hold a gas cloud or a creature in gaseous form at bay or push it away
from the caster (though it cannot damage or disperse such a cloud).
If skimming along the ground in an area of loose dust, sand, or ash,
the dust devil picks up those particles and disperses them in a
10-foot-diameter cloud centered on itself. The cloud obscures normal
vision, and creatures caught within are blinded while inside and for
one round after they emerge. A spellcaster caught in the dust devil
or its cloud while casting must make a saving throw vs. spell to keep
his concentration, or the spell is ruined. Any creature native to the

traps--concealed normally or magically--of magical or mechanical
nature become apparent to him. Note that this spell is directional,
and the caster must face the desired direction in order to determine
if a trap is laid in that particular direction.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A trap is any device or
magical ward that meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden or
unexpected result, the spellcaster would view the result as
undesirable or harmful, and the harmful or undesirable result was
specifically intended as such by the creator. Thus, traps include
alarms, glyphs, and similar spells or devices.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The caster learns the general
nature of the trap (magical or mechanical) but not its exact effect,
nor how to disarm it. Close examination will, however, enable the
caster to sense what intended actions might trigger it. Note that the
caster's divination is limited to his knowledge of what might be
unexpected and harmful. The spell cannot predict actions of creatures
(hence, a concealed murder hole or ambush is not a trap), nor are
natural hazards considered traps (a cavern that floods during a rain,
a wall weakened by age, a naturally poisonous plant, etc.). If the DM
is using specific glyphs or sigils to identify magical wards (see the
3rd-level spell </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>glyph
of warding</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">), this
spell shows the form of the glyph or mark. The spell does not detect
traps that have been disarmed or are otherwise inactive.</font></p>

traps, a thief has only half his normal find traps score to detect a
fire trap. Failure to remove it successfully detonates it

causes a blazing ray of red-hot fire to spring forth from his hand.
This bladelike ray is wielded as if it were a scimitar. If the caster
successfully hits with the flame blade in melee combat, the creature
struck suffers 1d4+4 points of damage, with a damage bonus of +2 (i.
e., 7-10 points) if the creature is undead or is especially
vulnerable to fire. If the creature is protected from fire, the
damage inflicted is reduced by 2 (i.e., 1d4+2 points). Fire dwellers
and those using fire as an innate attack form suffer no damage from
the spell. The flame blade can ignite combustible materials such as
parchment, straw, dry sticks, cloth, etc. However, it is not a
magical weapon in the normal sense of the term, so creatures (other
than undead) struck only by magical weapons are not harmed by it.

vapor to arise around the caster. It persists in this locale for four
rounds per caster level and reduces the visibility ranges of all

missile, with a range of 40 yards (considered short range). The flame
flashes on impact, igniting combustibles within a 3-foot diameter of
its center of impact, and then it goes out. A creature struck by the
flame suffers 1d4+1 points of damage and, if combustion occurs, must
spend a round extinguishing the fire or suffer additional damage
assigned by the DM until the fire is extinguished. A miss is resolved

upon a creature by a priest, the creature's body is toughened to
withstand heat or cold, as chosen by the caster. The spell grants the
creature complete immunity to mild conditions (standing naked in the
snow or reaching into an ordinary fire to pluck out a note). The
recipient can somewhat resist intense heat or cold (whether natural
or magical in origin), such as red-hot charcoal, a large amount of
burning oil, flaming swords, fire storms, fireballs, meteor swarms,
red dragon's breath, frostbrand swords, ice storms, </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>wands

dragon's breath. In all of these cases, the temperature affects the
creature to some extent. The recipient of the spell gains a bonus of
+3 to saving throws against such attack forms and all damage
sustained is reduced by 50%; therefore, if the saving throw is
failed, the creature sustains one-half damage, and if the saving
throw is successful, the creature sustains only one-quarter damage.

Conversation is impossible, spells cannot be cast (or at least not

stationary unless cast on a mobile object or creature. The spell
lasts two rounds for each level of experience of the priest. The
spell can be centered upon a creature, and the effect then radiates
from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature
receives a saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw is

if the snakes are not torpid, but are not aroused and angry, the
charm lasts 1d3 turns; if the snakes are angry or attacking, the
spell lasts 1d4+4 rounds. The priest casting the spell can charm
snakes whose total hit points are less than or equal to those of the
priest. On the average, a 1st-level priest could charm snakes with a
total of 4 or 5 hit points; a 2nd-level priest could charm 9 hit
points, etc. The hit points can be those of a single snake or those
of several of the reptiles, but the total hit points cannot exceed
those of the priest casting the spell. A 23-hit point caster charming
a dozen 2-hit point snakes would charm 11 of them. This spell is also

as the caster concentrates upon the hammer, it strikes at any
opponent within its range, as desired. Each round the caster can
choose to attack the same target as the previous round or switch to a
new target that he can see anywhere within his maximum range. The
spiritual hammer's chance to successfully hit is equal to that of the
caster, without any Strength bonuses. In addition, it strikes as a
magical weapon with a bonus of +1 for every six experience levels (or
fraction) of the spellcaster, up to a total of +3 to the attack roll
and +3 to the damage roll for a 13th-level caster. The base damage
inflicted when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war
hammer (1d4+1 points on opponents of man size or smaller, or 1d4
points on larger opponents, plus the magical bonus). The hammer
strikes in the same direction as the caster is facing, so if he is
behind the target, all bonuses for rear attack are gained along with

similar object. The spell causes the object to rise slightly off the
ground or floor it is resting on to trip most creatures crossing it,
if they fail their saving throws vs. spell. Note that only as many
creatures can be tripped as are actually stepping across the
enchanted object. Thus, a 3-foot-long piece of rope could trip only
one man-sized creature. Creatures moving at a very rapid pace
(running) when tripped suffer 1 point of damage and are stunned for
1d4+1 rounds if the surface they fall upon is very hard (if it is
turf or other soft material, they are merely stunned for the rest of
that round). Very large creatures, such as elephants, are not

saving throw roll when crossing the object. The enchanted object is
80% undetectable unless a means that detects magical traps is
employed or the operation of the spell is observed. This spell does

watch</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> because of
the insubstantial haze brought forth by its casting, which vaguely
resembles a wyvern. It is typically used to guard some area against
intrusion. Any creature approaching within 10 feet of the guarded
area may be affected by the &quot;wyvern.&quot; Any creature entering
the guarded area must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or
stand paralyzed for one round per level of the caster, until freed by
the spellcaster, by a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>dispel
magic</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell, or by
a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>remove paralysis</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell. A successful saving throw indicates that the subject creature
was missed by the attack of the wyvern-form, and the spell remains in
place. As soon as a subject creature is successfully struck by the
wyvern-form, the paralysis takes effect and the force of the spell
dissipates. The spell force likewise dissipates if no intruder is
struck by the wyvern-form for eight hours after the spell is cast.
Any creature approaching the space being guarded by the wyvern-form
may be able to detect its presence before coming close enough to be
attacked; this chance of detection is 90% in bright light, 30% in
twilight conditions, and 0% in darkness.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This spell creates the lowest
of the undead monsters, skeletons or zombies, usually from the bones
or bodies of dead humans, demihumans, or humanoids. The spell causes
these remains to become animated and obey the simple verbal commands
of the caster, regardless of how they communicated in life. The
skeletons or zombies can follow the caster, remain in an area and
attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering
the place, etc. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed
in combat or are turned; the magic cannot be dispelled.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The priest can animate one
skeleton or one zombie for each experience level he has attained. If
creatures with more than 1+ Hit Dice are animated, the number is
determined by the monster Hit Dice. Skeletal forms have the Hit Dice
of the original creature, while zombie forms have 1 more Hit Die.
Thus, a 12th-level priest could animate 12 dwarven skeletons (or six
zombies), four zombie gnolls, or a single zombie fire giant. Note
that this is based on the standard racial Hit Die norm; thus, a
high-level adventurer would be animated as a skeleton or zombie of 1
or 2 Hit Dice, and without special class or racial abilities. The
caster can, alternatively, animate two small animal skeletons (1-1
Hit Die or less) for every level of experience he has achieved.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The spell requires a drop of
blood, a piece of flesh of the type of creature being animated, and a
pinch of bone powder or a bone shard to complete the spell. Casting
this spell is not a good act, and only evil priests use it
frequently.</font></p>

clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado
(including a whirlwind formed by a djinn or air elemental of 7 Hit
Dice or more). The caster is then able to call down bolts of
lightning. The caster can call down one bolt per turn. The caster
need not call a bolt of lightning immediately--other actions, even
spellcasting, can be performed; however, the caster must remain
stationary and concentrate for a full round each time a bolt is
called. The spell has a duration of one turn per caster level. Each
bolt causes 2d8 points of electrical damage, plus an additional 1d8
points for each of the caster's experience levels. Thus, a 4th-level
caster calls down a 6d8 bolt (2d8+4d8).</font></p>

creature. In the third case, the continual light affects the space
about 1 foot behind a creature that successfully rolls its saving
throw vs. spell (a failed saving throw means the continual light is
centered on the creature and moves as it moves). Note that this spell
also blinds a creature if it is successfully cast upon the creature's
visual organs. If the spell is cast on a small object that is then

to cure most diseases by placing his hand upon the diseased creature.
The affliction rapidly disappears thereafter, making the cured
creature whole and well in from one turn to 10 days, depending on the
type of disease and the state of its advancement when the cure took
place. (The DM must adjudicate these conditions.) The spell is also
effective against parasitic monsters such as green slime, rot grubs,
and others. When cast by a priest of at least 12th level, this spell
cures lycanthropy if cast within three days of the infection. Note

To be effective, the priest must touch the intended victim, and the
victim must fail a saving throw vs. spell. The severity of the
disease is decided by the priest (debilitating or fatal). The exact
details of the disease are decided by the DM, but the following are

The disease takes effect in 1d6 turns, after which the creature loses
1 point of Strength per hour until his Strength is reduced to 2 or
less, at which time the recipient is weak and virtually helpless. If
a creature has no Strength rating, it loses 10% of its hit points per
Strength loss, down to 10% of its original hit points. If the disease
also affects hit points, use the more severe penalty. Recovery
requires a period of 1d3 weeks.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	First, it has a chance to
remove spells and spell-like effects (including device effects and

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Each effect or potion in the
spell's area is checked to determine if it is dispelled. The caster
can always dispel his own magic; otherwise, the chance depends on the
difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The
base chance of successfully dispelling is 11 or higher on 1d20. If
the caster is of higher level than the creator of the effect to be
dispelled, the difference is </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>subtracted</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
from this base number needed. If the caster is of lower level, the
difference is </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>added</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
to the base. A die roll of 20 always succeeds and a die roll of 1

caster or any other willing person can be put into a cataleptic state
that is impossible to distinguish from actual death. Although the
person affected can smell, hear, and know what is going on, no
feeling or sight of any sort is possible; thus, any wounding or
mistreatment of the body is not felt, no reaction occurs, and damage
is only one-half normal. In addition, paralysis, poison, or energy
level drain does not affect a person under the influence of this
spell, but poison injected or otherwise introduced into the body
becomes effective when the spell recipient is no longer under the
influence of this spell, although a saving throw is permitted.
However, the spell offers no protection from causes of certain
death--being crushed under a landslide, etc. Only a willing
individual can be affected by a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>feign

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A glyph of warding is a
powerful inscription magically drawn to prevent unauthorized or
hostile creatures from passing, entering, or opening. It can be used
to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or
box.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The priest must set the
conditions of the ward; typically any creature violating the warded
area without speaking the name of the glyph is subject to the magic
it stores. A successful saving throw vs. spell enables the creature
to escape the effects of the glyph. Glyphs can be set according to
physical characteristics, such as creature type, size, and weight.
Glyphs can also be set with respect to good or evil, or to pass those
of the caster's religion. They cannot be set according to class, Hit
Dice, or level. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area;
although if a cabinet had three drawers, each could be separately
warded.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When the spell is cast, the
priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding
sigil. For every 5 square feet of area to be protected, one round is
required to trace the warding lines of the glyph. The caster can
affect an area equal to a square the sides of which are the same as
his level, in feet. The glyph can be placed to conform to any shape
up to the limitations of the caster's total square footage. Thus, a
6th-level caster could place a glyph on a 6-foot x 6-foot square, a
4-foot x 9-foot rectangle, a 2-foot x 18-foot band, or a 1-foot by
36-foot strip. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery
become invisible.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The priest traces the glyph
with incense, which, if the area exceeds 50 square feet, must be
sprinkled with powdered diamond (at least 2,000 gp worth).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Typical glyphs shock for 1d4
points of electrical damage per level of the spellcaster, explode for
a like amount of fire damage, paralyze, blind, deafen, and so forth.
The DM may allow any harmful priest spell effect to be used as a
glyph, provided the caster is of sufficient level to cast the spell.
Successful saving throws either reduce effects by one-half or negate
them, according to the glyph employed. Glyphs cannot be affected or
bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they
can be dispelled by magic and foiled by high-level thieves using
their find-and-remove-traps skill.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

exact glyphs available to a priest depend on his religion, and he
might make new glyphs available according to the magical research
rules.</font></p>

decides how many animals can be affected, but the greater the number,

and will sense when he is facing in the direction of the object to be
located, provided the object is within range--for example, 90 yards

spell locates such objects as apparel, jewelry, furniture, tools,

his mind the items sought, the spell locates only that item.
Attempting to find a specific item, such as a kingdom's crown,

enables the caster to choose either of two different uses. The first
causes normal vegetation to grow, entwine, and entangle to form a
thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through at
a movement rate of 10 feet per round (or 20 feet per round for
larger-than-man-sized creatures). Note that the area must have brush
and trees in it in order for this spell to take effect. Briars,
bushes, creepers, lianas, roots, saplings, thistles, thorn, trees,
vines, and weeds become so thick and overgrown in the area of effect
as to form a barrier. The area of effect is a square 20 feet on a
side per level of experience of the caster, in any square or
rectangular shape that the caster decides upon at the time of the
spellcasting. Thus, an 8th-level caster can affect a maximum area of
a 160-foot x 160-foot square, a 320-foot x 80-foot rectangle, a
640-foot x 40-foot rectangle, a 1,280-foot x 20-foot rectangle, etc.

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The second use of the spell
affects a one-mile square area. The DM secretly makes a saving throw
(based on the caster's level) to see if the spell takes effect. If
successful, the spell renders plants more vigorous, fruitful, and
hardy, increasing yields by 20% to 50% ([1d4+1] x 10%), given a
normal growing season. The spell does not prevent disaster in the
form of floods, drought, fire, or insects, although even in these
cases the plants survive better than expected. This effect lasts only
for the life cycle of one season, the winter &quot;death&quot;
marking the end of a life cycle even for the sturdiest of trees. In
many farming communities, this spell is normally cast at planting
time as part of the spring festivals.</font></p>

cloud that lasts for one round per experience level of the caster.

extinguished, although a fire-based creature (such as a fire
elemental) used as a source suffers 1d4 points of damage, plus 1

surroundings. One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts
around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the
circle (note that the head of a worm or snake could be thus
ensnared).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a strong and supple tree
is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The magic of the spell
causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is
triggered, inflicting 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped,
and lifting it off the ground by the trapped member(s) (or strangling
it if the head/neck triggered the snare). If no such sapling or tree
is available, the cordlike object tightens upon the member(s), then
wraps around the entire creature, causing no damage, but tightly
binding it. Under water, the cord coils back upon its anchor point.
The snare is magical, so for one hour it is breakable only by cloud
giant or greater Strength (23); each hour thereafter, the snare
material loses magic so as to become 1 point more breakable per
hour--22 after two hours, 21 after three, 20 after four--until six
full hours have elapsed. At that time, 18 Strength will break the
bonds. After 12 hours have elapsed, the materials of the snare lose
all magical properties and the loop opens, freeing anything it held.
The snare can be cut with any magical weapon, or with any edged
weapon wielded with at least a +2 attack bonus (from Strength, for
example).</font></p>

caster. Flying insects appear 70% of the time, while crawling insects
appear 30% of the time. The exact insects called are bees, biting
flies, hornets, or wasps, if flying insects are indicated; biting
ants or pinching beetles, if crawling insects are indicated. A cloud
of the flying type, or a swarm of the crawling sort, appears after
the spell is cast. This gathers at a point chosen by the caster,
within the spell's range, and attacks any single creature the caster
points to.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The attacked creature
sustains 2 points of damage if it does nothing but attempt to flee or
fend off the insects during the time it is attacked; it suffers 4
points of damage per round otherwise. If the insects are ignored, the
victim fights with a -2 penalty to his attack roll and a +2 penalty
to his Armor Class. If he attempts to cast a spell, an initiative
roll should be made for the insects to see if their damage occurs
before the spell is cast. If it does, the victim's concentration is
ruined and the spell is lost.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The insects disperse and the
spell ends if the victim enters thick smoke or hot flames. Besides
being driven off by smoke or hot flames, the swarm might possibly be
outrun, or evaded by plunging into a sufficient body of water. If
evaded, the summoned insects can be sent against another opponent,
but there will be at least a 1 round delay while they leave the
former opponent and attack the new victim. Crawling insects can
travel only about 10 feet per round (maximum speed over smooth
ground) and flying insects travel 60 feet per round. The caster must
concentrate to maintain the swarm; it dissipates if he moves or is
disturbed.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It is possible, in
underground situations, that the caster might summon 1d4 giant ants
by means of the spell, but the possibility is only 30% unless giant
ants are nearby. This spell does not function under water.</font></p>

fails against entities of demigod status or greater, but their
servants or minions can be abjured. If the creature has a specific
(proper) name, it must be known and used. Any magic resistance of the
subject must be overcome, or the spell fails. The priest has a 50%
chance of success (a roll of 11 or better on 1d20). The roll is
adjusted by the difference in level or Hit Dice between the caster
and the creature being abjured; the number needed is decreased if the
priest has more Hit Dice and increased if the creature has more Hit
Dice. If the spell is successful, the creature is instantly hurled
back to its own plane. The affected creature must survive a system
shock check. If the creature does not have a Constitution score, the
required roll is 70% + 2%/Hit Die or level. The caster has no control
over where in the creature's plane the abjured creature arrives. If
the attempt fails, the priest must gain another level before another
attempt can be made on that particular creature.</font></p>

wild horses that may or may not be within summoning range. The DM

means they possess, staying until a fight is over, a specific mission
is finished, the caster is safe, he sends them away, etc. Only normal

caster is able to summon certain woodland creatures to his location.
Naturally, this spell works only outdoors, but not necessarily only
in wooded areas. The caster begins the incantation and continues
uninterrupted until some called creature appears or two turns have
elapsed. (The verbalization and somatic gesturing are easy, so this
is not particularly exhausting to the spellcaster.) Only one type of
the following sorts of beings can be summoned by the spell. They come
only if they are within the range of the call.</font></p>

times, for a different type each time. Once a call is successful, no
other type can be called without another casting of the spell. (The
DM will consult his outdoor map or base the probability of any such
creature being within spell range upon the nature of the area the
caster is in at the time of spellcasting.)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The creature(s) called by the
spell are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell (with a -4 penalty) to
avoid the summons. Any woodland beings answering the call are
favorably disposed to the spellcaster and give whatever aid they are
capable of. However, if the caller or members of the caller's party
are of evil alignment, the creatures are entitled to another saving
throw vs. spell (this time with a +4 bonus) when they come within 10
yards of the caster or another evil character with him. These beings
immediately seek to escape if their saving throws are successful. In
any event, if the caster requests that the summoned creatures engage
in combat on his behalf, they are required to roll a loyalty reaction
check based on the caster's Charisma and whatever dealings he has had
with them.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This spell works with respect
to neutral or good woodland creatures, as determined by the DM. Thus,

divinations will supply additional information. Note that if the

resembling the giant insects described in the Monstrous Manual. Only
one type of insect can be altered at one time (i.e., a single casting
cannot affect both an ant and a fly) and all insects affected must be
grown to the same size. The number of insects and the size to which
they can be grown depends upon the priest's level:</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, an 8th-level
priest can grow three insects to 3 Hit Dice, four insects to 2 Hit
Dice, or nine insects to 1 Hit Die. Flying insects of 3 Hit Dice or
more can carry a rider of human size (assume that such can carry 80
pounds per Hit Die).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the casting is interrupted
for any reason, or if the insects are currently subject to any other
magical effect (including this one), the insects die and the spell is
ruined. The DM decides how many normal insects of what type are
available; this is often a greater limitation on the spell than the
limits above.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the insect created by this
spell matches an existing monster description, use the monster
description. Otherwise, unless the DM creates a special description,
the giant form has an Armor Class of between 8 and 4, one attack, and
inflicts 1d4 points of damage per Hit Die.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, a 14th-level
priest uses the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>giant
insect</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell to
enlarge one beetle (all that is available) to 6 HD size. The DM
decides the beetle has AC 5 and bites once for 6d4 points of damage.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Note that the spell works
only on actual insects. Arachnids, crustaceans, and other types of
small creatures are not affected. Any giant insects created by this
spell do not attempt to harm the priest, but the priest's control of
such creatures is limited to simple commands (&quot;attack,&quot;
&quot;defend,&quot; &quot;guard,&quot; and so forth). Orders to
attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a
particular occurrence are too complex. Unless commanded to do
otherwise, the giant insects attempt to attack whoever or whatever is
near them.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The reverse of the spell,
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>shrink insect,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
reduces any giant insect to normal insect size. The number of Hit
Dice affected by the priest is subtracted from the number of Hit Dice
of the insects, and any insect reduced to 0 Hit Dice has been shrunk.
Partial shrinking is ignored; an insect is either shrunk or
unaffected. Thus, a 9th-level priest attacked by giant ants could
shrink three warrior ants or four worker ants to normal insect size
with no saving throw. This spell has no effect on intelligent
insectlike creatures.</font></p>

symbol for either version of the spell.</font></p>

forest. Priests attuned to the woodlands--as well as such creatures
as centaurs, dryads, green dragons, nymphs, satyrs, and
treants--recognize the forest for what it is. All other creatures
believe it is there, and movement and order of march are affected
accordingly. Touching the illusory growth neither affects the magic
nor reveals its nature. The hallucinatory forest remains until it is
magically dispelled by a reverse of the spell or a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>dispel

snake thus changed being venomous is 5% per caster level, if the

creature, which can be as big as the largest giant, to tread upon air
as if it were walking on solid ground. Moving upward is similar to
walking up a hill. A maximum upward angle of 45 degrees is possible
at one-half the creature's movement rate, as is a maximum downward
angle of 45 degrees at the normal movement rate. An air-walking
creature is in control of its movement, except when a strong wind is
blowing. In this case, the creature gains or loses 10 feet of
movement for every 10 miles per hour of wind velocity. The creature
can, at the DM's option, be subject to additional penalties in
exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control of
movement or suffering physical damage.</font></p>

radius, in which the wind is calm, exists around the caster. Note
that while the spell can be used underground, if the spell is   
cast in an area smaller than the area of effect, the eye shrinks 1
foot for every foot of confinement. For example, if the area of
effect is a 360-foot area, the eye shrinks by 10 feet to a 30-foot
radius; a space under 320 feet in a radius would eliminate the eye
and subject the spellcaster to the effects of the wind. Once the
spell is cast, the wind force increases or decreases by 3 miles per
hour per round until the maximum or minimum speed is attained. The
caster, with one round of complete concentration, can stabilize the
wind at its current strength, or set it to increase or decrease.
However, the rate of the change cannot be altered. The spell remains
in force for one turn for each level of experience of the caster.

took effect. Another caster can use a</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>

make the moonbeam move to any area that he can see and point to. This

disregard, delay, or perversion, the creature affected by the spell

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This powerful spell enables
the priest casting it to imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a
semblance of life. The animated object, or objects, then attacks
whomever or whatever the priest first designates. The animated object
can be of any nonmagical material whatsoever[md]wood, metal, stone,
fabric, leather, ceramic, glass, etc. Attempting to animate an object
in someone's possession grants that person a saving throw to prevent
the spell's effect. The speed of movement of the object depends on
its means of propulsion and its weight. A large wooden table would be
rather heavy, but its legs would give it speed. A rug could only
slither along. A jar would roll. Thus a large stone pedestal would
rock forward at 10 feet per round, a stone statue would move at 40
feet per round, a wooden statue 80 feet per round, an ivory stool of
light weight would move at 120 feet per round. Slithering movement is
about 10 feet to 20 feet per round; rolling is 30 feet to 60 feet per
round. The damage caused by the attack of an animated object depends
on its form and composition. Light, supple objects can only obscure
vision, obstruct movement, bind, trip, smother, etc. Light, hard
objects can fall upon or otherwise strike for 1d2 points of damage or
possibly obstruct and trip, as do light, supple objects. Hard,
medium-weight objects can crush or strike for 2d4 points of damage,
while larger and heavier objects may inflict 3d4, 4d4, or even 5d4
points of damage.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The frequency of attack of
animated objects depends on their method of locomotion, appendages,
and method of attack. This varies from as seldom as once every five
melee rounds to as frequently as once per round. The Armor Class of
the object per round. The Armor Class of the object animated is
basically a function of material and movement ability. Damage depends
on the type of weapon is effective against fabric, leather, wood, and
like substances. Heavy smashing and crushing weapons are useful
against wood, stone, and metal objects. Your DM will determine all of
these factors, as well as how much damage the animated object can
sustain before being destroyed. The priest can animate one cubic foot
of material for each experience level he has attained. Thus, a
14th-level priest could animate one or more objects whose solid
volume did not exceed 14 cubic feet[md]a large statue, two rugs,
three chairs, or a dozen average crocks.</font></p>

twice his level, if the creature conjured is determined randomly. If
a specific animal type is requested, the animal's Hit Dice cannot
exceed his level. The DM selects the type of animal that appears if
it is randomly called. Thus, a priest of 12th level could randomly
conjure two mammals with 12 Hit Dice each, four with 6 Hit Dice each,
six with 4 Hit Dice each, eight with 3 Hit Dice each, 12 with 2 Hit
Dice each, or 24 with 1 Hit Die each. Count every +1 hit point added
to a creature's Hit Dice as ¼ of a Hit Die. Thus a creature with 4 +
3 Hit Dice equals a 4 ¾ Hit Dice creature. The conjured animals
remain for two rounds for conjured animals remain for two rounds for
each level of the conjuring priest, or until slain, and they follow
the caster's verbal commands. Conjured animals unfailingly attack the
priest's opponents, but resist being used for any other purpose--they
do not like it, become noticeably more difficult to control, and may
refuse any action, break free, or turn on the caster, depending on
the nature of the creature and the details of the situation. The
conjured animals disappear when slain.</font></p>

waves of force roll forth from the caster, moving in the direction he
faces and causing all wooden objects in the path of the spell to be
pushed away from the caster to the limit of the area of effect.
Wooden objects above 3 inches in diameter that are fixed firmly are
not affected, but loose objects (movable mantles, siege towers, etc.)
move back. Objects less than 3 inches in diameter that are fixed
splinter and break, and the pieces move with the wave of force. Thus,
objects such as wooden shields, spears, wooden weapon shafts and
hafts, and arrows and bolts are pushed back, dragging those carrying
them with them. If a spear is planted to prevent this forced
movement, it splinters. Even magical items with wooden sections are
turned, although an anti-magic shell blocks the effects. A successful</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>

needle-sharp thorns as long as a person's finger. Any creature
breaking through (or crashing into) the wall of thorns suffers 8
points of damage, plus an additional amount of damage equal to the
creature's AC. Negative ACs subtract from the base 8 points of

chopped at, it takes at least four turns to cut a path through a

fires burn away the barrier in two turns, creating a wall of fire
effect while doing so (see </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>wall

of thorns appears up to 80 yards distant from the caster, as he
desires. The spell's duration is one turn for each level of
experience of the caster, and it covers one 10-foot cube per level of
the caster in whatever shape the caster desires. Thus a 14th-level
caster could create a wall of thorns up to 70 feet long by 20 feet
high (or deep) by 10 feet deep (or high), a 10-foot-high by
10-foot-wide by 140-foot-long wall to block a dungeon passage, or any
other sort of shape that suited his needs. The caster can also create
a wall of 5-foot thickness, which inflicts half damage but can be
doubled in one of the other dimensions. Note that those with the
ability to pass through overgrown areas are not hindered by this
barrier. The caster can dismiss the barrier on command.</font></p>

weather, fog, sleet, etc., could be summoned. Winter enables great
cold, blizzard, or thaw conditions to be summoned. Hurricane-force
winds can be summoned near coastal regions in the later winter or
early spring. The summoned weather is not under the control of the

for hours or even days in other cases. The area of effect likewise

caster is able to change a specially prepared staff into a treantlike
creature of the largest size, about 24 feet tall. When the priest
plants the end of the staff in the ground and speaks a special
command and invocation, the staff turns into a treantlike creature
with 12 Hit Dice, 40 hit points, and Armor Class 0. It attacks twice
per round, inflicting 4d6 points of damage with every successful
attack. The staff-treant defends the caster and obeys any spoken
commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot
converse with actual treants or control trees. The transformation
lasts either for as many turns as the caster has experience levels,
until the caster commands the staff to return to its true form, or
until the staff is destroyed, whichever occurs first. If the
staff-treant is reduced to 0 hit points or less, it crumbles to a
sawdustlike powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise, the staff
can be used again after 24 hours and the staff-treant is at full
strength.</font></p>

polished for another 28 days. The caster cannot adventure or engage
in other strenuous activity during either of these periods. The
finished staff, engraved with woodland scenes, is then rubbed with
the juice of holly berries, and the end of it is thrust into the
earth of the caster's grove while he casts a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>speak

brings forth a large, flaming chariot pulled by two fiery horses from
the elemental plane of Fire. These appear in a clap of thunder amid a
cloud of smoke. The vehicle moves at 24 on the ground, 48 flying, and
can carry the caster and up to seven other creatures of man-size or
less. The passengers must be touched by the caster to protect them
from the flames of the chariot. Creatures other than the caster and

that the chariot of Sustarre is a physical manifestation and can
sustain damage. The vehicle and steeds are struck only by magical
weapons or by water (one quart of which inflicts 1 point of damage).
They are Armor Class 2, and each requires 30 points of damage to
dispel. Naturally, fire has no effect upon either the vehicle or its
steeds, but magical fires other than those of the chariot can affect
the riders. Other spells, such as a successful</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>

far from the caster as possible in their most typical mode of
movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). This is not
panicked flight. Wandering creatures also have a 50% chance of using
any special innate movement abilities (plane shift, burrowing,
flight, etc.). Saving throws and actions are checked at the beginning
of each round. Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the
attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature.</font></p>

creatures involved, the DM may decide to assume average results. For
example, if there are 16 orcs affected and 25% could be expected to
successfully roll the saving throw, then four are assumed to have
succeeded, one wanders away, four attack the nearest creature, six
stand confused and the last acts normally but must check next round.
Since the orcs are not near the party, the DM decides that two who
are supposed to attack the nearest creature attack each other, one
attacks an orc that saved, and one attacks a confused orc, which
strikes back. The next round, the base is 11 orcs, since four
originally saved and one wandered off. Another one wanders off, five
stands confused, four attack, and one acts normally.</font></p>

creeping doom slays any creature subject to normal attacks, as each
of the small horrors inflicts 1 point of damage (each then dies after

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When this spell is employed,
the priest confronts some powerful creature from another plane
(including devas and other powerful minions, for instance, but not
demigods or deities of any sort) and requires of it some duty or
quest. A creature of an alignment opposed to the priest (e.g., evil
if the priest is good, chaotic if the priest is lawful) cannot be
ordered around unless it is willing. Note that an absolute (true)
neutral creature is effectively opposed to both good and evil, and
both law and chaos.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The spellcaster must know
something about the creature to exact service from it, or else he
must offer some fair trade in return for the service. That is, if the
priest is aware that the creature has received some favor from
someone of the priest's alignment, then the</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
exaction</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell can
name this as cause. If no balancing reason for service is known, then
some valuable gift or service must be pledged in return for the
exaction. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the
past or promised favor or reward, and with the being's effort and
risk. The spell then acts, subject to a magic resistance roll, as a
quest upon the being that is to perform the required service.
Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported
to the vicinity of the priest, and the priest must then and there
return the promised reward, whether it is irrevocable cancellation of
a past debt or the giving of some service or other material reward.
After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its
own plane.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM adjudicates when an
equitable arrangement has been reached. If the caster requests too
much, the creature is free to depart or to attack the priest (as if
the agreement were breached) according to its nature. If
circumstances leave the situation unbalanced (for example, the
creature dies while achieving a result that was not worth dying for),
then this might create a debt owed by the caster to the creature's
surviving kith and kin, making the caster vulnerable to a future</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
exaction</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell from
that quarter. Agreeing to a future exaction or release in the event
of catastrophic failure or death are common caster pledges in
securing an exaction.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Failure to fulfill the
promise to the letter results in the priest being subject to exaction
by the subject creature or by its master, liege, etc., at the very
least. At worst, the creature can attack the reneging priest without
fear of any of his spells affecting it, for the priest's failure to
live up to the bargain gives the creature immunity from the priest's
spell powers.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The material components of
this spell are the priest's holy symbol, some matter or substance
from the plane of the creature from whom an exaction is expected, and
knowledge of the creature's nature or actions that is written out on
a parchment that is burned to seal the pledge.</font></p>

effects: it causes an interdimensional connection between the plane

specific being of great power. The result of this connection is that
the sought-after being can step through the gate or portal, from its
plane to that of the priest. Uttering the spell attracts the
attention of the dweller on the other plane. When casting the spell,
the priest must name the entity he desires to make use of the gate
and to come to his aid. There is a 100% chance that</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>

on many factors, including the alignment of the priest, the nature of

priest. The DM will decide the exact result of the spell, based on
the creature called, the desires of the caster and the needs of the
moment. The being gates in either returns immediately or remains to
take action. Casting this spell ages the priest five years.</font></p>

additional Hit Dice (or hit points) and level functions accordingly.
Restoration is effective only if the spell is cast within one day of
the recipient's loss of life energy, per experience level of the

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By casting this spell, the
priest creates a powerful magic aura in some specially prepared
object--a string of prayer beads, a small clay tablet, an ivory
baton, etc. This object radiates magic, for it contains the power to
instantaneously transport its possessor to the sanctuary of the
priest who created its magic. Once the item is enchanted, the priest
must give it willingly to an individual, at the same time informing
him of a command word to be spoken when the item is to be used. To
make use of the item, the recipient must speak the command word at
the same time that he rends or breaks the item. When this is done,
the individual and all that he is wearing and carrying (up to the
maximum encumbrance limit for the character) are instantly
transported to the sanctuary of the priest, just as if the individual
were capable of speaking a</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The reversed application of
the spell causes the priest to be transported to the immediate
vicinity of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the
command word said. The priest has a general idea of the location and
situation of the item's possessor, and can choose not to be affected
by this summons. This decision is made at the instant when the
transportation is to take place. However, if he chooses not to go,
the opportunity is gone forever and the spell is wasted.</font></p>

special item (for either version of the spell) varies from 2,000 to
