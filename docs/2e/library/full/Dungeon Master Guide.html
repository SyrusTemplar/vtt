to the 2nd Edition</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A foreword is normally the
place where the author of a book expresses thanks and gratitude. I'm
not going to do that here. It's not that everyone involved doesn't
deserve congratulations and praise, it's just that I already said all
those things in the foreword to the AD&amp;D </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Player's
Handbook</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
Everything I said there is true for this book, too. On to other
things.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Let's assume that since
you're reading this, your are, or plan to be, a Dungeon Master. By
now, you should be familiar with the rules in the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Player's
Handbook</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">. You've
probably already noticed things you like or things you would have
done differently. If you have, congratulations. You've got the spirit
every Dungeon Master needs. As you go through this rule book, I
encourage you to continue to make these choices.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Choice is what the AD&amp;D
game is all about. We've tried to offer you what we think are the
best choices for your AD&amp;D campaign, but each of us has different
likes and dislikes. The game that I enjoy may be quite different from
your own campaign. But it is not for me to say what is right or wrong
for your game. True, I and everyone working on the AD&amp;D game have
had to make fundamental decisions, but we've tried to avoid being
dogmatic and inflexible. The AD&amp;D game is yours, it's mine, it's
every player's game.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So is there an &quot;official&quot;
AD&amp;D game? Yes, but only when there needs to be. Although I don't
have a crystal ball, it's likely that tournaments and other official
events will use all of the core rules in these books. Optional rules
may or may not be used, but it's fair to say that all players need to
know about them even if they don't have the memorized.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Player's
Handbook</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> and the
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Dungeon Master Guide</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
give you what you're expected to know, but that doesn't mean the game
begins and ends there. Your game will go in directions not yet
explored and your players will try things others think strange.
Sometimes these strange things will work; sometimes they won't. Just
accept this, be ready for it, and enjoy it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Take the time to have fun
with the AD&amp;D rules. Add, create, expand, and extrapolate. Don't
just let the game sit there, and don't become a rules lawyer worrying
about each piddly little detail. If you can't figure out the answer,
MAKE IT UP! And whatever you do, don't fall into the trap of
believing these rules are complete. They are not. You cannot sit back
and let the rule book do everything for you. Take the time and effort
to become not just a good DM, but a brilliant one.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At conventions, in letters,
and over the phone I'm often asked for the instant answer to a fine
point of the game rules. More often than not, I come back with a
question—what do </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>you</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
feel is right? And the people asking the questions discover that not
only can they create an answer, but that their answer is as good as
anyone else's. The rules are only guidelines.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the beginning of the first
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Dungeon Master
Guide</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">, Gary Gygax
stressed that each of us, working from a common base, would make the
AD&amp;D game grow in a variety of different directions. That is more
true today than ever. Don't be afraid of experimentation, but do be
careful. As a Dungeon Master, you have great power, and &quot;with
great power comes great responsibility.&quot; Use it wisely.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">One of the toughest challenges
facing a DM (and I can only assume that everyone reading this either
is, or wants to be, a DM) is keeping his game sessions fresh and
exciting.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Those of us who produce new
material for the AD&amp;D game as a whole have a more or less similar
task, although on a larger scale. We are constantly searching for
ways to make adventures and game accessories unique, or at least
original and distinctive. Like Sir Isaac Newton, we've learned from
experience that when faced with multiple choices, the simplest
alternative is often the best.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hence the book you hold in
your hands.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After six years, it was time
for the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Player's
Handbook</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> and
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Dungeon Master
Guide</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">, the two most
important AD&amp;D rule books, to get freshened up. What could be
better and simpler than a new coat of paint? Products that we publish
today don't look like products we published in 1989, or even in 1993.
We haven't changed the game in any substantial way (aside from the
usual clarifications and corrections that go along with any reprint).
But we have let these books catch up to our new standards. They're
larger, more colorful, and more readable, all with an eye toward
making your DMing job easier.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Bringing this project
together rekindled a lot of memories. In particular, one day from
1987 stands out in my mind. I remember it vividly because it was the
day when Dave Cook and I drew up the very first outline and schedule
for the 2nd Edition of the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. What
needed to be done, and how it should be done, looked clear and simple
on our neat, four-page report. In fact, that massive undertaking
occupied almost two years of our lives, and I've spent most of my
time since then caring for the AD&amp;D game.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	That's a job that we enjoy,
or we wouldn't be doing it. Most of us feel that we have a stake, to
one extent or another, in every AD&amp;D campaign out there. When you
and your players get together, the months (often years) of designing,
discussing, playtesting, redesigning, arguing, editing, sketching,
and head scratching disappear into the background. But no matter
whether you play by the books or with a binder full of home rules,
we're all in this together, united by the common thread of the AD&amp;D
game.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">You are one of a very special
group of people: AD&amp;D® game Dungeon Masters. Your job is not an
easy one. It requires wit, imagination, and the ability to think and
act extemporaneously. A really good Dungeon Master is essential to a
good game.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
Dungeon Master Guide</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
is reserved for Dungeon Masters. Discourage players from reading this
book, and certainly don't let players consult it during the game. As
long as the players don't know exactly what's in the</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
Dungeon Master Guide</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
they'll always wonder what you know that they don't. It doesn't
matter whether you have secret information; even if you don't, as
long as the players think you do, their sense of mystery and
uncertainty is maintained.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Also, this book contains
essential rules that are not discussed in the</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
Player's Handbook</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
Some of these rules the players will learn quickly during
play—special combat situations, the    costs of hiring NPCs,
etc. Others, however, cover more esoteric or    mysterious
situations, such as the nature of artifacts and other magical items.
This information is in the</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
Dungeon Master Guide</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
so the DM can control the players' (and hence the characters') access
to certain bits of knowledge. In a fantasy world, as in this world,
information is power. What the characters don't know</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
can </i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">hurt them (or
lead them on a merry chase to nowhere). While the players aren't your
enemies, they aren't your allies, either, and you aren't obligated to
give anything away for nothing. If characters go hunting wererats
without doing any research beforehand, feel free to throw lots of
curves their way. Reward those characters who take the time to do
some checking.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Besides rules, you'll find a
large portion of this book devoted to discussions of the principles
behind the rules. Along with this are examinations of the pros and
cons of changing the rules to fit your campaign. The purpose of this
book, after all, is to better prepare you for your role as game
moderator and referee. The better you understand the game, the better
equipped you'll be to handle unforeseen developments and unusual
circumstances.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One of the principles guiding
this project from the very beginning, and which is expressed
throughout this book, is this: The DM has the primary responsibility
for the success of his campaign, and he must take an active hand in
guiding it. That is an important concept. If you are skimming through
this introduction, slow down and read it again. It is crucial you
understand what you are getting into.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM's &quot;active hand&quot;
extends even to the rules. Many decisions about your campaign can be
made by only one person: you. Tailor your campaign to fit your own
style and the style of your players.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	You will find a lot of
information in this book, but you won't find pat answers to all your
questions and easy solutions for all your game problems. What you
will find instead is a discussion of various problems and numerous
triggers intended to guide you through a thoughtful analysis of
situations that pertain to your campaign.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The rules to the AD&amp;D 2nd
Edition game are balanced and easy to use. No role-playing game we
know of has been playtested more heavily than this one. But that
doesn't mean it's perfect. What we consider to be right may be
unbalanced or anachronistic in your campaign. The only thing that can
make the AD&amp;D game &quot;right'' for all players is the
intelligent application of DM discretion.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A perfect example of this is
the limit placed on experience levels for demihumans. A lot of people
complained that these limits were too low. We agreed, and we raised
the limits. The new limits were tested, examined, and adjusted until
we decided they were right. But you may be one of the few people who
prefer the older, lower limits. Or you may think there should be no
limits. In the chapter on character classes, you'll find a discussion
of this topic that considers the pros and cons of level limits. We
don't ask you to blindly accept every limit we've established. But we
do ask that before you make any changes you read this chapter and
carefully consider what you are about to do. If, after weighing the
evidence, you decide that a change is justified in your game, by all
means make the change.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In short, follow the rules as
they are written if doing so improves your game. But by the same
token, break the rules only if doing so improves your game.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Being a good Dungeon Master
involves a lot more than knowing the rules. It calls for quick wit,
theatrical flair, and a good sense of dramatic timing—among other
things. Most of us can claim these attributes to some degree, but
there's always room for improvement.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Fortunately, skills like
these can be learned and improved with practice. There are hundreds

is still the best: Find a group of people who already play the game

alternative is to get a copy of the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Introduction

creating his character. As the DM, however, your decisions have a
huge impact on the process. You have final approval over any player

consider about character creation and gives guidelines on how to deal
with some of the common problems that arise during character

Players What They Want</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Players in most AD&amp;D
games use the same character over many game sessions. Most players
develop strong ties to their characters and get a thrill from
watching them advance, grow, and become more successful and powerful.
Your game's success depends on how much your players care about their
characters. For these reasons, it is important to let they players
create the type of characters they really want to play.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the same time, watch out
for a tendency in some players to want the most powerful character
possible. Powerful characters are fine if that's the sort of campaign
you want. A problem arises, however, if players are allowed to
exploit the rules, or your good nature, to create a character who is
much more powerful than everyone else's characters. At best, this
leads to an unbalanced game. At worst, it leads to bored players and
hurt feelings.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Therefore, before any player
in your game creates his first character, decide which dice-rolling
method to allow: will you use method I, any of the five alternate
methods, or a seventh method of your own devising? Be prepared with
an answer right away, because this is one of the first questions your
players will ask.</font></p>

a Character Creation Method</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The following methods are
different from one another. Some produce more powerful characters
than others (although none produces extremely powerful characters).
For this reason, every player in your game should start out using the
same method.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If, at some later point in
your campaign, you want to change methods, simply announce this to
your players. Try to avoid making the announcement just as a player
starts rolling up a new character, lest the other players accuse you
of favoritism. You know you aren't playing favorites, but it doesn't
hurt to avoid the appearance.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Method I
(3d6, In order):</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This is the fastest and most
straightforward. There are no decisions to make while rolling the
dice, and dice rolling is kept to a minimum. Ability scores range
from 3 to 18, but the majority fall in a range from 9 to 12. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Typically, a character will
have four scores in the average range, one below-average score, and
one above-average score. A few lucky players will get several high
scores and a few unlucky ones will get just the opposite.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Very high scores are rare, so
character classes that require high scores (paladin, ranger,
illusionist, druid, bard) are correspondingly rare. This makes
characters who qualify for those classes very special indeed. The
majority of the player characters will be fighters, clerics, mages,
and thieves. Characters with exceptional ability scores will tend to
stand out from their comrades.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">First, some
players may consider their characters to be hopelessly average.
Second, the players don't get many choices.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Using method I, only luck
enables a player to get a character of a particular type, since he
has no control over the dice. Most characters have little choice over
which class they become: Only one or two options will be open to
them. You might let players discard a character who is totally
unsuitable and start over.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This method has all the
benefits of methods II and III. Few, if any, characters are likely to

<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Method V
(4d6, drop lowest, arrange as desired):</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before choosing to use this
method, think about how adventurers fit into the population as a
whole. There are two schools of thought.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One holds that adventurers
are no different from everyone else (except for being a little more
foolhardy, headstrong, or restless). The man or woman down the street
could be an adventurer--all that's required is the desire to go out
and be one. Therefore, adventurers should get no special bonuses on
their ability rolls.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The other school holds that
adventurers are special people, a cut above the common crowd. If they
weren't exceptional, they would be laborers and businessmen like
everyone else. Player characters are heroes, so they should get
bonuses on their ability rolls to lift them above the rabble.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If you choose method V for
creating player characters, then you agree with this second view and
believe that adventurers should be better than everyone else.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This method creates
above-average characters. They won't be perfect, but the odds are
that even their worst ability scores will be average or better. More
scores push into the exceptional range (15 and greater). It is easy
for a player to create a character of any class and race.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Method
V Disadvantages:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Like other
methods that allow deliberate arrangement of ability scores, this one
takes some time. It also creates a tendency toward &quot;super&quot;
characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Unless you have a
considerable amount of experience as a DM, however, beware of
extremely powerful characters. They are much more difficult to
challenge and control than characters of moderate power. On the plus
side, their chance for survival at lower levels is better than
&quot;ordinary&quot; characters. (See &quot;Super Characters,&quot;
below, for more on this subject.)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One last point about method
V: High ability scores are less exciting under this method, since
they are much more common, as the fighter characters below indicate:</font></p>

VI (points plus dice):</font></font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This gives players more
control over their characters than the other methods. A points system
makes it quite likely that a player can get the character he
wants--or at least the class and race. However, in doing so the
player must make some serious compromises.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It is unlikely that his dice
are going to be good enough to make every score as high as he would
like. In all likelihood, only one or two ability scores will be
exceptional, and miserable dice rolling could lower this even
further. The player must carefully weigh the pros and cons of his
choices when creating the character.</font></p>

Characters</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One of the great temptations
for players is to create super characters. While this is not true of
every player all the time, the desire for power above everything else
afflicts most players at one time or another.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Many players see their
characters as nothing more than a collection of numbers that affects
game systems. They don't think of their characters as personalities
to be developed. Players like this want to &quot;win&quot; the game.
These players are missing out on a lot of fun.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If players are creating new
characters for your campaign, you probably won't have to deal with
such super characters. Players can start with ability scores greater
than 18 only if the race grants a bonus, but this is extremely rare.
Later in the campaign, magic might raise ability scores higher.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The greatest difficulty
occurs when a player asks to bring in a character from another
campaign where characters are more powerful. Unless you are prepared
to handle them, super characters can seriously disrupt a campaign:
Players with average characters gradually become bored and irritated
as the powerful characters dominate the action. And players with
powerful characters feel held back by their weaker companions. None
of this contributes to harmony and cooperation among the characters
or the players.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Cooperation is a key element
of role-playing. In any group of player characters, everyone has
strengths to contribute and weaknesses to overcome. This is the basis
for the adventuring party--even a small group with sufficiently
diverse talents can accomplish deeds far greater than its size would
indicate.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now, throw in a character who
is an army by himself. He doesn't need the other characters, except
perhaps as cannon fodder or bearers. He doesn't need allies. His
presence alone destroys one of the most fundamental aspects of the
game--cooperation.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are no absolute rules
to define a too-powerful character, since the definition will vary
from campaign to campaign. Characters who are average in your game
may be weaklings in your friend's campaign. His characters, in turn,
could be frail compared to other groups. Some experience is required
to strike the right balance of power, but characters created using
the same method should, at least, be comparable.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When someone brings a
character from a different campaign and wants to use him in your
game, compare the proposed character to those already in the game.
You don't want him to be too strong or too weak. Certainly you should
be wary of a character whose ability scores are all 18s!</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If you decide a character is
too powerful, the player has two choices. First, he can agree to
weaken the character in some fashion (subject to your approval). This
may be as simple as excluding a few magical items (&quot;No, you
can't bring that</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
holy avenger sword +5</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
that shoots 30-dice fireballs into my campaign!&quot;). Second, the
player can agree not to use some special ability (&quot;I don't care
if your previous DM gave your character the Evil Eye, you can't jinx
my dice rolls!&quot;). If this sort of change seems too drastic or
requires altering ability scores or levels, a better option is simply
to have the player create a new character. The old character can be
used, without tinkering, in the campaign for which he was created.
The new character, more appropriate to your campaign, can develop in
your game. Remember that just because another DM allowed something is
no reason you have to do the same!</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the other extreme from the
super character is the character who appears hopeless. The player is
convinced his new character has a fatal flaw that guarantees a quick
and ugly death under the claws of some imaginary foe. Discouraged, he
asks to scrap the character and create another.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In reality, few, if any,
characters are truly hopeless. Certainly, ability scores have an
effect on the game, but they are not the overwhelming factor in a
character's success or failure. Far more important is the cleverness
and ingenuity the player brings to the character.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a player bemoans his bad
luck and &quot;hopeless&quot; character, he may just be upset because
the character is not exactly what he wanted. Some players write off
any character who has only one above-average ability score. Some
complain if a new character does not qualify for a favorite class or
race. Others complain if even one ability score is below average.
Some players become stuck in super-character mode. Some want a
character with no penalties. Some always want to play a particular
character class and feel cheated if their scores won't allow it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some players cite numerical
formulas as proof of a character's hopelessness (&quot;A character
needs at least 75 ability points to survive&quot; or &quot;A
character without two scores of 15 or more is a waste of time&quot;).
In reality, there is no such hard and fast formula. There are, in
fact, few really hopeless characters.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before you agree that a
character is hopeless, consider the player's motives. Try to be firm
and encourage players to give &quot;bad&quot; characters a try. They
might actually enjoy playing something different for a change.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A character with one or more
very low score (6 or less) may seem like a loser, like it would be no
fun to play. Quite simply, this isn't true! Just as exceptionally
high scores make a character unique, so do very low scores. In the
hands of good role-players, such characters are tremendous fun.
Encourage the player to be daring and creative. Some of the most
memorable characters from history and literature rose to greatness
despite their flaws.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In many ways, the completely
average character is the worst of all. Exceptionally good or
exceptionally bad ability scores give a player something to base his
role-playing on--whether nimble as a cat or dumb as a box of rocks,
at least the character provides something exciting to role-play.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Average characters don't have
these simple focal points. The unique, special something that makes a
character stand out in a crowd must be provided by the player, and
this is not always easy. Too many players fall into the &quot;he's
just your basic fighter&quot; syndrome.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In truth, however, even an
average character is okay. The only really hopeless character is the
rare one that cannot qualify for any character class. The playability
of all other characters is up to you.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All of the above
notwithstanding, you don't want to force a player to accept a
character he doesn't really like. All you will do is lose a player.
If someone really is dissatisfied, either make some adjustments to
the character or let him roll up a new one.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When adjusting ability
scores, follow these guidelines:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
• <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Don't adjust an ability
score above the minimum required to qualify for a particular class or
race. You are being kind enough already without giving away 10
percent experience bonuses.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
• <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Don't adjust an ability
score above 15. Only two classes have ability minimums higher than
15: paladins and illusionists. Only very special characters can
become paladins and illusionists. If you give these classes away,
they lose their charm.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
• <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Don't adjust an ability
score that isn't required for the race or class the player wants his
character to be.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
• <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Think twice before raising
an ability score to let a character into an optional class if he
already qualifies for the standard class in that group. For example,
if Kirizov has the scores he needs to be a half-elf fighter, does he
really need to be a half-elf ranger? Encourage the player to develop
a character who always wanted to be a ranger but just never got the
chance, or who fancies himself a ranger but is allergic to trees.
Encourage role-playing!</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sooner or later player
characters are going to gain wishes. Wishes are wonderful things that
allow creative players to break the rules in marvelous ways.
Inevitably, some player is going to use a wish to raise his
character's ability scores. This is fine. Player characters should
have the chance to raise their ability scores. It can't be too easy,
however, or soon every character in your campaign will have several
18s.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a wish is used to
increase a score that is 15 or lower, each wish raises the ability
one point. A character with a Dexterity of 15, for example, can use a
wish to raise his Dexterity to 16.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the ability score is
between 16 and 20, each wish increases the ability score by only
one-tenth of a point. The character must use 10 wishes to raise his
Dexterity score from 16 to 17. The player can record this on his
character sheet as 16.1, 16.2, etc. Fractions of a point have no
effect until all 10 wishes have been made.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a character of the warrior
group has a Strength score of 18, each wish increases the percentile
score by 10 percent. Thus, 11 wishes are needed to reach Strength 19.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This rule applies only to
wishes and wish-like powers. Magical items (manuals, books, etc.) and
the intervention of greater powers can automatically increase an
ability score by one point, regardless of its current value.</font></p>

with Multiple Characters</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Each player usually controls
one character, but sometimes players may want or need more. Multiple
player characters are fine in the right situation.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once your campaign is
underway and players learn more about the game world, they may want
to have characters in several widely scattered areas throughout that
world. Having multiple characters who live and adventure in different
regions allows a lot of variety in the game. The characters usually
are spread far enough apart so that events in one region don't affect
what transpires in the other.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes players want to try
a different class or race of character but do not want to abandon
their older, more experienced heroes. Again, spreading these
characters out across the world is an effective means of keeping them
separate and unique.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Whenever possible, avoid
letting players have more than one character in the same area. If,
for some reason, players must have more than one character in an
area, make sure that the characters are of significantly different
experience levels. Even this difference should keep them from
crossing paths very often.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If multiple player characters
are allowed, each character should be distinct and different. It is
perfectly fair to rule that multiple characters controlled by one
person must be different classes--perhaps even different races. This
helps the player keep them separate in his imagination.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a player has more than one
character available, ask him to choose which character he wants to
use for the adventure--before he knows what the adventure is about.
If a single adventure stretches across several playing sessions, the
same character should be used throughout. All of the player's other
characters are considered busy with something else during this time.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Avoid letting players take
more than one character along on a single adventure. This usually
comes up when the group of characters assembled for the planned
adventure is too small to undertake it safely. The best solution to
this problem is to adjust the adventure, use a different adventure
entirely, or supplement the party with NPC hirelings.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Playing the role of a single

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">One single
player/multiple character problem that needs to be nipped in the bud
is that of shared equipment. Some players will trade magical items,
treasure, maps, and gear back and forth among their characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, when Phaedre
goes adventuring she takes along Bertramm's </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>ring
of invisibility</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
Bertramm, in exchange, gets the use of Phaedre's </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>boots
of speed</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">. In short,
each character has the accumulated treasure of two adventurers to
draw on.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Do not allow this! Even
though one player controls both characters, those characters are not
clones. Their equipment and treasure is extremely valuable. Would
Phaedre loan her boots to a character controlled by another player?
How about an NPC? Probably not, on both counts. Unless the character
is (foolishly) generous in all aspects of his personality, you have
every right (some might call it a duty) to disallow this sort of
behavior.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Information is a
much more difficult problem. Your players must understand the
distinction between what they know as players and what their
characters know. Your players have read the rules and shared stories
about each other's games. They've torn out their hair as the entire
party of adventurers was turned into lawn ornaments by the medusa who
lives beyond the black gateway. That is all player information. No
other characters know what happened to that group, except this: they
went through the black gateway and never returned.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The problem of player
knowledge/character knowledge is always present, but it is much worse
when players control more than one character in the same region. It
takes good players to ignore information their characters have no way
of knowing, especially if it concerns something dangerous. The best
solution is to avoid the situation. If it comes up and players seem
to be taking advantage of knowledge they shouldn't have, you can
discourage them by changing things a bit. Still, prevention is the
best cure.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And remember, when problems

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When you look at a completed
character, you will notice there are still many unanswered questions:
Who were the character's parents? Are they still alive? Does the
character have brothers and sisters? Where was he born? Does he have
any notable friends or enemies? Are his parents wealthy or are they
poor? Does he have a family home? Is he an outcast? Is he civilized
and cultured, or barbaric and primitive? In short, just how does this
character fit into the campaign world?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are no rules to answer
these questions. The</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>

presume to tell you exactly what your campaign world will be like.
These decisions are left to you.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Consider what would happen if
the rules dictated answers to the questions above. For example,
suppose the rules said that 50% of all characters come from
primitive, barbaric backgrounds...and you're running a campaign set
in a huge, sophisticated city (the New Rome of your world). Even more
ridiculous would be the reverse, where the rules say 50% of the
characters are city dwellers and your campaign is set in a barbaric
wilderness. Or how would you explain things if 20% of all characters
were seafarers and you had set your adventures in the heart of a
desert larger than the Sahara?</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of course, you don't have to

enthusiasm, and ideas needed. Your task is to provide direction and
control.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Allow your players to decide
what kind of people their characters are. One could be a rough nomad,
another an over-civilized fop, others, homespun farmboys or salty
seadogs. Let the players decide, and then tell them if, and how,
their characters fit into your campaign world.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a player says, &quot;My
dwarf's a rude and tough little guy who doesn't like humans or
elves,&quot; you can respond with &quot;Fine, he's probably one of
the Thangor Clan from the deep mountain regions.&quot; This type of
cooperation spurs your creativity, and involves the players in your
world right from the start. You must come up with answers to their
questions and ways to make their desires work in the campaign. The
will be rewarded with the feeling of getting the characters they
want.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A carefully well-crafted
character background can do more than just provide emotional
satisfaction. It can also provide motivation for the player
characters to undertake specific adventures:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Just what is a dwarf of the
Thangor Clan doing outside his clan's mountainous homeland? Is he an
outcast looking for some way to redeem himself? Maybe he's a restless
soul eager to see the bright lights of the big city and the world.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A character can have parents
to avenge, long-lost siblings to track down, a name to clear, or even
a lost love to recapture. Background can be used to build sub-plots
within the overall framework of the campaign, enriching character
descriptions, and interactions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Background should not be
forced: Do not insist that a player take upon his character a
crippled grandmother, three sisters stolen by gypsies, a
black-hearted rival, and a stain on the family name. Instead, see if
the player has any ideas about his character. Not every player will,
but the AD&amp;D game depends as much on the players' fantasies as it
does on yours.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Characters who players are

of Nobility:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Some players
like the idea of their character being Prince So-and-So or the son of
Duke Dunderhead. All too often this leads to an abuse of power.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The player assumes, somewhat
rightfully and somewhat not, that the title endows his character with
special privileges--the right to instant income, the right to flaunt
the law, the right to endless NPCs, information, and resources--or,
worst of all, the right to use clout to push the other members of the
party around. This kind of character quickly becomes tiresome to the
other players and will constantly find ways to upset carefully
planned adventures.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Titles can be allowed, but
the DM will have to put some controls on noble characters. The
easiest and most effective method is to strip the title of all
benefits that, by rights, should go with it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The noble character could be
the son of a penurious duke. The son may be next in line to inherit
the title when his father dies, but he's also in line to inherit his
father's debts! Instead of seeking to impress others in public, the
poor son might be quite happy to keep a low profile so as not to
attract his father's creditors. After all, it's hard to amass a
fortune through adventuring when the bill collectors are always on
hand to take it away.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Likewise, a princely
character could be the son of an unpopular and despotic or
incompetent king--perhaps even one who was overthrown for his abuses.
Such a son might not want his lineage well-known, since most of the
peasants would have less than happy recollections of his father's
rule.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of course, these kinds of
manipulations on your part soon become tiresome, both to yourself and
the players. Not every duke can be impoverished, nor every throne
usurped. Going too far with this strategy will only destroy the
validity of nobility and titles in your game.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In the long run, it is better
for your player characters to begin untitled, with one of their goals
being the possibility of earning the right to place a &quot;Sir'' or
&quot;Lady'' before their names. Imagine their pride as you confer
this title on their character (and imagine the trials they must have
gone through to earn this right).</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Another problem
you might have to deal with is characters from wealthy, upper-class
families. (This is often associated with the problem of titles since
the nobility normally is the upper class.) Such characters, being
wealthy, lack one of the basic reasons to adventure--the desire to
make a fortune.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Indeed, they see their own
money as a way to buy solutions to their problems. Often they will
propose eminently reasonably (and, to the DM's carefully planned
adventures, quite disastrous) schemes to make their adventuring life
easier. It is, of course, possible to hire a wizard to construct
magical items. And a wealthy 1st-level character could buy a vast
army. But these sorts of things will have undesirable effects on your
campaign.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are ways to control
these problems while still allowing players the character backgrounds
they desire. Think of the real world and how difficult it is to
convince family and friends to give you money, especially sizeable
amounts of cash. You may have a loving family and generous friends,
but there is a limit.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In your campaign, parents may
grow tired of supporting their children. Brothers could become upset
at how player character relatives are cheating them out of their
share of an inheritance. Sisters may take exception to the
squandering of their dowries.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Standard medieval custom
called for inheritances--land and chattels--to be divided equally
among all of a man's sons. (This is one reason Charlemagne's empire
crumbled after his death.) You can use this custom to whittle a
wealthy character's purse down to size.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Further, families are not
immune to the effects of greed and covetousness--many a tale revolves
around the treachery one brother has wrought upon another. A rich
character could awaken to discover that his family has been swindled
of all it owns.</font></p>

role-playing tool. It provides the player with more information about
his character, more beginning personality on which to build. It

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Many factors affect a
character's background. Two of the most important are his race and
his character class (see Chapter 3, &quot;Player Character Classes&quot;).
In a sense, a character's class is his profession. Some characters
are fighters, some are mages, some are clerics, and so on. A
character's race affects which character classes are available to
him. Only humans have unlimited class options. All non-human races
are limited to some extent. There are two reasons for this:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	First, the restrictions are
intended to channel players into careers that make sense for the
various races. Dwarves are, to a certain degree, anti-magical and
incapable of shaping magical energy--they can't be wizards.
Halflings, despite their ties to nature, lack the devotion and
physical will to be druids. Similar situations exist for the other
demihuman races.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

have advantages that are not available to humans. Flexibility, the

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM can, if he chooses,
make any class available to any race. This will certainly make your
players happy. But before throwing the doors open, consider the
consequences.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the only special advantage
humans have is given to all the races, who will want to play a human?
Humans would be the weakest race in your world. Why play a 20th-level
human paladin when you could play a 20th-level elven paladin and have
all the abilities of paladins</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
and</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> elves?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If none of the player
characters are human, it is probably safe to assume that no
non-player characters of any importance are human either. Your world
would have no human kingdoms, or human kings, emperors, or powerful
wizards. It would be run by dwarves, elves, and gnomes.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This is not necessarily a bad
thing, but you must consider what kind of world non-humans would
create. Building a believable fantasy world is a daunting task;
creating a believable</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
alien</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> fantasy world
(which is what a world dominated by non-humans would be) is a huge
challenge even for the best writers of fantasy.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	What would non-human families
be like? What would the popular entertainment be? What would
non-humans value? What would they eat? What would their governments
be like? A society governed by nature-loving elves would be a very
different place than a human-dominated world.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It is possible that certain
character classes might not even exist. Paladinhood, for example,
could be a uniquely human perspective. Would elves and dwarves hold
the same values of law, order, god, and community to which a paladin
aspires? If you only change the image (i.e., have elven paladins
behave exactly like human paladins), what you've got is the
&quot;humans-in-funny-suits&quot; syndrome. Even within the human
race there are vast cultural differences. Think how much greater
these differences would be if the blood were entirely different.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Also, if humans are weak,
will the other races treat them with contempt? With pity? Will humans
be enslaved? All things considered, humans could have a very bad time
of it. If, after considering all the potential pitfalls, you decide
to experiment with non-standard class selections, do so carefully. We
offer the following advice:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Allow nonstandard race/class
combinations only on a case-by-case basis. If you institute a general
rule--&quot;Gnomes can now be paladins&quot;--you will suddenly find
yourself with six player character gnome paladins.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a player desperately wants
to play a gnome paladin, ask him to come up with a thoughtful
rationale explaining why this gnome is a paladin. It must be
plausible and consistent with your campaign setting. If the rationale
satisfies you, allow that player, and only that player, to play a
gnome paladin. Explain to the other players that this is an
experiment.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Don't allow any other gnome
paladins in the game until you have seen the first one in action long
enough to decide whether the class fits into your game. If it does,
congratulations--you've broadened your players' horizons. If it
doesn't, don't hesitate to tell the gnome paladin player that he has
to retire the character or convert him to a normal fighter. Never
allow someone to continue playing a character who is upsetting your
game.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By following this simple
rule, you can test new race/class combinations without threatening
your campaign. Moderation is the key to this type of experimentation.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition to unlimited
class choice, humans can attain any level in any class. Once again,
this is a human special ability, something no other race has. In the
AD&amp;D game, humans are more motivated by ambition and the desire
for power than the demihuman races are. Thus, humans advance further
and more quickly.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Demihumans can attain
significant levels in certain classes, but they do not have the same
unlimited access. Some players may argue that the greater age of
various non-humans automatically means they will attain greater
levels. That can present problems.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Demihuman characters are
limited in how high a level they can achieve both to preserve
internal consistency (humans are more flexible than non-humans) and
to enforce game balance. A DM, however, can change or eliminate these
limits as he sees fit. As with class restrictions, the consequences
must be examined in detail.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Given their extremely long
lifespans, demihumans without limitations would quickly reach levels
of power far beyond anything attainable by humans. The world would be
dominated by these extremely powerful beings, to the exclusion of
humans. Human heroes would be feeble compared to the heroes of elves
and dwarves.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Given their numerous
advantages, demihumans would be the most attractive races--no one
would play a human. Again, this isn't necessarily bad, but it's very
different. The resulting game will be completely unlike the standard
sword-and-sorcery milieu. You might need to set the campaign in an
ancient age, before the ascendance of men (though given the
situation, it's unlikely that men would ever become dominant).</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If you decide to allow
demihumans unlimited advancement, consider this option: To counteract
the demihumans' long life, slow down their advancement. Require
demihumans to earn two, three, or even four times as many experience
points as a human to advance a level.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This allows the short-lived
humans to advance more quickly than their long-lived comrades, who
will eventually catch up after the humans' demise. If this solution,
though logical, is unacceptable to your players, a compromise may be
called for.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The best compromise is to
allow demihumans normal (or double-cost) advancement to their
&quot;maximum&quot; levels. Then require them to earn triple or
quadruple experience points to advance beyond that point. They will
advance very slowly, but the players will still have a goal and the
sense of accomplishment that comes with rising a level.</font></p>

</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Player's Handbook</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
are only a few of the possible intelligent races populating the
worlds of the AD&amp;D game. Adventurous DMs and players may want to
experiment with characters of other races, such as orcs,
lycanthropes, ogres, lizardmen, or even dragons.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before you do this, however,
you need to know very clearly what you are getting into. Unrestricted
or ill-considered use of non-standard races can easily and quickly
destroy a campaign. Always consider a new race from a variety of
angles:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	How does the new race fit
with the other player characters? How does it fit in the campaign in
general? What could you accomplish with this race that you couldn't
with another?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The majority of players who
want to play an unusual race desire only the thrill and excitement of
a truly challenging role-playing situation. There are, however, a few
players who see such races as a way to take advantage of game systems
and campaign situations. As with changing level limits and classes
allowed, you are well advised to move slowly and carefully in this
area.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Allowing player characters of
unusual races introduces a whole new set of problems. In creating a
new non-human or demihuman player character race, the rules and
guidelines below should be followed to preserve game balance.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>The

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">(i.e., it must
have two hands, at least two legs, and stand generally upright). The
race must be able to move about on land. It must also be intelligent.
An orc or a centaur would be acceptable.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>The

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">beyond the scope
of those already given for the other player character races. Although
a dragon can polymorph into human form, it makes an unlikely player
character because it has a breath weapon, can change shape, can cast
spells, and is not humanoid in its natural state. A brownie probably
would not be a player character because it, too, has abilities beyond
those of the standard player character races.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>The

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">and willing to
interact with the human world. The duergar, a race of deep-dwelling
dwarves, have no desire to deal with humans and avoid contact
whenever possible. Satyrs resent intruders into their woods and
glades, which rules them out as player characters. You must judge
this criterion based on the conditions in your game world.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If these conditions are met,
the race can be considered as a possible player character race. Some
examples of races that definitely fit the profile are half-orcs,
orcs, half-ogres, lizardmen, goblins, centaurs, and kobolds.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When experimenting with a new
player character race, allow only one at the start. Do not begin your
experiment with a whole party of half-ogres! Start slowly, involving
only one player. If the new race is too powerful, it can be easily
eliminated.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once the new race is
selected, the real work begins. Examine the race and apply all of the
following guidelines to it.</font></p>

the nuts and bolts of character classes, explaining the mechanics of
how they work and what they can do, but there is more to being a DM
than just knowing the hard and fast rules. Character classes form the
heart of the AD&amp;D game, so it is useful to understand some of the
concepts and relationships that define classes and how they function.</font></p>

Level, and the Common Man</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Character class and level are
useful game measures of a character's talents and abilities. Every
class outlines a basic role for the character, a position and career
in life. Each level defines additional power and provides a system
whereby you can quantify and balance encounters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With only a little practice
you learn that characters of X classes and levels can easily defeat
monster Y, but that monster Z will give them serious problems. This
helps you create exciting, balanced adventures for your players.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Yet, at the same time, you
know that the concept of classes and levels doesn't really apply to
the real world. The teamster driving the wagon that passes the
characters isn't a 1st-, 5th-, or 100th-level teamster. He is a man,
whose job it is to drive wagons and haul goods. The chambermaid is
not a special class, nor are her abilities defined by levels.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The teamster or chambermaid
may be exceptionally skilled and competent, but for them this is not
measured in character classes. There is no such thing as a teamster
or chambermaid class, any more than there are merchant, sailor,
prince, blacksmith, hermit, navigator, tinker, beggar, gypsy, or
clerk classes. These are the things people do, not all-encompassing
descriptions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Nor are all the people in
your campaign world fighters, mages, thieves, or whatever. The
situation would be utterly ridiculous if every NPC had a character
class. You would have fighter chambermaids, mage teamsters, thief
merchants, and ranger children. The whole thing defies logic and
boggles the mind. Most non-player characters are people, just people,
and nothing more.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Only a few people actually
attain any character level. Not every soldier who fights in a war
becomes a fighter. Not every urchin who steals an apple from the
marketplace becomes a thief. The characters with classes and levels
have them because they are in some way special.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This specialness has nothing
to do with ability scores, class abilities, or levels. Such
characters are special by definition. The fact that player characters
are controlled by players renders them special. Perhaps these special
characters are more driven or have some unknown inner spark or just
the right combination of talents and desires. That's up to the
players. Similarly, non-player characters with classes are special
because the DM says so. Plain and simple. There is no secret reason
for this--it just is.</font></p>

Characters</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The great mass of humanity,
elf-kind, the dwarven clans, and halflings, are &quot;0-level&quot;
(zero-level) characters. They can gain in wisdom and skill, but they
do not earn experience points for their activities. These common folk
form the backbone of every fantasy world, doing the labor, making
goods, selling cargos, sailing oceans, building ships, cutting trees,
hauling lumber, tending horses, raising crops and more. Many are
quite talented in the various arts and crafts. Some are even more
proficient than player characters with the same training. After all,
0-level characters earn their livings doing this kind of work. For
player characters such proficiencies are almost more of a hobby.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For the vast majority of
0-level NPCs you create and use in your game, all you need to know is
a name, a personality, and an occupation. When the characters deal
with the blacksmith or the innkeeper, there's no need to create
ability scores, THACO, to-hit adjustments, Armor Class, and the like.
This does assume, of course, that your player characters don't go
attacking every blacksmith and innkeeper in sight. If they do, you
need to know a little more about 0-level characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Ability
Scores:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">These range from
3-18. For simplicity, don't worry about racial modifiers for the
demihuman races. Racial modifiers to combat, Armor Class, hit points,
etc., do apply.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Proficiencies:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">At best, a
0-level character will have one weapon proficiency, if that
character's profession reasonably allows for it. For example, a
blacksmith could be proficient with a warhammer and an innkeeper
might be allowed skill with a club (the axe handle under the bar...),
but there's little chance a clerk is going to be skilled with any
type of weapon.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In nonweapon proficiencies,
0-level characters have as many as are needed (and reasonable) given
their profession and age. Thus, a blacksmith might be quite
accomplished at the forge, having spent several proficiencies on the
slot. Novices and incompetent craftsmen have the bare minimum
training and skill. Typical journeymen spend two or three slots on
their main skill. Experts and brilliant artists usually devote all
their ability to a single proficiency. Masters, who watch over the
work of journeymen and apprentices, are normally no more accomplished
than journeymen but have additional proficiencies in other business
areas.</font></p>

unrealistic that a typical peasant can be killed by a single sword
blow, a fall from a horse, or a thrown rock. In the real world,
people can and do die from these causes. At the same time, however,
others survive incredible injuries and wounds.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When it is necessary to the
success of an adventure (and only on extremely rare occasions), you
can give 0-level characters more hit points. The situation could have
come about for any number of reasons: magic, blessings from on high,
some particularly twisted curse (the peasant who could not die!)--you
name it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It is also useful to make
important NPCs, such as 0-level kings or princes, tougher than the
average person. This is particularly important in the case of rulers,
otherwise some crazed player character is going to overthrow the
campaign kingdom with a single swipe of his sword. This is normally
not a desirable result.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If most people do not fall
into a particular character class, how common are those with
character classes and how do they fit into the society around them?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This is an important
question, one you will answer as you create your campaign. You don't
have to sit down and think out an exact answer (&quot;2% of the
population are adventurers&quot;), although you can get that precise
if you want. More likely, the answer will form over time as you
populate villages, create encounters, and DM game sessions--you will
unconsciously make your choices about frequency and character role.
There are, however, differences in how frequently the different
classes will logically show up.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Fighters</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Fighters are by far the most
common character types in normal campaigns. They must meet the least
stringent class requirements and are drawn from the biggest pool of
talent--soldiers of innumerable armies, mercenary companies,
militias, palace guards, temple hosts, and sheriff's men. In these
and other forces, the potential fighter learns his trade. He is
taught how to handle weapons and care for them. He picks up some
basic tactics and earns acceptance as a fighting man.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	From these ranks some go on
to become 1st-level fighters. Such men are often given rank in
recognition of their talents. Thus, a 1st-level fighter may become a
corporal or a sergeant. As the ranks become greater and more
influential, the tendency is to award these to higher level fighters.
However, this trend is not absolute and often breaks down at the
highest levels. The captain of the company may be a 12th-level
fighter, but he would still take orders from a 0-level prince!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Level is no guarantee of
rank, nor is rank fixed to level. Some people don't want
responsibility and all that comes with it. They would rather let
other people tell them what to do. Such characters may become
accomplished fighters but never advance beyond the rank of common
soldier. Political maneuvering and favoritism can raise even the
lowest level character to the highest positions of authority.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Since fighters tend to rise
above the level of the common soldier, few armies are composed of
high- or even low-level fighters. While there is little difference in
ability between the typical foot soldier and a 1st-level fighter, it
is just not possible to find an army of 20,000 4th-level fighters.
It's rare enough to find 1,000 or so 2nd-level fighters in a single
unit. Such units are elite, superbly trained and outfitted, and are
normally held in reserve for special tasks. They may be the shock
troops of an assault, a special bodyguard, or the reserve of an army
held back for pursuit.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Adventurer fighters (whether
player characters or NPCs) are those who have struck out on their
own. Not every man is content to take orders or give orders, and fame
seldom comes to the common foot soldier. Some men are willing to try
to rise through the ranks, but it is by no means an easy or speedy
process. There aren't many openings, nor is it a path where skill at
arms guarantees success.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Given all this, it's not
surprising that most fighters opt for the more direct method of
adventuring. In the course of adventuring, though, many fighters find
themselves becoming leaders and commanders, assembling men around
them as they carve their own place in the world.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Paladins are rare, in part
because of the statistics of dice rolling and in part because
paladinhood is an exacting road for characters to follow. It is easy
to err and fall from the special state of grace required. Not every
character is up to these demands, but those few that are can be truly
special. You will not find units with thousands, hundreds, or even
tens of paladins. At best, they form small groups (such as the Twelve
Peers of Charlemagne or some of the Knights of the Round Table).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Often, because of the
sterling example they set, paladins lead others in battle. But, at
the same time, they tend to be ill-suited to the task of ruling,
which too often requires compromise of one's principles. It is common
to find the paladin working in association with the clergy of his
religion, but lone paladins, carrying their faith into the
wilderness, also appear in the tales of bards.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Rangers tend to be loners,
uncomfortable in the company of &quot;civilized&quot; men. They are
also uncommon, again due to the demanding ability requirements of the
class. These two factors make armies or companies of rangers most
unlikely, only marginally less common than hordes of paladins.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although loners, they do not
mind the company of other rangers, those who understand the ways of
the wilderness and the need for space. Small groups of rangers will
sometimes join an army as its scouts, especially if the need is
pressing. They will occasionally be found in forest villages or near
untracked wildernesses. Here, guides, scouts, woodsmen, trappers,
pioneers, and stalkers form the pool from which the ranger ranks are
filled. Few can be found in civilized lands--rangers in cities are
truly oddities.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Wizards</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Wizards are the most
iconoclastic and self-important of all the character classes, for
they are unique among all character classes. The peasant can pick up
a sword and fight; a pious man can hope to serve his faith; a local
wag can spin a good tale; and an unprincipled cad can rob the local
merchants. But no one other than a wizard can cast magical spells.
The need for highly specialized training truly sets them apart, and
they know it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When mages gather, they tend
to form societies or associations, organizations for men who speak of
things not understood by the common folk (much like scientists
today). But wizards are too fractious and independent a lot to
organize themselves into proper unions--they can barely manage to
form moderately organized guilds.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Generally, their groups exist
for such high-minded reasons as to &quot;facilitate the exchange of
knowledge&quot; or &quot;advance the state of the science of magic.&quot;
Some prepare texts or papers to share with fellow mages, detailing
their latest experiments and discoveries or outlining some new
theory. They enjoy the recognition of their peers as much as anyone.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To outsiders, wizards seem
aloof and daunting. Like craftsmen, they are most comfortable in the
company of their fellows, speaking a language they all understand.
The untrained, even apprentices, are intruders upon this fellowship
and are apt to receive an icy and rude reception.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Wizards are an eccentric,
even perverse, lot. They're likely to be found just about anywhere.
Nonetheless, they have an affinity for civilization, ranging from
small villages to vast cities. Only a few mages actually care to
adventure since it is an extremely dangerous undertaking to which
they are ill-trained and ill-suited. The vast majority spend their
time experimenting in seclusion or working in the service of others,
preferably well paid.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Many mages, especially those
of lesser ability, turn their art to practical ends--almost every
village has a fellow who can whip up a few useful spells to help with
the lambing or simplify the construction of a house. In larger
cities, these mages become more specialized, such that one might lend
his talents to construction, another to the finding of lost things,
and a third to aiding the local jewelers in their craft.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Nearly all major families,
merchant princes, and nobles have a mage or two in their employ. A
few attempt (generally without success) to have these wizards
mass-produce magical items. The problem is that wizards are as
difficult to manage as rangers or paladins. They do not care for
others bossing them around or encroaching upon their perceived
privileges and rights, especially since they have the magical
resources to make their displeasure known. Also, they are usually
kept busy finding ways to strike at their employer's rivals (or
thwarting such attempts against their own lord). Foolish is the king
who does not have a personal wizard, and lamentable is the ruler who
trusts the wrong mage.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Not all wizards spend their
time in the service of others. Some seek naught but knowledge. These
scholar-mages tend to be viewed much like great university professors
today--noble and distant, pursuing truth for its own sake. While not
directly in the service of others, they can sometimes be commissioned
to perform some duty or answer some question.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The wealthy often provide
endowments for such men, not to buy their services (which aren't for
sale) but to curry their favor in hopes that they will provide honor,
glory, and just perhaps something useful. This situation is not
unlike that of the great artists of the Renaissance who were
supported by princes hoping to impress and outdo their rivals.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are wizards who spend
all their time shut away from humanity in dark, forbidding towers or
gloomy, bat-infested caves. Here they may live in rooms where opulent
splendor mingles with damp foulness. Perhaps the strains and demands
of their art have driven them mad. Perhaps they live as they do
because they see and know more than other men. Who knows? They are,
after all, eccentric in the extreme.</font></p>

<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Priests</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Priest characters are not
required to take up arms and set out on adventures to smite evil. No,
their hierarchies require administrators, clerks, and devout workers
of all types. Thus, although there may be many clergymen and women at
a temple or monastery, only a few will have a character class and
levels.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Not all monks at a monastery
are 1st-level (or higher) clerics. Most are monks or nuns, devout men
and women working to serve their faith. Non-adventuring clergy are no
less devout than their adventuring brethren, nor do they receive any
less respect. Thus, it is possible to have leaders within a religious
hierarchy who show no signs of special clerical ability, only proper
faith and piety.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even more so than with
military men, though, level is not a determiner of rank. Wisdom and
its use, not the application of firepower or the number of foemen
smitten, are the true pearls of the clergy. Indeed the goal of some
beliefs is to demonstrate the greatest wisdom by divesting oneself of
all earthly bonds--power, wealth, pride, and even level abilities--in
an attempt to attain perfect harmony with everything.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In the end, adventuring
priests tend to form a small nucleus of crusaders for the faith. They
are the ones who demonstrate their faith by braving the dangers that
threaten their beliefs, the ones who set examples through trials and
hardships. From these, others may spiritually profit.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Thieves</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thieves are often people who
don't fit in elsewhere. Unlike other classes, nearly all thieves are
adventurers, often by necessity. True, many settle permanently in a
single are and live off the local population, but when your life
tends to be in defiance of the local law, you have to be ready to
leave at a moment's notice! Each job is an adventure involving great
risks (including, possibly, death), and there are precious few
opportunities to relax and let your guard down.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thieves occasionally form
guilds, especially in major cities and places with a strong sense of
law and order. In many cases, they are forced to cooperate merely to
survive. Influential thieves see guilds as a way to increase their
own profits and grant them the image of respectability. They become
dons and crimelords, directing operations without ever having to
dirty their hands.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the same time, the
membership of a thieves' guild is by definition composed of liars,
cheats, swindlers, and dangerously violent people. Thus, such guilds
are hotbeds of deceit, treachery, and back-stabbing (literally). Only
the most cunning and powerful rise to the top. Sometimes this rise is
associated with level ability, but more often it is a measure of the
don's judge of character and political adeptness.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Curiously, thieves who are
masters of their craft tend not to advance too high in the
organization. Their talents in the field are too valuable to lose,
and their effort is expended on their art, not on maneuvering and
toadying. There is, in fact, no rule that says the leader of the
thieves' guild has to be a thief. The leader's job involves charisma,
character appraisals, and politicking--the powerful crimelord could
turn out to be a crafty merchant, a well-educated nobleman, or even
an insidious mind flayer.</font></p>

<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Bards</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Bards are rare and, like
thieves, tend to be adventurers, but for somewhat different reasons.
They do occasionally violate the law and find it necessary to move on
to the next town--and the next adventure--but more often they are
driven by curiosity and wanderlust. Although some bards settle down
in a town or city, most travel from place to place. Even &quot;tamed&quot;
bards (as the settled ones are sometimes called) feel the urge to go
out and explore, gather a few more tales, and come home with a new
set of songs. After all, the entertainment business demands variety.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are generally no bard
guilds or schools, no colleges, societies, or clubs. Instead, bards
sometimes band in secret societies, loose affiliations that allow
them to improve their art while maintaining an aura of mystery.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Most frequently, however,
bards rely on the informal hospitality of their kind. Should one bard
arrive in the town of another, he can reasonably expect to stay with
his fellow for a little while, provided he shares some of his lore
and doesn't cut into his host's business. After a time, during which
both bards learn a few of the other's tales and songs, the visitor is
expected to move on. Even among bards it is possible to overstay
one's welcome.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of course, there are times
when a bard decides not to leave but to set up shop and stay. If the
population is big enough to support both bards, they may get along.
If it isn't, there will almost certainly be bad blood between the
two. Fortunately, though, one or the other can usually be counted on
to get wanderlust and set out on some great, new adventure. Bards do
tend to be incurable romantics, after all.</font></p>

<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	While the character
discussion above provides a structure for adventurers in the game,
your own campaign might be quite different. For example, there is no
rule that says mages can't form strong guilds. Such a group would
have a profound impact on the campaign world, however. With their
magical might, they could control virtually any facet of life they
chose--politics, trade, class structure, even private behavior. Such
a group would alter the amount of magic in your campaign and who
possessed it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Organized mages might even
attempt to limit the activities of those who present a threat to
their power, such as adventurers. Whenever you alter the balance of
the character classes, be sure you consider what the changes could do
to your campaign.</font></p>

Characters</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Along with character classes
and levels comes the natural tendency to classify campaigns according
to the level of the characters. Experienced players speak of
&quot;low-level&quot; or &quot;high-level&quot; games in different
terms and, indeed, such games are different from one another. Also
differing from game to game, however, is the definition of high
level.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Defining
&quot;High Level&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	What constitutes a low- or
high-level game is a matter of taste. Generally, DMs and players find
a range of character levels that is comfortable for their style of
play. Campaigns that commonly have 4th- to 8th-level characters
consider those with 12th-level or more to be high level, while those
with 12th-level characters set the limit closer to 18th or 20th
level. While there is no set break-point for high level, character
duties and responsibilities begin to change around between 9th and
12th level.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Generally, players find
battling monsters and discovering treasure to be less and less
satisfying as time goes on. Their characters' abilities are such that
monsters need to be almost ridiculously powerful to threaten them.
Treasures must be vast to make an impression. While incredible foes
and huge treasures are good once in a while, the thrill quickly wears
thin.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Changing
Campaign Styles</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When players begin to get
jaded, consider changing the style of the campaign. Higher level
characters have great power--they should have adventures where that
power influences and involves them in the campaign world. As leaders,
rulers, and wise men, their actions affect more than just themselves,
spreading outward in ripples over those they rule and those they seek
to conquer. Political machinations, spying, backroom deals,
treachery, and fraud become more pronounced. While these elements can
play a part in a low-level campaign, at higher levels, the stakes are
much greater.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Added intrigue can be
introduced into a campaign gradually. For example, Varrack, a
mid-level fighter, is appointed sheriff of a local village as a
reward for his sterling deeds. He can still adventure as he has been
accustomed to, but now he must also watch over the villagers. The DM
has the local bandits raid the trade road. As sheriff, Varrack must
stop them. He goes with a small group, only to discover a camp of 500
outlaws. Realizing he's badly outnumbered, he beats a hasty retreat,
raises a small militia, and clears the countryside of the enemy.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With this he rises in level.
In addition, his lord is pleased and grants Varrack stewardship of
several villages, with sheriffs under his command. The neighboring
baron (who organized and sent the bandits) notes Varrack's success
with mild displeasure, planting the seed of a festering hate. More
immediately, the craven and vengeful sheriff of the next village on
the road (whose incompetence allowed the bandits to flourish)
suddenly finds himself out of favor. He blames Varrack and searches
for a way to bring the new steward down.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As the campaign progresses,
the DM can slowly spin a web of intrigue around Varrack as enemies,
open and hidden, seek to block his progress or use him to topple his
own lord. Against the odds, Varrack may find himself destined to
become the king's champion, gaining new titles, responsibilities,
friends, and enemies along the way.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Theoretically, there is no
upper limit to character class levels (although there are racial
limitations). The material presented here takes characters only to
20th level--experience has shown that player characters are most
enjoyable when played within the 1-20 range. Above 20th level,
characters gain few additional powers and face even fewer truly
daunting adventures.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Consummate skill and
creativity are required to construct adventures for extremely
powerful characters (at least adventures that consist of more than
just throwing bigger and bigger monsters at the nearly unbeatable
party). Very high level player characters have so few limitations
that every threat must be directed against the same weaknesses. And
there are only so many times a DM can kidnap friends and family,
steal spell books, or exile powerful lords before it becomes old hat.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">When characters
reach the level where adventures are no longer a challenge, players
should be encouraged to retire them. Retired characters enter a
&quot;semi-NPC&quot; state. The character sheets and all information
are entrusted to the DM's care.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A retired character still
lives in the campaign world, usually settled in one spot, and
normally has duties that prevent him from adventuring. While in the
DM's care, he does not gain experience, use his magic items, or spend
his treasure. It is assumed that he has income to meet his normal
expenses.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The retired character can be
used to provide players with information, advice, and some material
assistance (if this is not abused). However, his or her overall
actions are controlled by the DM, not the player who originally
created the character.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If at all possible, player
characters should be encouraged to retire as a group. This way all
players can create and play new characters of approximately the same
level. If only one player retires his character to start a new
1st-level character while all the others continue with 20th-level
characters, the poor newcomer can't really adventure with them. (If
he does, the player won't get to do much or the character will have a
very short life expectancy!)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some players may be reluctant
to retire a favorite character. Explain to these players that
retirement doesn't mean the character can never be used again. Be
sure to create special adventures that require those high-level
heroes to come out and do battle.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Every once in a while the old
adventuring group may have to reassemble to deal with some threat to
the kingdom or the world. It's the chance to show those upstart new
characters just what a really powerful group can do! It also gives
the players the opportunity to role-play some the their old
favorites.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the players see the
opportunity to use their powerful characters, even infrequently, they
will be less reluctant to spend most of their playing time with new,
lower-level characters.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If at all possible, start
characters at 1st level. The lowest character levels are like the
early years of childhood. What happens to a character during these
first adventures will do much to determine how that character will be
role-played. Did Rath the Dwarf save the day by fool-hardily charging
into battle when he was a mere 1st level? If he did, the odds are
good the player will try it again and will begin to play Rath as a
bold and reckless fellow.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	On the other hand, if Rath
was clobbered the first few times he rushed in, the player would
begin to play Rath as a cautious, prudent fellow. Even the smallest
events can have a great effect on low-level characters, so these
events sharply etch the behavior of the character. Deny the player
these beginning levels and you are stripping him of the opportunity
to develop his character's personality.</font></p>

New and Old Characters</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Letting players start at the
beginning is fine when you first open a campaign, and all player
characters can begin at the same level. As sessions are played,
however, a disparity in character levels will develop. New players
will join the game and old players will create new characters.
Eventually, you'll reach a point where the original group of players
has characters many levels higher than when they began. How, then, do
you introduce new players and new player characters into your game?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are times when you
should allow a character to start above 1st level. A newly-created
character should begin a campaign no higher than 4th level unless the
group is very powerful. If this is the case, he should begin no
higher than the lowest level character in the party (and it may be
better to start a level or two lower).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The new character should have
equipment similar to that of his adventuring companions: If they have
horses, he should have a horse, too. But do not give him free magical
items. These he must earn. He should start with a small amount of
cash.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes a player can
replace a fallen character by promoting an NPC henchman to player
character status. This is a good method because the player is already
familiar with the NPC and may have created a personality for him.
When this happens, the player is given the NPC character sheet and
allowed to take full control of it.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It is useful to have a few
pre-rolled characters on hand. These should be of several different
levels and classes, with equipment and personality quirks noted.
These &quot;instant&quot; player characters can be used by guest
players (those only able to play in a few sessions) and by regular
players whose characters have died during the course of a session.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When the latter occurs,
introduce the new character at an appropriate point and then allow
the player to control it for the rest of the evening. This keeps that
player from being bored. If the player enjoys the character (and you
are pleased with the arrangement), you can allow him to continue
playing that character in future sessions.</font></p>

New Character Classes (Optional Rule)</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The character classes listed
in the rules are not the only ones that can exist in the AD&amp;D
game. Many other character classes, either general or highly
specialized, could also exist. Indeed, a common reaction of players
to the character classes is to question why their characters can't
have the powers or skills of another class. You can even create
entirely new classes or combinations of existing character abilities.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Creating a new character
class is not recommended for novice DMs or players. Before attempting
this, be sure that you are familiar and comfortable with the AD&amp;D
rules. Furthermore, it is not a good idea to use this system in a
brand-new campaign which has no background for players to base
actions and decisions on.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The class-creation system
here requires you to use your judgment--it isn't fool-proof. Without
careful thought, you may find you've created an overly forceful
combination of powers or a bizarre, unplayable character class. As
with new character races, start with a single test case before you
approve the class for all players.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Naturally, the DM must
approve a class before a player can begin using it. The DM also has
the right to make any changes he sees fit, even after the character
has been played for some time!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	You are advised not to try to
create a super class--a class that allows players to do everything.
Consider what is lost: A super character would require an immense
amount of experience just to reach 2nd level. Normal characters would
reach much higher levels, much sooner, and may even surpass the super
character in ability. A super character also destroys party
cooperation and group play. If you have a character who can do
everything, you don't need other characters (and hence other
players). Further, a whole group of super characters is nothing more
than a group of one-class characters. You lose as much variety, as
much color, as if you had a group consisting only of fighters. And a
group of fighters (or any other single class), no matter what their
abilities, is boring. There is nothing to distinguish Joe Fighter
from Fred Fighter in ability.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Another factor to consider
when creating new character classes is whether a new class is really
needed. Some players want to create a character class for every
profession or ability--jesters, witches, vampire hunters, vikings,
mountaineers, etc. They forget that these are really roles, not
classes.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	What is a viking but a
fighter with a certain outlook on life and warfare? A witch is really
nothing but a female wizard. A vampire hunter is only a title assumed
by a character of any class who is dedicated to the destruction and
elimination of those loathsome creatures.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The same is true of
assassins. Killing for profit requires no special powers, only a
specific reprehensible outlook. Choosing the title does not imply any
special powers or abilities. The character just uses his current
skills to fulfill a specific, personal set of goals.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before creating a character
class, stop and ask yourself, &quot;Is there already a character
class that can fill the niche?&quot; Think of ways an existing class
could fulfill the desired goal through role-playing and careful
choice of proficiencies. A mountaineer could easily be a fighter or
ranger, born and bred on the slopes, with a love of the rugged peaks
and proficiencies in climbing, mountaineering, and the like. There is
no need for a mountaineer class.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Also, consider how much fun
the character is going to be to play. This is particularly true when
you plan to create classes with highly specialized abilities. True,
there may be a place for wise old sages or alchemists, but would they
be fun to play? Consider that all the sage does is conduct research
and answer questions. An important task, perhaps, but boring when
compared to fighters, mages, and the like. Clearly there is no great
demand for the sage as a player character. So, there is no need for
the character class.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, remember that there
is no such thing as an exclusively NPC character class. What is the
logic of saying a non-player character can be such-and-such, but a
player character cannot? None. This is a false restriction. Every
character class you create should be open to player characters and

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To use this method, choose
different abilities you want the class to have. You must include some
aptitudes such as fighting. But other abilities, such as
spellcasting, are optional. Each ability you choose has a multiple
attached to it. As you select the abilities for your class and add
the multiples together. After you have chosen all the abilities,
multiply the base experience value (see Table 21) by this total. The
result is the number of experience points your new class must earn to
go up in levels.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Alignment is a shorthand
description of a complex moral code. It sketches out the basic
attitudes of a person, place, or thing. It is a tool for the DM. In
sudden or surprising situations, it guides the DM's evaluation of NPC
or creature reactions. By implication, it predicts the types of laws
and enforcement found in a given area. It affects the use of certain
highly specialized magical items.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For all the things alignment
is, there are some very important things that it is not. It is not a
hammer to pound over the heads of player characters who misbehave. It
is not a code of behavior carved in stone. It is not absolute, but it
can vary from place to place. Neither should alignment be confused
with personality. It shapes personality, but there is more to a
person than just alignment.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It is essential that each
character's alignment be noted in the DM's records for that
character. Are the alignments too different? Are they different
enough to break the party apart? Will this interfere with the planned
adventure or campaign?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes characters of
different alignments possess such radically varied world views to
make cooperation impossible. For example, a strict lawful good and a
chaotic neutral would find their adventuring marked by animosity and
mistrust. A true chaotic neutral would make just about anyone trying
to work with him crazy.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are two approaches to
an alignment problem in the group. The first is to explain the
problem to the players involved. Explain why their alignments could
cause problems and see if they agree or disagree. If necessary,
suggest some alignment changes--but never force a player to choose a
new alignment.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It is his character, after
all. Wildly different characters might find ways to work together,
making adventures amusing (at least) and maybe even successful in
spite of the group's problems.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The second approach requires
that players keep their alignments secret. Don't tell anyone that
there might be a problem. Let players role-play their characters and
discover the problems on their own. When problems arise, let the
characters work them out themselves. This approach is best suited to
experienced role-players, and even then it can play havoc with a
campaign. Since secrecy implies mistrust, this method should be used
with extreme caution.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	During play, pay attention to
the actions of the player characters. Occasionally compare these
against the characters' alignments. Note instances in which the
character acted against the principles of his alignment. Watch for
tendencies to drift toward another, specific alignment.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a character's class
requires that he adhere to a specific alignment, caution him when a
proposed action seems contrary to that alignment. Allow the player to
reconsider.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Never tell a player that his
character cannot do something because of his alignment. Player
characters are controlled by the players. The DM intervenes only in
rare cases (when the character is controlled by a spell or magical
item, for example).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally as in all points of
disagreement with your players, listen to their arguments when your
understanding of an alignment differs from theirs. Even though you go
to great effort in preparing your game, the campaign world is not
yours alone--it also belongs to your players.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Just as a well-played
character acts within the limits of his alignment, NPCs should act
consistently with their alignments. Judicious and imaginative use of
NPCs is what creates a believable fantasy world.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Alignment is a quick guide to
NPC and monster reactions. It's most useful when you don't want to
take the time to consult a page of tables and you haven't devised a
complete personality for every casually encountered NPC. NPCs tend to
act in accordance with their alignment (though they are no more
perfect in this regard than player characters).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thus, a chaotic evil gnoll
tends to react with threats and a show of might. It considers someone
who appeals to its compassion as a weakling, and it automatically
suspects the motives of anyone who tries to be friendly. According to
the gnoll's view of society, fear and bullying are the keys to
success, mercy and kindness are for the weak, and friends are good
only for the things they can provide--money, protection, or shelter.
A lawful good merchant, meanwhile, would tend to hold the opposite
view of things.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Remember, however, that
alignment is not personality. If every lawful good merchant is played
as an upright, honest, and friendly fellow, NPCs will become boring
in a hurry. Just because a merchant is lawful good doesn't mean he
won't haggle for the best price, or even take advantage of some
gullible adventurer who is just passing through. Merchants live by
making money, and there is nothing evil about charging as much as a
character is willing to pay. A chaotic good innkeeper might, quite
reasonably, be suspicious of or hostile to a bunch of ragged, heavily
armed strangers who stomp into his inn late at night. A chaotic evil
wizard might be bored and happy for a little companionship as he sits
by the inn's fire.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To create memorable NPCs,
don't rely solely on their alignment. Add characteristics that make
them interesting, adapting these to fit the character's alignment.
The merchant, perhaps feeling a little guilty about over-charging the
adventurer, might give the next customer a break on the price. The
innkeeper might be rude to the adventurers while clearly being
friendly to other patrons. The chaotic evil wizard might discover
that, while he wanted some companionship, he doesn't like the company
he got. He might even leave behind a token of his irritation, such as
bestowing the head of a donkey on the most annoying character.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Player characters, NPCs, and
monsters are not alone in having alignment. Since a kingdom is
nothing but a collection of people, united in some fashion (by
language, common interest, or fear, for example), it can have an
overall alignment. The alignment of a barony, principality, or other
small body is based on the attitude of the ruler and the alignment of
the majority of the population.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The alignment of the ruler
determines the nature of many of the laws of the land. Lawful good
rulers usually try to protect their territory and do what's best for
their subjects. Chaotic good rulers try to help people, but
irregularly, being unwilling to enact sweeping legislation to correct
a social ill.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the same time, the
enforcement of the laws and the attitudes found in the country come
not from the ruler but the subjects. While a lawful good king issues
decrees for the good of all, his lawful evil subjects could consider
them inconveniences to work around. Bribery might become a standard
method for doing business.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the situation is reversed
(a lawful evil king with mostly lawful good subjects), the kingdom
becomes an unhappy place, filled with grumbling about the evil reign
that plagues it. The king, in turn, resorts to severe measures to
silence his critics, creating even more grumbling. The situation is
similar to romantic portrayals of Norman England, with the good and
true peasants struggling under the evil yoke of Prince John (as in</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
Robin Hood</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> and

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The general alignment of an
area is determined by the interaction between ruler and ruled. Where
the ruler and the population are in harmony, the alignment tendency
of the region is strong. When the two conflict, the attitudes of the
people have the strongest effect, since the player characters most
often deal with people at this level. However, the conflict between
the two groups--subjects and lord--over alignment differences can
create adventure.</font></p>

an area allows a quick assessment of the kind of treatment player
characters can expect there. The following gives ideas for each

generally honest, law-abiding, and helpful. They mean well (at least
most of them do). They respect the law. As a rule, people don't walk
around wearing armor and carrying weapons. Those who do are viewed
with suspicion or as trouble-makers. Some societies tend to dislike
adventurers, since they often bring trouble.</font></p>

bureaucracies. The tendency to organize and regulate everything
easily gets out of control.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In large empires there are
ministries, councils, commissions, departments, offices, and cabinets
for everything. If the region attracts a lot of adventurers, there
are special ministries, with their own special taxes and licenses, to
deal with the problem. The people are not tremendously concerned with
the effectiveness of the government, so long as it functions.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The government
is marked by its severe laws, involving harsh punishments regardless
of guilt or innocence. Laws are not intended to preserve justice so
much as to maintain the status quo. Social class is crucial. Bribery
and corruption are often ways of life. Adventurers, since they are
outsiders who may be foreign agents, are viewed with great suspicion.
Lawful evil kingdoms often find themselves quashing rebellions of
oppressed peasants clamoring for humane treatment.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Areas dominated
by these three alignments tend to adopt whatever government seems
most expedient at the moment. A particular form of government lasts
as long as the ruler or dynasty in power can maintain it. The people
cooperate when it suits them--or, in the case of true neutrals, when
the balance of forces must be preserved.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Such neutral territories
often act as buffer states between lands of extreme alignment
difference (for example, between a lawful good barony and a vile
chaotic evil principality). They shift allegiance artfully to
preserve their borders against the advances of both sides in a
conflict.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Neutral evil countries tend
to be benign (but not pleasant) dictatorships while neutral good
countries are generally &quot;enlightened&quot; dictatorships.
Transfers of power are usually marked by shifts in government, though
these are often bloodless coups. There is a certain apathy about
politics and government. Adventurers are treated the same as everyone
else.</font></p>

well and try to do right, but are hampered by a natural dislike of
big government. Although there may be a single ruler, most
communities are allowed to manage themselves, so long as their taxes
are paid and they obey a few broad edicts. Such areas tend to have
weak law enforcement organizations. A local sheriff, baron, or
council may hire adventurers to fill the gap. Communities often take
the law into their own hands when it seems necessary. Lands on the
fringes of vast empires far from the capital tend to have this type
of alignment.</font></p>

Local government usually amounts to a series of strongarm bosses who
obey the central government out of fear. People look for ways to gain
power or keep the power they've got. Assassination is an accepted
method of advancement, along with coups, conspiracies, and purges.
Adventurers are often used as pawns in political power games, only to
be eliminated when the adventurers themselves become a threat.</font></p>

course, many other government types are possible. Furthermore, even
within the same kingdom or empire, there may be areas of different
alignment. The capital city, for example, where merchants and
politicians congregate, may be much more lawful (or evil, etc.) than
a remote farming community.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And alignment is only one
pattern of social organization. Not every nation or barony is defined

also be used--peaceful, warlike, barbaric, decadent, dictatorial, and
civilized are all possible descriptions.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	General alignments also can
be applied to religions. The beliefs and practices of the religion
determine its alignment. A religion that espouses understanding,
working in harmony with others, and good deeds is more than likely
lawful good. those that stress the importance of individual
perfection and purification are probably chaotic good.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It is expected that the
priests of a religion will adhere to its alignment, since they are
supposed to be living examples of these beliefs. Other followers of
the religion need not adhere exactly to its alignment. If a person's
alignment is very different from his religion's, however, a priest is
certainly justified in wondering why that person adheres to a
religion which is opposed to his beliefs and philosophy.</font></p>

of Magical Items</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Certain powerful magical
items, particularly intelligent ones, have alignments. Alignment in
these cases is not an indication of the moral properties of the item.
Rather, it is a means of limiting the number and types of characters
capable of using the item--the user's alignment must match the item's
alignment for the magic to work properly. Aligned magical items,
usually weapons, were created with a specific ethos in mind. the item
was attuned to this ethos by its creator.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Aligned items reveal their
true powers only to owners who share the same beliefs. In the hands
of anyone else, the item's powers remain dormant. An extremely
powerful item may even harm a character of another alignment who
handles the item, especially if the character's alignment is opposed
to the item's.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Aligned magical items should
be rare. When an item has an alignment, it is a sign of great power
and purpose. This creates opportunities for highly dramatic
adventures as the player characters learn about the item, research
its history, track it across the country, and finally discover its
ancient resting place and overcome the guards and traps set to
protect it.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A second, more insidious,
type of magical item is the one that changes a character's alignment.
Unlike the usual, gradual methods by which a character changes
alignment, magical alignment changes are instantaneous. The
character's personality undergoes an immediate transformation,
something like magical brainwashing. Depending on the new alignment,
the change may or may not be immediately noticeable. However, you
should insist that the player role-play his new situation. Do not
allow him to ignore the effects the alignment change will have on his
character's personality. Indeed, good role-players will take this as
an opportunity to stretch their skills.</font></p>

<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition to all its other
uses, alignment can become the central focus of a campaign. Is the
world caught in an unending struggle between the forces of good and
evil, law and chaos? The answer affects how the campaign world is
created, how the campaign is run, and how adventures are constructed.
It also affects players' perspectives on and reactions to various
situations and events.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In a typical campaign, the
primary conflict in the world is not a struggle between alignments.
The campaign world is one in which passion, desire, coincidence,
intrigue, and even virtue create events and situations. Things happen
for many of the same reasons as in the real world. For this reason,
it may be easier to create adventures for this type of campaign.
Adventure variety and excitement depend on the DM's sense of drama
and his ability as a storyteller. Occasionally player characters
discover a grand and hideous plot, but such things are isolated
affairs, not part of an overall scheme.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, for
conspiracy-conscious DMs, a different world view might be more
suitable, one where the powers of alignment (gods, cults, kingdoms,
elemental forces) are actively struggling against each other. the
player characters and NPCs may be agents of this struggle. Sometimes,
they are aware of their role. At other times, they have no idea of
their purpose in the grand scheme of things.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even rarer are those
campaigns where the player characters represent a third force in the
battle, ignored or forgotten by the others. In such a world, the
actions of adventurers can have surprising effects.</font></p>

in Conflict</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are advantages and
disadvantages to building a campaign around alignment struggles. On
the plus side, players always have a goal, even if they're not always
aware of it. This goal is useful when constructing adventures. It
motivates player characters and provides a continuing storyline; it
ensures that characters always have something to do (&quot;Restore
the balance of Law, loyal followers!&quot;). Also, a sense of heroism
permeates the game. Players know that their characters are doing
something important, something that has an effect on the history of
the campaign world.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are disadvantages to
this approach, too, but none that can't be avoided by a clever DM.
First is the question of boredom. If every adventure revolves around
maintaining balance or crusading for the cause, players might get
tired of the whole thing.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The solution is simply to
make sure adventures are varied in goal and theme. Sometimes
characters strive in the name of the great cause. Other times they
adventure for their own benefit. Not every battle needs to be a
titanic struggle of good vs. evil or light vs. darkness.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Another concern is that
everything the characters do may affect their quest. An aligned game
universe is one of massive and intricate cause-and-effect chains. If
X happens over here, then Y must happen over there. Most adventures
must be woven into the thread of the storyline, even those that don't
seem to be a part of it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This is in direct conflict
with the need for variety, and the DM must do some careful juggling.
A big quest is easy to work into the story, but what happens when the
player characters take some time off to go on their own adventure?
Are they needed just then? What happens in their absence? How do they
get back on track? What happens when someone discovers something no
one was meant to know? For these problems there are no easy answers.
A creative DM will never be idle with this sort of campaign.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, there is the problem
of success and failure. An aligned universe tends to create an epic
adventure. Player characters become involved in earthshaking events
and deal with cosmic beings. Being at the center of the game, player
characters assume great importance (if they don't, they will quickly
get bored). This is standard stuff in sword-and-sorcery fiction, so
it is natural that it also appears in a sword-and-sorcery
role-playing adventure.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Fiction writers have an
advantage DMs do not, however--they can end the story and never
return to it. At the end of the book, the good guys win, the world is
set right, and the covers are closed. The writer never has to worry
about it again, unless he wants to. What happens when characters win
the final conflict, the battle that puts all to right? What can be
done after peace and harmony come to the universe?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Further, the author knows who
is going to win. He starts by knowing the good guys will triumph.
There may be many twists, but eventually the heroes come out on top.
Many DMs make the same assumption. They are wrong.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Never simply assume that the
characters will win. What if they don't? What if the forces of
darkness and evil win the final battle? No matter how high the odds
are stacked in their favor, there is always a chance that the
characters will do something so stupid or unlucky that they lose.
Victory cannot be guaranteed. If it is, players will quickly sense
this and take advantage of it.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The best way to avoid the
problems described above is to design the characters' struggle so it
is never-ending. At the very least, the conflict is one that lasts
for millennia--well beyond the lifetimes of the player characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, to keep the players
from feeling frustrated, certain they can never accomplish anything,
their characters must be able to undertake sizable tasks and win
significant victories. Player characters fighting for the cause of
good may eventually drive back the growing influence of the chief
villain, but they defeat only a symptom, not the disease itself.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There always can be a new
threat. Perhaps the evil villain himself returns in a new and more
hideous manifestation. The DM must be prepared with a series of
fantastic yet realistic threats. These gradually increase in scope as
the characters become more powerful.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thus, it is possible to build
a campaign where the forces of alignment play an active role in
things. It is difficult, and there are many hazards, but imagination
and planning can overcome the obstacles.</font></p>

as a Tool</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even though it has been said
several times already, this point is important enough to
repeat--alignment is a tool to aid role-playing, not a hammer to
force characters to do things they don't want to do.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM should never tell a
player, &quot;Your character can't do that because it's against his
alignment,&quot; unless that character is under some type of special
magical control. Let players make their own decisions and their own
mistakes. the DM has enough to do without taking over the players'
jobs, too.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Despite this prohibition, the
DM can suggest to a player that an action involves considerable risk,
especially where alignment is concerned. If the player still decides
to go ahead, the consequences are his responsibility. Don't get upset
about what happens to the character. If the paladin is no longer a
paladin, well, that's just the way things are.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Such suggestions need not be
brazen. True, the DM can ask, &quot;Are you sure that's a good idea,
given your alignment?&quot; He can also use more subtle forms of
suggestion woven into the plot of the adventure. Tomorrow the cleric
intends to go on a mission that would compromise his alignment. That
night, he has a nightmare which prevents any restful sleep. In the
morning he runs into an old soothsayer who sees ill omens and
predicts dire results. His holy symbol appears mysteriously tarnished
and dull. The candles on the alter flicker and dim as he enters the
temple. Attentive players will note these warnings and may reconsider
their plans. If they do not, it is their choice to make, not the
DM's.</font></p>

what's your alignment?&quot; is a rude question. At best, any
character who is boorish enough to bring up the issue is likely to
receive a very icy stare (turning to shocked horror from more refined
characters).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Asking another character his
alignment is futile, anyway--a lawful good character may feel
compelled to tell the truth, but a chaotic evil character certainly
won't. A chaotic evil character with any wit would reply &quot;lawful
good.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Player characters can only
say what they think their alignment is. Once they have chosen their
alignment, the DM is the only person in the game who knows where it
currently stands. A chaotic good ranger may be on the verge of
changing alignment--one more cold-blooded deed and over the edge he
goes. But he doesn't know that. He still thinks he is chaotic good
through and through.</font></p>

character's alignment is just as offensive as asking him directly.
This is the sort of thing that starts fights and ends friendships.
Hirelings and henchmen may decide that a player character who does
this is too distrustful. Strangers often figure the spell is the
prelude to an attack and may strike first.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even those who consent to the
spell are likely to insist that they be allowed to cast the same in
return. Using these spells, besides being rude, indicates a basic
lack of trust on the part of the caster or questioner.</font></p>

in particular--possess a limited ability to detect alignments,
particularly good and evil. Even this power has more limitations than
the player is likely to consider. The ability to detect evil is
really only useful to spot characters or creatures with evil
intentions or those who are so thoroughly corrupted that they are
evil to the core, not the evil aspect of an alignment.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Just because a fighter is
chaotic evil doesn't mean he can be detected as a source of evil
while he is having a drink at the tavern. He may have no particularly
evil intentions at that moment. At the other end of the spectrum, a
powerful, evil cleric may have committed so many foul and hideous
deeds that the aura of evil hangs inescapably over him.</font></p>

Alignment</font></font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sooner or later, a player
character will change alignment. A character might change alignment
for many reasons, most of them have nothing to do with the player
&quot;failing&quot; to play his character's role or the DM &quot;failing&quot;
to create the right environment.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Player characters are
imaginary people. But, like real people, they grow and change as
their personalities develop. Sometimes circumstances conspire against
the player character. Sometimes the player has a change of attitude.
Sometimes the personality created for the player character just seems
to pull in an unexpected direction. These are natural changes. There
might be more cause for concern if no player character ever changes
alignment in a campaign.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There is no rule or yardstick
to determine when a character changes alignment. Alignment can change
deliberately, unconsciously, or involuntarily. This is one of those
things that makes the game fun. Players are free to act, and the DM
decides if (and when) a change goes into effect. This calls for some
real adjudication. There are several factors to consider.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Deliberate change is
engineered by the player. He decides he doesn't want to play the
alignment he originally chose. Perhaps he doesn't understand it, or
it's not as much fun as he imagined, or it's clear that the player
character will have a more interesting personality with a different
alignment.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All the player has to do is
have his character start acting according to the new alignment.
Depending on the severity of the actions and the determination of the
player, the change can be quick or slow.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Unconscious
Change</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Unconscious change happens
when the character's actions are suited to a different alignment
without the player realizing it. As in the case of a deliberate
alignment change, the DM must keep track of the character's actions.
If the DM suspects that the player believes his character is acting
within his alignment, the DM should warn the player that his
character's alignment is coming into question. An unconscious
alignment change should not surprise the player--not completely,
anyway.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Involuntary
Change</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Involuntary alignment change
is forced on the character. Most often this is the result of a spell
or magical item. Involuntary changes are immediate, and the
character's previous actions have little bearing on the change.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	During the course of play,
keep notes on the actions of the player characters. At the end of
each session, read through those notes, paying attention to any
unusual behavior. Note which alignment seems most appropriate to each
character's actions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If, over the course of
several playing sessions, a character's actions consistently fit an
alignment different from the character's chosen alignment, an
alignment change is probably in order. If small actions are taking a
character outside his alignment, the change should be gradual--maybe
even temporary. Severe actions could require an immediate and
permanent alignment change.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In the meantime, the paladin
could recognize his danger and amend his ways, preventing the change
and preserving his paladinhood. If the paladin burns the village to
prevent the disease from spreading, he commits a seriously evil act.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In this case, the DM is
justified in instituting an immediate alignment change to lawful evil
or even chaotic evil. The character eventually might be able to
change back to lawful good alignment, but he will never again be a
paladin.</font></p>

of Changing Alignment</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although player characters
can change alignment, it is not something that should be approached
lightly, since there are serious consequences. When a character
changes alignment, he does more than just change his attitudes. He is
altering his perception of the world and his relationship to it. Much
of what he learned previously was flavored by his alignment. When the
philosophical foundations of his life change, the character discovers
that he must relearn things he thought he knew.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are two possible
effects of changing alignment, depending on the situation and
circumstances of the change. The first results in no penalty. This
effect only should be used when the player and the DM mutually agree
that the character's alignment should be changed to improve the play
of the game.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Most often this occurs with
low-level characters. The player character's alignment may prove to
be incompatible with the rest of the party. A player character may
simply be more interesting for everyone if his alignment were
different. Inexperienced players may select an alignment without
fully understanding its ramifications. Discovering they simply do not
like the alignment, they may ask to change. Such changes must be made
with mutual agreement. As DM, try to accommodate the desires of your
players.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In the second type of
voluntary change, the case cannot be made that the alignment change
would be for the good of the game. This generally involves more
established characters who have been played according to one
alignment for some time. Here, the effects of alignment change are
severe and noticeable.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The instant a character
voluntarily changes alignment, the experience point cost to gain the
next level (or levels in the case of multi-class characters) is
doubled. To determine the number of experience points needed to gain
the next level (and</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
only</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> the next
level), double the number of experience points listed on the
appropriate Experience Levels table.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, Delsenora the
mage began the game neutral good. However, as she adventured, she
regularly supported the downtrodden and the oppressed, fighting for
their rights and their place in society. About the time she reached
5th level, it was clear to the DM that Delsenora was behaving more as
a lawful good character and he enforced an alignment change.
Normally, a mage needs 40,000 experience points--20,000 points beyond
5th level--to reach 6th level. Delsenora must earn 40,000 additional
experience points, instead of the normal 20,000. Every two experience
points counts as one toward advancement.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Delsenora started the
adventure with 20,000 experience points. At its conclusion, the DM
awarded her 5,300 points, bringing her total to 25,300. Instead of
needing just 14,700 points to reach the next level, she now needs
34,700 because of her alignment change!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If an alignment change is
involuntary, the doubled experience penalty is not enforced. Instead,
the character earns no experience whatever until his former alignment
is regained. This assumes, of course, that the character wants to
regain his former alignment.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the character decides that
the new alignment isn't so bad after all, he begins earning
experience again, but the doubling penalty goes into effect. The
player does not have to announce this decision. If the DM feels the
character has resigned himself to the situation, that is sufficient.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, Beornhelm the
Ranger carelessly dons a</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
helm of alignment change</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
and switches to chaotic evil alignment--something he didn't want to
do! Exerting its influence over him, the helm compels Beornhelm to
commit all manner of destructive acts. Although unable to resist,
Beornhelm keeps looking for an opportunity to escape the accursed
helm. Finally, after several misadventures, he cleverly manages to
trick an evil mage into removing the helm, at which point he is
restored to his previous alignment.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He gains no experience from
the time he dons the helm to the time he removes it (though the DM
may grant a small award if Beornhelm's plan was particularly
ingenious). If Beornhelm had chosen not to trick the mage but to work
with him, the change would immediately be considered a player choice.
From that point on Beornhelm would earn experience, but he would have
to earn twice as much to reach the next experience level.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A character can change
alignment any number of times. If more than one change occurs per
level, however, the severity of the penalty increases. (The character
is obviously suffering from severe mental confusion, akin to a
modern-day personality crisis.) When a character makes a second or
subsequent alignment change at a given level, all experience points
earned toward the next level are immediately lost. The character must
still earn double the normal experience.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Delsenora drifted into lawful
good. Now she finds lawful good too restrictive. She is confused. She
doesn't know what she believes in. Her head hurts. The character
reverts to her earlier neutral good habits. Bedeviled by indecision,
she loses the 5,300 experience points she had already gained and now
has to earn 40,000 to achieve 6th level!</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A character in the AD&amp;D
game, like anyone else, has a variety of skills and talents. He is
good at some things (because they are used in his profession or
hobby) and poor at those he has studied casually or not at all. These
skills and talents are called proficiencies.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Proficiencies aren't exactly
like the skills people pick up in school or in the &quot;real&quot;
world. They tend to be unrealistically broad or narrow, depending on
the subject. The fishing proficiency, for example, assumes the
character knows everything about both rod-and-reel fishing and net
fishing. In reality, these are two vastly different skills.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the other end of the
spectrum, weapon proficiencies tend to be very precise, highlighting
the subtle differences between weapons. A long bow and a short bow
differ in size, weight, pull, arrow length, and balance. Each demands
different practices to get optimum utility.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When using proficiencies,
remember that these rules are not intended to recreate reality. It
might have been more realistic to list different proficiencies for
each aspect of medieval botany--horticulture, herbalism, mycology,
etc. But in the context of a game, these are much better grouped
under a single proficiency. Individually, each proficiency would be
of such limited usefulness that all of them would become worthless.
Other proficiencies, particularly weapons, go to the other extreme.</font></p>

complain that the weapon proficiencies are too restrictive. But the
real complaint may be that the rules don't allow a character to do
everything the player wants.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, say a player
character is proficient with a long sword. He's about to be
overwhelmed by a horde of kobolds, but he has the sense to retreat.
Unfortunately, he trips over his feet and falls face-first to the
floor! His faithful, trusted long sword skitters from his grip and
the little monsters are upon him. Still full of fight, the character
wrests a short sword from the nearest beastie and begins to do
battle.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At this point, the DM tells
the player to apply the nonproficiency penalty. The player howls in
outrage. &quot;It's a sword,&quot; he moans. &quot;My character can
use a long sword, I can't believe you won't let him use a short
sword! It's the same thing, just smaller!&quot; Before giving in to
the player's protests, consider the differences in what seem to be
similar weapons.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The character's customary
weapon, the long sword, is a slashing weapon. It is three- to
four-feet long, heavy, and balanced toward the blade to increase
momentum in a slash. A short sword is a piercing weapon. It is 12 to
18 inches long, light (for a sword), and balanced with most of the
weight toward the handle for quick reaction.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So, in our example, the
character leaps into the fight using the short sword
instinctively--the way he would use a long sword. He tries to slash,
but the weapon is too short and light for slashing. He tries to block
and parry and finds the weapon absorbs much less impact than his
massive long sword. He tends to attack the air, because he is used to
the reach and sweep of the long sword. He throws himself off balance
by swinging the light weapon too hard. All these minor errors make
him less effective with the short sword, even though it seems similar
to his long sword. The nonproficiency penalty begins to make sense.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Further, weapon proficiencies
are just some of the many factors that must be balanced for a
successful adventure. If a variety of factors combine to give a
character excessive combat bonuses, the DM should create situations
in which that character's favorite weapon is not the best choice.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, a character who
is proficient with all types of swords, but no other weapons, is at a
big disadvantage when confronted by skeletons. His sword is less
effective than a mace. Eventually, the player will have to broaden
his character's weapon proficiencies if he wants to thrive in the
AD&amp;D game world.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes players resort to
&quot;min/maxing&quot; when selecting weapon proficiencies.
Min/maxing occurs when a player calculates all the odds and numerical
advantages and disadvantages of a particular weapon. The player's
decision isn't based on his imagination, the campaign, role-playing,
or character development. It is based on game mechanics--what will
give the player the biggest modifier and cause the most damage in any
situation.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A certain amount of
min/maxing is unavoidable, and even good (it shows that the player is
interested in the game), but an excessive min/maxer is missing the
point. Reducing a character to a list of combat modifiers and dice
rolls is not role-playing.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Fortunately, this type of
player is easy to deal with. Just create a situation in which his
carefully chosen weapon, the one intended to give him an edge over
everyone else, is either useless or puts him at a disadvantage. He
will suddenly discover the drawback of min/maxing. It is impossible
to create a combination of factors that is superior in every
situation, because situations can vary so much.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, a character's lack
of proficiency can be used to create dramatic tension, a vital part
of the game. In the encounter with kobolds described earlier, the
player howled in surprise because the situation suddenly got a lot
more dangerous than he expected it to. The penalty for nonproficiency
increases the risk to the player character, and that increases the
scene's tension.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a nonproficiency penalty
is used to create tension, be sure the odds aren't stacked against
the character too much. Dramatic tension exists only while the player
thinks his character has a chance to escape, even if it's only a slim
chance. If a player decides the situation is hopeless, he will give
up. His reaction will switch from excitement to despair.</font></p>

<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As a convenience for the DM,
non-player characters are assumed to be proficient with the weapons
they carry. However, this need not always be the case. If you want to
make an NPC easier to defeat or less dangerous, rule that he is not
proficient with his weapon. This is most likely the case with simple
innkeepers or townsmen impressed into the militia.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The innkeeper may be adept
with a club (occasionally useful in his trade), but the niceties of
swordplay are not within the normal realm of his business. By adding
to or subtracting from the abilities of an NPC, the game can be
balanced and enriched.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Nonweapon proficiencies are
optional, but, if chosen, can be very useful. If you are uncertain
whether to use these proficiencies, the following points should make
the decision easier:</font></p>

defined by the basic abilities of the character races and classes.
They provide a useful gauge when a character tries to build a boat or
behave properly at court. This frees the DM to think about more
important parts of the story instead of little, perhaps even
insignificant, details.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Not everyone agrees with
this! Some DMs prefer to handle by themselves all the situations
covered by proficiencies. This requires a quick wit and good memory.
In return, the DM is freed from the restraints of rules. He can
create the scene he wants without worrying whether it breaks the
rules. But tread softly here--this is not an easy way to judge a
game! Try this only if you are experienced at DMing or are a
spontaneous and entertaining storyteller.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Nonweapon

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Used cleverly,
they tell the player more about the personality and background of his
character and give him more tools to work with. Applied judiciously
and thoughtfully, nonweapon proficiencies vastly increase a
character's role-playing potential.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Beware, however, because
nonweapon proficiencies can have exactly the opposite effect. They
can become a crutch for players who are unwilling to role-play, an
excuse not to develop a character's personality or history. Some
players decide that proficiencies define everything the character
knows; they make no effort to develop anything else.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Avoid this by encouraging
players to dig deeper and explore the possibilities in their
characters. Ask a player to explain why his character has specific
proficiencies. What did that character do before becoming an
adventurer? Questions like this stimulate players to delve into their
characters' personalities and backgrounds. Make a note of the
player's reasons and then you can use them during play.</font></p>

lists can be tailored to match specific regions or historical
periods, or to define the differences between nationalities.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the characters' home base
is a fishing village, the lists can be altered to allow all
characters to learn swimming, sailing, fishing, and navigation at the
same cost (in proficiency slots). These are common skills among
seafaring people.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the same time, dwarves,
who come to this town from the nearby mountains, must devote extra
slots to learn these proficiencies. A youth spent in dry, solid
tunnels hasn't prepared them for a life at sea. Instead, they can
learn mining, gemcutting, and other stonework skills cheaply.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The proficiency lists in the</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
Player's Handbook</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
are only a beginning. Your campaign will develop a much more
interesting flavor if separate lists are tailored to different
regions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This still leaves the problem
of min/maxing. Players are encouraged to make intelligent and
sensible choices for their characters, but not at the expense of
role-playing. If tailored lists are in use, encourage players to list
the proficiencies they want without getting to see the lists of
proficiencies. Then collect the lists and figure out which
proficiencies the characters can get (some may be unavailable and
others too expensive).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Players will still request
the proficiencies they think are most advantageous, but at least the
selections are drawn partially from the players' imaginations instead
of a list of numbers.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, proficiencies are
only as useful as the DM makes them. Once a decision is made to use
proficiencies in the campaign, the DM must strive to create
situations where they are useful. Always remember to design
encounters, traps, and scenes where proficiencies have a practical
application to the problem at hand. Otherwise, players are going to
write off proficiencies as a waste of time and miss out on a
wonderful chance to expand their characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Ultimately, proficiencies add
much richness, detail, and role-playing to a campaign at only a small
cost in increased complexity. The DM has to remember a few more rules
and the players have to make a few more choices when creating their
characters. But in return, the game is bigger, better, and more fun.</font></p>

Player's Handbook</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
are extensive, but not comprehensive. The proficiencies given are the
ones that characters will most commonly want or need, and those that
have significant, specialized effects worthy of explanation. DMs and
players will certainly think of proficiencies they'd like to add.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Wherever the idea for a new
proficiency comes from, the DM is the person who decides whether to
include it in the game and what its effects are. This is not a
decision for the players, although they can offer suggestions and
advice. Only after a new proficiency is approved by the DM can it be
used in play.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One important factor to
remember is that no proficiency should be beyond the science and
technology of the age. There's no proficiency on the list that allows
a character to build a gasoline engine, and with good reason. A
gasoline engine is far beyond the pseudo-medieval society presented
in the AD&amp;D game.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the same time, this is a
fantasy game filled with magical effects and strange powers. With
magic, it is not impossible to have outlandish and amazing
proficiencies if players and DMs want them. They may have a serious
effect on the game, however, and must be carefully considered.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The majority of new
proficiencies are going to be those related to trades. Most of these
have a very minor game effect, if any at all. They give the character
specialized knowledge, but it is up to the player to make some use of
it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A character with the skills
of a glazier (glass-maker) does not gain a great advantage. Although,
if necessary, he could support himself by making small glass vials
and other items for local mages and adventurers. Still, there might
come a day when knowledge of glass and glass-making becomes vital to
the success of an adventure. A clever player is always looking for a
way to turn knowledge to his advantage.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a player proposes a new
proficiency, have him prepare a description of what the proficiency
entails and allows. Then consider what the character could gain from
it. This is not to say that the player is trying to pull a fast one
(some will, but give them the benefit of the doubt). Instead, it is
useful to imagine ways the proficiency could be abused. If something
horrible or game-busting comes to mind, fix it. Never allow a
proficiency into the game if it seems too powerful.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Make whatever changes are
necessary in the description and then offer it to the player. If he
still likes it (after all the secret powers are stripped out),
introduce it into the game and have fun. Sometimes the only thing
that can be kept is the name of the proficiency. Don't be distressed
by this. Most players will be satisfied with DM changes, content
simply to contribute something to the game.</font></p>

little--money can ruin the fun of your game. Give your characters

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Vigorous trade was done in
goods. Grain, cattle, sheep, wool, jewelry, foodstuffs, and cloth
were all items of value. A canny Venetian merchant would sail from
Venice to England with a load of silks, trading it there for good
English wool (making sure he made a profit), and return to Venice to
sell the wool for another load of goods for England.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Eventually letters of credit
and contracts grew. Now the Venetian merchant could sail to England
to collect wool gathered by contract from a monastery. In return for
their wool shearing for five years, he would guarantee them set
payments in ducats or florins, although he normally brought them
goods they ordered from Venetian merchants--silks, spices, glassware,
or wine. Thus he made a profit from the wool back in Venice and a
profit from buying goods for the English monastery. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	On his return to Venice, the
enterprising merchant would sell his cargo to the wool merchant in
return for a note, and then take this note to a glassmaker and sell
it for a load of valuable Venetian glass.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In time, the notes led to the
rise of banking houses, though much different from the banks we know
today. Intended mainly to finance large deals and serve the wealthy
merchants, there were few controls on these banks. They were
definitely not for the common man. They were not places you stored
your money for a rainy day, but houses that guaranteed the value of a
merchant's note or contract, all for a fee.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Other economies, especially
those of primitive lands, worked entirely on a barter system. What a
man could produce became his money. The farmer paid the miller in
bushels of grain. The miller paid his lord in ground flour. When the
flour was baked into bread, the baker was paid in loaves of bread.
These he could sell for the few coins, fresh eggs, or whatever
luxuries might be available.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	During the Dark Ages even a
man's life could be measured in cows, horses, or sheep. Kill a serf
and you had to pay--perhaps five sheep, some to his lord and some to
his family. The cost for a freedman would be even higher. Rents,
taxes, and fines could be assessed in gold or grain. Eventually
objects were assigned specific values. In parts of medieval Russia,
furs were used almost like coins. Squirrel, ermine, and martin pelts
all had values and were treated just as we treat money today.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As barter systems became more
sophisticated, they included more things. Obligations and duties
became part of the formula. A knight received land from his lord, but
part of his &quot;rent&quot; was the obligation to make himself and a
set number of mounted soldiers available to serve in his lord's
armies for 40 days each year. The serf was obligated to work his
lord's land and live in the same village all his life. You might
adopt an economy like this in your campaign world--one based on
obligations.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For the most part, the
economies of the medieval period were based on a combination of
coins, goods, and services. The knight could escape military service
by paying a special tax to his lord. The king could insist that
foreign merchants acquire goods only through barter. The baker could
be paid a small wage for his services. Generally, changes occurred
slowly as medieval man moved from a barter system to a coin-based
economy. Thus, many different methods existed side-by-side.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Generally, lands near each
other, sharing a common group of people or a common language have
very similar economies. The countries of medieval Europe traded with
each other regularly and so developed very similar coins and values.
Kingdoms also tend to imitate the economy of the most powerful
country in the region. The Byzantine Empire had a stable gold
currency, and its coins were the model for rulers from Baghdad to
Denmark.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The value of a foreign coin
was based on the weight of the coin, but also on the power of the
issuer. The Byzantine besant was not only limited by other lands, but
it was highly valued in trade. An English merchant would accept these
coins from a Venetian trader because he knew their value. His price
might increase if the trader paid him in Persian dinars. To the
merchant, the dinar was simply not as valuable as the besant.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	You can add color to your
campaign by choosing to have different systems of trade in different
lands. By creating different currencies and ways of trading, you make
your players aware of the different kingdoms in your fantasy
campaign. This makes them pay attention and learn about your world. A
traveling merchant who trades in besants becomes a wealthy trader
from the rich lands of Byzantium, while one who deals in hacksilver
is a northerner from the cold shores of Scandinavia. These names and
places create images, images more compelling and exciting than those
created by the plain words &quot;merchant'' or &quot;trader.&quot;</font></p>

can spice them up a bit. People give coins names, whether as plain as
&quot;dime&quot; or lively as &quot;gold double-eagle.&quot; The
imaginary population of a fantasy world should be no different.
Medieval history is filled with different types of coinage, all of
which can add local color to your campaign.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Take, for example, the
situation of a mercenary captain in Aquitaine. Through wages, booty,
and trading he has assembled quite a few coins. Foremost of his horde
are the gold and silver coins of Byzantium--the besant, hyperpyron,
or nomisma as they were known at different times. An Italian general
paid him in coins almost equally valuable, the gold florin and ducat.
Mixed in with these were other coins of the Italian states--silver
grossi and ecu. From the French he collected gros tournois, Rouen
pennies, and louis. A Moorish hostage bought his freedom with silver
drachmas and a German merchant of the Hanse paid the heavy toll of a
gold mark. Part of the spoils of war include solidus aureus and
denarii of Ancient Rome, though these coins are so badly worn their
value has dropped greatly.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One of his men even came
across a horde of hacksilver bracelets! Finally, from his English
employers he received pounds, shillings, and pence. Clearly the
captain is faced with a problem when he tries to figure out just how
much money he has. What do these coins add up to?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The besant, hyperpyron, and
nomisma were the standard coins of the Byzantine Empire. They were of
a regular size and the precious metal was not debased with lead or
copper. Backed by the power of the Emperor, each coin had a steady
value. In your game, you could establish their value at one or two
gold pieces each.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The florin and the ducat were
the coins of different Italian states. These lands, rising in trading
power, needed a steady economy. Thus their coins were almost the
equal of the besant and were used for trade throughout Europe. Each
florin might be equal to a gold piece. The gross was a silver penny
and, normally, 12 equalled one florin.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The coins of France were much
like those of Italy and could be valued the same way. The louis and
the sous were the equal of the florin while the gros tournis and the
denarius were silver pennies. However, the Rouen penny was specially
minted and not considered as valuable by most traders.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The Middle Eastern drachma
was modeled on the besant. Normally 12 to 20 were equal to a single
besant (6-10 would equal one gp) but in Aquitaine they were often
valued just like other silver pennies. The gold mark wasn't so much a
coin as a measure. It was normally figured to be worth six English
pounds. There were also silver marks worth about 13 shillings, and
Scandinavian ora worth 16 pence. But the true value of these coins
was what you could get for them.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The English coins included
the rarely seen pound, equal perhaps to one gp. More common were
silver shillings, officially figured at 20 to a pound (or half a sp).
Below the shilling was the pence, 12 to a shilling, and below the
pence was the farthing, four to a pence. Meanwhile, the lowly Rouen
penny was figured to be equal to half a pence.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of the ancient coins, the
Roman solidus aureus was the model for the besant and thus nearly all
other coins. It in turn was divided into silver denarii with 12 to 40
equaling a single solidus. However, age and counterfeiters reduced
the value of these coins so much that their only true worth could be
found in what they weighed. During the same time, Scandinavians used
hacksilver--silver jewelry. When they needed to pay, they could cut
off a chunk from an armband or bracelet and weigh it, thus the name
hacksilver. They literally wore their money!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Clearly, money is no simple,
universal thing. Each nation and each time has its own coins with its
own values. Your player characters may travel through many different
lands and find long-lost treasures. It will be much more exciting for
your characters to find 600 ancient tremissa from the rule of Emperor
Otto 400 years before than to find yet another 600 silver pieces.
With a little imagination and research at your local library, you can
find many different examples to add to your campaign.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As exciting and important as
money is for player characters, tracing day-to-day expenses just
isn't very interesting. Forcing players to record every purchase
their characters make is time-consuming and, plainly put, not very
heroic. It's better simply to charge player characters a monthly
living expense.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This living expense covers
all normal room and board charges whenever a character is operating
out of his home base. Separate charges for meals and beds need be
made only when the character is traveling away from home.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Players describe how well (or
poorly) they want their characters to live. From this the DM decides
if they are living in squalid, poor, middle-class, or wealthy
surroundings. The Player Character Living Expenses table, below,
gives estimated base costs for each category.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Squalid and poor living
conditions cost the same for all characters regardless of race or
level. However, as a character increases in level, his needs increase
according to (or beyond) his means. Characters living middle-class or
wealthy lifestyles multiply the base living expense by their level to
determine the cost. Characters of races other than the predominant
one of the area (e.g., dwarves in a human city or humans in an elven
village) pay double the normal rate. This is due to suspicion and a
scarcity of goods the character is accustomed to.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The only direct game effect
of living conditions is the expense involved, but living conditions
can also determine some role-playing events and conditions in your
game. Your player characters' lifestyles even can be used as a
starting point for many different types of adventures.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Dirty straw in leaky stables,
muck-floored huts outside the walls of town, contempt, and random
violence--these typify squalid living conditions. Characters living
like this aren't likely to be robbed (since no one thinks they have
any money), but they may be tormented or attacked just for the fun of
it. Their legal protections will be few indeed.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Middle-class life tends to be

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes you discover you
have given the player characters too much money. While living
expenses will take a little of that (especially if the characters
live big), it doesn't come close to solving the problem. Fortunately,
there are other ways you can get money out of their hands.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A wide variety of taxes was
applied during the Middle Ages. Some caused minimal hardship while
others were quite expensive. Characters could be forced to pay a
weregeld, a fine paid to the relatives of someone they have slain.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The king could demand
scutage, a fee to avoid military service. Special assessments could
be made to repair roads or rebuild bridges. There could be minor
taxes to enter towns on market days or wander through the streets as
a strolling minstrel. Taxes could be charged according to the size of
the person's household.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition to taxes, there
might be other unexpected costs. A fire could sweep through the
character's manor, requiring a costly repair program. Termites could
wreak havoc with the character's fleet. The local lord could assess
his vassals a share of the tribute he must pay the enemy. Magical
mysteries and daring thefts can also lower a character's financial
position.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Always find a different,
totally unexpected approach to taking excess cash from player
characters. Let them defeat some of your attempts to drain their
coffers. Set up some of your money-removing attempts to fail from the
start--if the player characters take some action. Turn your attempts
into adventures. If a thief robs the player character's castle, be
ready with an adventure where the character can try to track him
down. In fact, he may even catch the thief, but only after the
scoundrel has squandered the character's fortune!</font></p>

the Equipment Lists</font></font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The items listed in the</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
Player's Handbook </i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">are
by no means the only things ever made in the world--or even in a
medieval fantasy setting. They are listed because they are the most
likely things the characters will need. However, you can certainly
add missing or player-requested items to this list.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When you add an item to the
lists, first consider the reasonableness of its presence. Given the
setting of the AD&amp;D game, adding an M4 Sherman tank as a regular
item of equipment is just not a logical, sensible, or wise thing to
do.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once you decide that a new
item is reasonable, you must assign it a cost. Use your judgment.
Consider the intricacy of the item, the craftsmanship required to
make it, and the cost of similar items already on the lists. From
these, you should be able to assign an appropriate price.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If, later on, you discover
you made the item too cheap and all the characters are buying one,
raise the price and say suppliers can't keep up with the demand. If
an item is too expensive, you can lower the price and no one will
complain.</font></p>

Prices</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Remember that the prices
listed in the</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
Player's Handbook</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
are not absolute. There is no reason you can't raise or lower the
price of any item on the equipment lists. Demand can increase or
decrease a price. Different lands in your campaign may be known for
specific goods, allowing them to charge more.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even in the Middle Ages,
Spain and the Middle East were known for steel, Germany for beer,
France for wine, England for wool, and the Italy for armor. These
reputations allowed higher prices to be charged for these goods,
especially finished items.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Greed can also raise prices.
Merchants live to make money, so they will normally charge what they
can get away with. There were very few price controls or regulating
agencies during these times.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, adventurers tend to
disrupt local economies, suddenly bringing in large amounts of cash.
Merchants raise prices to match. Situations not unlike the Klondike
gold rush develop, in which even the simplest items cost outrageous
amounts. In short, don't be afraid to charge characters as much as
you think you can get away with. If they don't like the prices,
they'll find some way to let the merchant know of their
dissatisfaction.</font></p>

your campaign is set in a generic medieval fantasy world. In
practical terms, this means you haven't tied your campaign to any
particular date in history. All this is perfectly fine and is
commonly done in fantasy stories and fantasy campaigns--you are
dealing with fantasy, after all.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, it is also possible
to create exciting and interesting campaigns that are tied to
specific time periods, but this will work only if you know something
about the time period. This is important! A lot of people assume
things about the past without knowing the facts. The truth of the
matter may be far different. Go to the library and do your homework
before you begin designing a time-specific campaign. Even if you
don't do such a campaign, it's useful to learn a little more about
medieval history. It will only improve your own fantasy world.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It is not necessary to pick a
precise date to model, such as 1237 A.D., although again there is
nothing wrong with this. History and historians tend to divide the
past into different ages, and you can do the same. Four different
ages are covered here--the Ancient World, the Dark Ages, the Middle
Ages, and the Renaissance. Each has its peculiarities and
differences, some of which are described below.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This covers a period of great
empires spreading from the Mediterranean. Some weapons and armor were
made of bronze, others of iron, and a few were made of steel. Most
household items were pottery, wood, stone, and wicker. Bronze weapons
were easily dulled and, in game terms, break or bend when a &quot;1&quot;
is rolled on the attack roll. Stirrups hadn't been invented, so
characters can't use heavy lances, and charge attacks can't be made
with normal lances.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This was the period after the
collapse of the Roman Empire, from 450 A.D. to about 1100 A.D. While
much of the learning and culture of the ancient world was lost, it
was not as bleak and ignorant a period as some believe. Still, in
many ways, it was a step backward from the previous age. During this
time the stirrup was introduced, allowing riders to gain full use of
the lance.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">The

<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The Middle Ages (roughly from
1100 to 1450) is the period in which most fantasy campaigns are set.
It was the period most people associate with knighthood and chivalry.
The knights went off on the Crusades. Great stone castles were built.
The role of traders and merchants began to grow. Virtually all the
items on the equipment list were available in this time period.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The latest time period that
should be considered as a setting for a normal AD&amp;D campaign, the
Renaissance was a time of great change. The collapse of the feudal
system had begun throughout much of Europe. There was great growth in
literature, art, and science. The power of the old nobility began to
decline while the influence and wealth of merchants and businessmen
continued to grow. Gunpowder and simple guns revolutionized the face
of warfare. Foot soldiers became more important than cavalry, and
armor was not nearly as useful as it once had been.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When you set your campaign in
a specific time period, you might want to adjust the equipment lists
to reflect changes in availability and price. Some suggested changes
are listed in Table 23. Like the capsule descriptions, the table is
not 100% accurate. Instead, it reflects whether items were commonly
used in the time period. For example, flails (as an agricultural
instrument) have existed for time immemorial. However, they were not
commonly used as weapons in most time periods, except in cases of
emergency. By doing further research, you can refine and expand this
list.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Most of the equipment a
character buys is assumed to be of average quality--neither too
cheaply made nor too elaborate. Thus, weapons are serviceable with
stout hafts and sturdy blades. The metal is not so poorly tempered as
to make the blade hopelessly brittle. The blade is not elaborately
etched and the hilt is not encrusted with gold. Other items are of
everyday make, usefulness and function superseding artistic needs.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, quality can vary
from item to item. For some items it is important to know the
quality, since this affects a game ability. The three items where
quality is most significant are locks, horses, and weapons. In other
instances, quality becomes important only if you or one of your
players wants an item of exceptional beauty or of exceptionally
shoddy construction.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The quality of a lock can
increase, decrease, or leave unchanged a thief's chance of picking
that lock. The higher the quality of the lock, the harder it is for
the thief to pick. Table 24 lists the different lock qualities and
the amount they add or subtract from a thief's percentage chance to
open it. Unless otherwise noted, assume that all locks are of good
quality.</font></p>

be discerned just by looking at it. Indeed, one of the tricks of the

it in a cheap-looking case. A thief can learn the quality of a lock
by attempting to pick it. This attempt need not be successful (&quot;Gee,
this lock must be a really superior job. It's a lot harder than it
looks.&quot;)</font></p>

is important is in horseflesh. There is a world of difference between
a high-spirited stallion and a broken-down nag. And it is not always
apparent to the eye, although it is usually pretty easy to tell a
scrawny, sway-backed old mare from a fiery stallion. Buying of a
horse is something the player characters should always approach with
care, lest some unscrupulous horse merchant pull a fast one on them.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Further, horses often have
irritating traits that can make them less than pleasant to be around.

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Biters tend to take nips at
their riders or those leading them, an uncomfortable but not
dangerous habit. Kickers never seem to lash out on command, but only
when a character doesn't want it to happen. The best idea is not to
follow a kicker too closely. Fence-chewers are similar to biters
except that they seem to have a taste for wood instead of their
rider. While fence-chewing may be caused by a bad diet, it's a hard
habit to break.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some horses have a seemingly
malicious tendency to step on feet as they are being saddled and
groomed--and then they refuse to move. Some refuse to gallop unless
forced. Some stubborn horses just stop in the middle of a march and
almost have to be dragged forward. Others take an almost human
pleasure in rubbing against fences, walls, and trees trying to scrape
their rider off. Bucking</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">horses are always unpleasant,
though at least the rider can usually feel the horse tense up just
before it happens.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Untrained horses, even those
broken for riding, haven't learned the basic commands of
horsemanship--left, right, speed up, or slow down. They do what they
think they are supposed to, but that isn't always right.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some, while trained, are just
plain headstrong and, figuring they know more than their riders, try
to do what they want. Single-rider horses have been trained too well,
recognizing only a single master. With time they can be ridden by a
new owner, but they will not respond well to others, even friends of
the owner. On rare occasions a horse may actually know a minor trick,
usually learned without special training. These tricks are very
simple--to come when whistled for, to rear on a tug of the reins, or
to turn when the rider presses with his knees.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Particularly lively horses
have their own special quirks. Some just cannot seem to move at a
slow steady pace. Every step is a jolting, bouncing bone-jarring
ride. Others are born leapers, making corrals and fences only an
occasional barrier. An ill-tempered few will rear suddenly at the
most surprising moments, especially in the midst of combat. When the
horse does this, it is not attacking so much as reacting in fear and
surprise. Many a rider has been dumped by this sudden move.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Risks of
Horse Buying</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Beyond just the quality and
quirks of horses, there are other reasons to be careful when buying a
horse. Horse theft always has been a popular pastime, and punishments
are often equally severe for both the thief and the buyer--assuming,
of course, that the buyer isn't mistaken for the thief. Unscrupulous
merchants often try to pass horses off as what they are not (&quot;Yeah,
this is a heavy war horse, really it is.&quot;) Horses may not be
trained, although merchants always claim they are. While it is easy
to spot a horse not broken to the saddle, it's not so simple to tell
if a horse has been trained for war.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Characters with the riding
proficiency can avoid many of the hazards of horse-buying on a
successful proficiency check. The character must choose to use the
proficiency (but considering the investment he would be foolish not
to). A successful roll will reveal a horse's true quality and perhaps
some of its obvious quirks. Naturally, there is no way to ascertain
the origin of the mount, unless you decide the horse has been branded
or marked in some way. Even this may not be foolproof, since clever
thieves can find ways to alter virtually any marking.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Weapon
Quality</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Quality weapons are those of
exceptionally fine craftsmanship. The blade may be forged from the
finest steel for flexibility and sharpness. The swordsmith may have
carefully folded, hammered, and tempered the steel to a superb edge.
The whole sword may be perfectly balanced, light in the hand, but
heavy in the blow. There are many reasons why a sword or other weapon
could be above average.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Careful craftsmanship and
high quality give a weapon a bonus on the chance to hit or a bonus to
damage. The bonus should never be more than +1. The bonus on the
chance to hit is for those weapons that are exceptionally
well-balanced, light, or quick. Weapons of perfectly tempered steel
or carefully hammered blades gain the bonus to damage. The metal
retains its razor sharpness, cleaving through armor like a hot needle
through wax. Because they rely on mass and impact, bludgeoning
weapons rarely gain a bonus to damage. Those that do get a bonus are
because they have carefully shaped and balanced heads.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The quality of a weapon is
not immediately apparent to the average person. While anyone using
the weapon gets the quality bonus (even if they don't realize it),
only those proficient in that weapon-type or proficient in
weaponsmithing can immediately recognize the true craftsmanship that
went into the making of the weapon.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even then, the character must
handle the weapon to appreciate its true value. For some reason,
however, merchants almost always seem to know the value of their
goods (at least the successful merchants do). Thus, weapons of
quality cost from 5 to 20 times more than normal.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In your campaign, you might
want to create NPCs or regions known for their fine quality weapons.
Just as Damascus steel was valued in the real world for its fine
strength and flexibility, a given kingdom, city, or village may be
noted for the production of swords or other weapons. The mark of a
specific swordsmith and his apprentices can be a sure sign of
quality. Again, by introducing one or two of these (remote and
difficult to reach) areas into your campaign, you increase the depth
and detail of your world.</font></p>

<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	While ornamentation has no
effect on the function of an item, it does increase the cost.
Ornamented items can also enhance the status of the owner as a man of
wealth and influence. Of course, it also marks the character as a
target for thieves and robbers.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Among the more popular types
of ornamentation are jeweled mountings, engraving, embossing,
inlaying, painting, plating, chiseling, chasing, etching, enameling,
lacquering, carving, and gilding. Common items also can be made from
rare and fantastic materials--perhaps as simple as silk or the
wonderfully rare and incredibly supple hides of baby dragons. The
cost of such items depends on the difficulty and skill of the work.
It is best for you to decide a price (highly inflated over the
original), although 10 times the normal cost can be used as a
starting figure.</font></p>

damage isn't applied to equipment under the AD&amp;D rules. This
doesn't mean that equipment is never damaged or broken. Instead, it
is assumed that whatever normal wear and tear an item may suffer

the player characters or your NPCs will want to cut a rope, snap a

to achieve a specific effect. There are two ways such an attack can
be made. the first is to attack a specific point or area with a
weapon--slashing the rope that holds the heavy curtain up. The second
is an attack that strikes everything in a given area with
considerable force--a boulder landing on a character's backpack. The
first attack uses Armor Class and hit points of damage. The second
attack uses a saving throw.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a character tries to
damage a specific part of an item, use common sense to determine the
effect a particular weapon will have against certain materials.
Trying to cut open a sack with a mace is futile. Trying to chop down
a door with a dagger is equally futile (unless the character has a
lot of time). Be sure you consider the hardness of the item and the
amount of time the character has. A mace can be used to batter down a
wooden door, but an ax will be faster. An ax won't do much of
anything to a stone wall.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the character has an
appropriate weapon, determine the Armor Class of the item. This may
be as broad as &quot;can't miss&quot; or as precise as a specific
Armor Class value.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Players don't have to roll to
see if they hit some items. Can't-miss items include large non-moving
objects that characters attack with melee weapons--doors, barrels,
and backpacks laying on the floor. Other can't-miss situations
include missile weapon attacks against huge objects (those big enough
to fill a character's field of vision, like the proverbial broad side
of a barn.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some attacks require an
attack roll (throwing a mug at a full-length mirror, for example). In
cases like this, assign an Armor Class to the target, taking into
consideration the size, movement, and hardness of the object. A
wooden pole has a minimum AC of 7. A metal rod of about the same
thickness has an AC of 0. A rope has an AC of 6, better than a wooden
pole because the rope is more resilient and less brittle. If the
object is small or moving, the AC should be better. A flailing rope
becomes AC 3 or 4. Smashing a small vial as it rolls on the floor
could be AC 2 or 1.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, when attempting to
hit a very specific spot, the additional penalty for a called shot
must be applied. Shooting at the bulls-eye of a target or slitting
the backpack of an enemy in combat are difficult feats because of the
precision needed.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	You must also decide how much
damage the item can take before it is broken. Table 28 gives the
standard range for some common items and materials. The final column
on the table lists the types of attack most likely to cause damage to
the item, although other types may also be effective. Using these as
guidelines, you can decide the number of hit points to assign to most
materials.</font></p>

Saving Throws</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When weapons are subjected to
a general danger--the flames of a fireball, the icy chill of a cold
ray, or the smashing blow of a giant's boulder--the roll to hit and
hit points do not apply. Instead, the following Item Saving Throw
table is used. This saving throw represents an item's general ability
to withstand the effects of the attack. It is rolled just like a
normal saving throw (see &quot;Combat&quot;).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The item saving throw should
be used only when the item is not being carried by a character or
when a character fails his saving throw against the same attack. A
character who successfully saves against the blast of a</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
fireball</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell need
not make separate saving throws for his potions. The character who
failed the same save failed to protect himself adequately and must
therefore check for his potions (and probably his scrolls, too). Not
all items need make a save in every instance. It is perfectly
reasonable to ignore the save for a character's sword and armor in
the same fireball situation described above, since there is so little
chance that these will be affected.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, magical items
are more resistant to damage, gaining bonuses to the saving throw.
Items with a plus (a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>sword
+1</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">, for example)
gain that plus as a bonus to the die roll. If the item possesses
additional special abilities, it should have an extra plus for each
of these. Magical items with no stated pluses should gain a bonus
relative to their power. A potion would have a +1 while a
miscellaneous magical item could have a +5 or +6. Further, if the
saving throw is versus an attack the device was designed to counter
(e.g., extreme cold vs. a</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
ring of warmth</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">), an
additional bonus of +2 is allowed.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The simplest way to give a
wizard spells is to throw the ball back into the player's court--ask
him what spells he would like. As he names a spell, have him roll to
see if his character can learn it. If he can, the player writes the
spell on his character sheet. If he can't, one of you should note
that he cannot learn that spell.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Keep doing this until all the
1st-level spells have been checked or until the character reaches the
maximum number of spells his character is allowed to learn (depending
on the character's Intelligence). This allows the player to get the
spells he wants for his character, which usually makes the player
happy. However, it has some drawbacks.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	First, players tend to pick
the spells they consider the most powerful. While this is not bad if
you have only one or two wizards, a whole horde of the fellows, all
with identical spells, gets pretty boring.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There is also a chance the
character will overlook some basic spells he really needs to function

the character will hardly get any spells. And, while there is no
minimum number of spells a character must know, a wizard without
spells is hardly the type of character a player wants. If this
happens, give the poor player a break and allow him to make some
second checks on spells until you believe he has an adequate number.</font></p>

it), pay NPC wizards for the privilege (see Chapter 12: NPCs), or

must roll to see if the character can learn the spell. No character

it, the wizard can return to his old mentor and, with luck, copy a
few spells out of his master's spell book. Use this method if, and
only if, you feel it is important for player characters to have more
than a few new spells each time they advance to a new spell level.
Allow the characters to gain too much this way, or too frequently,
and they will come to rely upon it, not using their own playing
ability to develop their characters.</font></p>

Control of Spell Acquisition</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However characters acquire
new spells, always remember that you are in charge. You have complete
control over what spells the player characters get.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a player character has a
spell you don't like or one that severely disrupts or unbalances your
game, it is not the player's fault. Who gave the character the spell?
Who allowed it in the game? Controlling spell acquisition is an
important responsibility. Consider your choices carefully.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	By keeping the selection of
spells limited, you automatically increase their importance and value
to the wizards in your campaign. A simple scroll with a single spell
becomes a real treasure if it has a spell on it the wizard has never
seen. This gives the player a touch choice. Should he cast the scroll
during an adventure where it might be useful? Should he save it until
he can take the time to research the spell for his spell books?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When the characters overcome
a hostile mage, the first concern of the wizard will be for his spell
book. Where is it? What spells does it have in it? Even a nonmagical
item like a spell book becomes very important. Knowing their value,
NPC wizards will go to great pains to protect their own spell books,
hiding them carefully, locking them in trapped chests, and scattering
magical traps throughout the pages.</font></p>

<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A wizard's most important
treasure is his spell book. Because it is so important, you and the
players need to know some basics about it. What exactly is a spell
book? How many pages does it have? What is it made of?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">All
Sizes and Shapes</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There is no standard size or
shape for a spell book. A player character can't walk into a wizard's
lab or study and instantly spot the spell book because it is the
biggest, longest, fattest, squarest, roundest, or thinnest book
there. Neither can he measure all the books to find the one that
conforms to the dimensions of a spell book. The spell book's size and
shape is determined largely by the culture of the wizard who owns it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Consider, for example, the
book you are reading right now. How would one of these pages have
appeared in other times and places? In medieval Europe, this page
would most likely have been 10 or more hand-lettered sheets of
parchment, perhaps embellished with illuminations and painted scenes.
In ancient China, this page would have been several hand-printed
pages on colored paper and bound with red lacings. The Egyptians
would have used a rolled scroll of papyrus, with several required to
make a book. Even more cumbersome, the ancient Babylonians would have
used clay tables marked in cuneiform and dried. American Indians
would have written it on leaves of birch bark or painted it on a
cured buffalo hide.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Writing and written works
have changed greatly through the centuries of Earth history. A
fantasy game world is no different. Spell books should come in a
variety of shapes and forms--whatever seems best for the campaign.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A spell book may be a heavy
tome, bound in leather with crisp parchment pages. It may be a
collection of papyrus scrolls tied with red silk strings. It might be
a pile of clay tables marked in cuneiform, or a cheap-looking folio
printed on linen rag paper. It even could be thin sheets of embossed
gold between covers made from the hide of a naga.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If you don't want to create a
unique spell book for your campaign world, here's one standard you
can fall back on: Compare them to bulky coffee-table books of today
or large, hefty dictionaries. Even if you do create unique spell
books, this standard should give you some idea of the appropriate
size and bulk.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Often a wizard's complete set
of spell books occupies several shelves of his library, especially
when the character reaches the highest levels. At this point, it is
no longer practical for the character to carry all of his spell books
with him when he travels. Therefore, many wizards opt to make
traveling spell books.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The traveling spell book is a
more selective, more portable version of the character's complete
spell books (although there is little that can be done to make clay
tablets portable). In the traveling spell book, the wizard places
only those spells he believes he will need while traveling.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There is no limitation on
which spells can be included, but a traveling spell book has a
limited number of pages. Thus, a high-level wizard may need several
traveling spell books to contain all the spells he thinks are
necessary.</font></p>

Book Preparation</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The books themselves require
few special materials, but the workmanship must be exact, flawless.
Even the slightest mistake in copying a spell ruins it. This is not
work for a common scribe.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Compounding the problem, the
bizarre formulas and diagrams found in a spell book can't be
reproduced by normal medieval printing methods. Spell book work must
be done slowly and laboriously by hand. The standard amount of time
required to prepare a spell book is one to two days of work per spell
level of the spell being entered.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Occasionally, prepared spell
books can be found for sale, but few wizards choose to trust the
success or failure of their magical efforts to the work of others.
Rare is the wizard who doesn't prepare his own spell books.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Materials used in a spell
book must be of the highest quality. No wizard wants to run the risk
of dampness causing his ink to run, a blot on the parchment causing a
spell to be misinterpreted, bookworms making a feast of page six, the
wind blowing a loose page away, or a spilled retort turning the whole
book into a sodden mass.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Careful treatment, common
sense, and quality materials are essential to prevent these
disasters. Strong bindings or cases are used to protect the
interiors. Clear sheets are needed to record the spells. The best
bold inks and the sharpest pens must be used for writing. Aromatic
compounds are recommended to deter bookworms and moths, while other
preparations should be used to protect against mold, mildew, and dry
rot. All this costs money.</font></p>

Book Cost</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The one thing all spell books
have in common is their cost. Books are never cheap, and a wizard's
spell books are more expensive than most.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For the materials and their
preparation, the wizard must pay 50 gp per page. Traveling spell
books, which are even more compact, cost 100 gp per page.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">How Many
Pages in a Spell Book?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Each spell requires a number
of pages equal to its level plus 0-5 (1d6-1) additional pages. The
actual number of pages a spell takes differs for each wizard. Even if
two or more wizards are recording the same spell, the number of pages
varies, since there are differences in handwriting and notations.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Further, no spell book can
have more than 100 pages, no ordinary non-magical scroll more than
25, and no traveling spell book more than 50. Thus, at best, a spell
book filled with 9th-level spells could only hold 11 spells (99
pages), allowing only one blank page to hold a magical protection
(such as a</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i> firetrap</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell). All too likely, this spell book would be filled well before
11 spells had been entered.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For convenience in creating
NPC spell books, the maximum and minimum number of spells for each
level and type of spell book is given in Table 30. The table presumes
that all the spells within a book are of the same level (which may or
may not be the case, especially for traveling books).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition, although a spell
book never can have more than its maximum at a given spell level,
there is no requirement that the book be filled even to its minimum
number. The ranges given on the following table presume the spell
book is filled as efficiently as possible with spells, leaving little
or no room for protective devices.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Currently, the different
schools of wizard magic are merely sketched out and very lightly
defined. The different schools can be used as described, but they
lack detail and, in a few cases, a full range of spells. There are,
for example, very few necromantic spells, thus discouraging player
characters from being necromancer specialists. There is nothing wrong
in this--nothing requires schools of magic to be equal. However, you
might want to customize and expand the schools of magic to suit your

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A school can be expanded
simply by adding new spells. The necromantic specialization could be
made more appealing if a complete spell list were created. Be careful
that the new spells don't make the school too powerful. In the case
of the necromantic school, the first reaction is to add some of the
priest healing spells. However, this takes from the role of the
cleric and makes the necromantic specialist too powerful. In the long
run, it's probably better to create new necromantic spells, spells
that do not involve healing or do so only in a minor way. Careful
judgment must be applied when adding new spells.</font></p>

choice is left to individual DMs.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One possibility is that
wizards learn their specialties without formal training. Materros the
Necromancer has a natural curiosity about necromantic spells, so he
specializes in them.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Another possibility is that
there are formal colleges or academies where spells are taught. These
institutions would have their own hierarchies, traditions,
regulations, and procedures.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, Materros the
Necromancer could be a brother of the Cabal of Thar-Zad, a
necromantic society. As a sign of his standing high within its
hierarchy, he is allowed to wear the red and green robes of a master.
Of course, when he wears these, his occupation is easily identified
by those who know something of the Cabal. This is not all bad, since
the Cabal of Thar-Zad has a reputation as a dangerous and mean bunch.
By adding such details, the DM brings his campaign to life. He can
make a seemingly limited magical school more appealing to players.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One of the most overlooked
assets of the wizard or priest is the ability to research new spells.
In the hands of a clever player, this ability results in powerful and
unique player characters. Since the player has to get involved to
make the research rules work, it is also an excellent method for
getting player ideas into the campaign. However, since there are so
many different possibilities in spell research, there are few set
rules. Use the following as guidelines when faced with magical

something the DM does without player input--or vice versa. The first
step is for the player to decide what he wants his character to

suggested spell, talk it over with him. What does the player really
want to accomplish? Is this the same as what he claims the spell will
do? Sometimes what is written for a spell description and what was
intended are two different things. This should become clear in
talking to the player.</font></p>

exists in the character's group that does the same thing, no research
should be allowed. If the new spell is a combination of several
spells or a more powerful version of a weaker spell, it can be
allowed, although it will be difficult to research. Weaker versions
of a more powerful spell are certainly possible.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In their desire to have their

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Never immediately approve a
spell when it is first presented. Take the spell description and
consider all the ways it could be abused. If some glaring misuse
becomes apparent, fix the spell so this cannot happen. Keep doing
this until all the obvious problems and abuses have been fixed. The
player should then have a chance to look at all the changes in his
spell. After all, once the DM has finished with it, the player may no

by comparing the spell to already existing ones.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the spell inflicts damage,
its level should be within one or two of the number of dice of damage
it causes--thus a spell which inflicts 5d6 points of damage should be
about 3rd to 5th level.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the spell is an
improvement of an existing spell, it should be at least two levels
greater than that spell. If the spell is one of the other group (a
priest researching a wizard's spell), it always should be at a higher
level than it is in its natural group. Quite often it will also be
less effective than the spell that inspired it.</font></p>

only by your imagination, but should be tempered by the spell's power

simple components. Indeed, one important type of spell research is to
create a powerful spell with little in the way of components.</font></p>

adventuring while undertaking the study. During research, wizards
study over old manuscripts and priests work at their devotions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The minimum amount of time
needed to research a spell is two weeks per spell level. At the end
of this time, a check is made. For wizards, this is the same as their

For priests a Wisdom check is made.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Research also costs money. If
the character has access to a wizard's laboratory or an appropriate
place of worship, the cost of research is 100-1,000 gp per spell
level. The DM can choose the actual cost or determine it randomly.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It is best to base the cost
on whatever the character can just barely afford (or slightly more).
As such, the cost of research may vary greatly from campaign to
campaign.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Research costs are a very
important incentive for player characters to go on adventures,
gathering funds to support their studies. And, of course, a wizard
who lacks a laboratory must come up with the cost of assembling one.
Again, the cost of this should be just beyond what the player
character can currently afford, perhaps 1,000 to 10,000 gp. Once the
laboratory is assembled, it remains as part of the character's
possessions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Priests who lack a proper
place of worship can pay a similar cost (in donations or whatever) to
prepare a small household shrine. Neither the laboratory nor the
shrine is particularly portable.</font></p>

New Spell to the Spell Book</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Once a character has
successfully researched a spell, it is added to his spell lists or
spell books. Once researched, the spell is treated like a normal
spell. The player character can choose to share the spell with others
(although other wizards must roll to learn the spell) or keep it to
himself.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some DMs and players feel it
is unfair that a wizard can't research a spell simply because he has
as many spells of a particular level as he is allowed to have. The DM
can allow a wizard to have spells in his spell book beyond the
maximum allowed by the character's Intelligence--provided that
character goes to the trouble of researching new spells.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All the standard rules for
spell research apply. In addition, the DM should allow only those new
spells that the player himself has created. Players cannot use this
as an excuse to add a spell they would otherwise not be able to
learn.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, say a player
character has failed to learn the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>fireball</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell before his book is filled. Although the player can still
research and add new spells, he cannot do so for a fireball-type
spell that inflicts 1d4 points of damage per level.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The spells researched must be
new and original--this forces players to be creative and involved.
Beyond these restrictions, there is no limit to the number of spells
a character can research at a given level.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Awarding experience points
(XP) is one of the DM's most difficult jobs. The job is difficult
because there are only a few rules (and a lot of guidelines) for the
DM to rely on. The DM must learn nearly everything he knows about
experience points from running game sessions. There is no magical
formula or die roll to determine if he is doing the right or wrong
thing. Only time, instinct, and player reactions will tell.</font></p>

Importance of Experience</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It is often said that the
AD&amp;D game is not a &quot;winners-and-losers&quot; game. This is
true. The AD&amp;D game is not a game in which one player wins at the
expense of the others. But at the same time there is winning and
losing, based on how well the group plays and how well it achieves
the goals set for it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This does not mean that
individuals in the group compete against each other (winning and
losing) or that different groups of players compete against each
other (as in football). If anything, an AD&amp;D game player competes
against himself. He tries to improve his role-playing and to develop
his character every time he plays.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Experience points are a
measure of this improvement, and the number of points given a player
for a game session is a signal of how well the DM thinks the player
did in the game--a reward for good role-playing. As with any other
reward system, there are potential problems.</font></p>

<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Too
Little or Too Much?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the DM consistently gives
too little experience to players, they become frustrated. Frustrated
players don't have fun and, usually, quit the game. Even if they
don't quit, players can develop an
&quot;It-doesn't-matter-what-I-do-so-why-bother&quot; attitude. They
stop trying to do their best, figuring they will only get a measly
amount of experience whether they play their best or just coast
along.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	On the other hand, players
can be given too many experience points too quickly. Players in this
situation develop an
&quot;It-doesn't-matter-what-I-do-because-I'm-going-to-win&quot;
attitude. They quit trying to be inventive and clever, and they just
get by.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Consequently, the DM must
take care not to give characters too little experience or too much.
The best approach is to vary the awards given from game to game,
based on the actions of the characters. Players should be rewarded
according to how hard they try and how well they accomplish various
goals.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Every game session should
have a goal. Some goals are constant, applicable to any AD&amp;D
game. Others are dependent on the individual campaign, storyline,
character levels, and specific adventure. All goals should be clear,
understandable ones that players can see or decipher from clues they
get during play.</font></p>

<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Three goals are
constant--fun, character survival, and improvement. Each of these
should be possible in a single game session.</font></p>

<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Everyone gathered around an
AD&amp;D game table is playing a game. Games are entertainment, and
entertainment is supposed to be fun. If the players don't have a good
time playing in AD&amp;D game sessions, it shows.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Therefore, one of the goals
of the AD&amp;D game is to have fun. Much of the pressure to provide
this elusive quality rests on the DM's shoulders, but the players can
also contribute. When they do, players should be rewarded with
experience points since they are making the game a good experience
for all. The DM who doles out awards for adding to the fun will find
more players making the effort to contribute.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To give out experience points
for fun the DM should consider the following:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>1.
Did the player actively get involved in the game? </b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A
player who does nothing but tell one funny joke during the course of
the game isn't really participating. The DM should be careful,
however, not to penalize players who are naturally shy. Involvement
should be measured against a player's personality.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>2.

expense? </b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
second is not really deserving of any reward.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>3.

</b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This is

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>4.
Was the player argumentative or a &quot;rules lawyer?&quot; </b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">These
are players who can quote every rule in the game and try to use even
the most obscure rules to their advantage, often to the detriment of
the spirit of the game. This is definitely not fun for the DM, but
the DM should allow a reasonable amount of disagreement with his
decisions. Players will want (and should be allowed) to argue their
views from time to time. However, rules arguments properly belong
outside the actual game session. The DM should make a ruling for the
moment and then hear appeals to his decision after the adventure.
This way the game is not interrupted.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Character
Survival</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although having a character
live from game session to game session is a reward in itself, a
player should also receive experience points when his character
survives. Since there are many ways to bring a dead character back
into the game, the threat of death, while present, loses some of its
sting. Players should be encouraged to try to keep their characters
alive, instead of relying on resurrections and wishes. To this end, a
small reward for making it through a game session is useful. It is a
direct way of telling a player that he played well.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The amount given for survival
should be balanced against what happened during the adventure. Player
characters who survived because they did nothing dangerous or who
have so many powers and hit points that they're nearly invulnerable
do not deserve as many experience points as the character who
survived sure death through the use of his wits. Likewise, characters
who survived by sheer luck deserve less than those who survived
because of sound strategy and tactics.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Improvement</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Experience points are one
measure of a character's improvement, and they translate directly
into game mechanics. However, players should also improve by trying
to play more intelligently at each session. As the players learn more
about the game, the campaign, and role-playing, this should be
reflected in their experience points. When a player thinks up a
really good idea--solves a difficult puzzle, has his character talk
the group out of a tight situation, or just finds a novel way around
a problem--that's worth experience points. Players should be
encouraged to use their brains and get involved.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition to the constant
goals listed above, every game session will have some variable goals.
Most of these come from the adventure. Some may come from the
players' desires. Both types can be used to spur players on to more
effective role-playing.</font></p>

Goals</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Story goals are objectives
the DM sets up for an adventure. Rescue the prince, drive away a band
of marauding orcs, cleanse the haunted castle, find the assassin of
the late queen, recover the lost Gee-Whiz wand to save the
world--these are all story goals.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When the DM sets up a story,
he decides how many experience points he thinks the player characters
should get for accomplishing the big goal. This must be based on just
how difficult the whole adventure will be. If the characters
successfully accomplish this goal (which is by no means guaranteed),
they will earn this bonus experience.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes the DM might not
have a clear idea of what the goal of a particular adventure is. In
such a case the players can sometimes provide the goal, or at least a
clue. Listen to what they think they are supposed to do or what they
want to do. These can then become the goal of the adventure. Again,
assign experience points based on difficulty if they accomplish this.</font></p>

Point Awards</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are two categories of
experience point awards: group and individual. Group awards are
divided equally among all members of the adventuring party,
regardless of each individual's contribution. The idea here is that
simply being part of a group that accomplishes something teaches the
player character something useful.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	From a strictly game
mechanics point of view, this ensures that all player characters will
have the opportunity to advance in experience points at roughly the
same rate. Individual awards are optional, given to each player based
on the actions of his character.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Group
Awards</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All characters earn
experience for victory over their foes. There are two important
things to bear in mind here. First, this award applies only to foes
or enemies of the player characters--the monster or NPC must present
a real threat. Characters never receive experience for the defeat of
non-hostile creatures (rabbits, cattle, deer, friendly unicorns) or
NPCs (innkeepers, beggars, peasants). Second, no experience is earned
for situations in which the PCs have an overwhelming advantage over
their foes.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A 7th-level player character
who needs one more experience point to advance in level can't just
gather his friends together and hunt down a single orc. That orc
wouldn't stand a chance, so the player character was never at any
particular risk. If the same character had gone off on his own, thus
risking ambush at the hands of a band of orcs, the DM could rule that
the character had earned the experience.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM must decide what
constitutes a significant risk to the player characters. Often it is
sufficient if the characters think they are in danger, even when they
are not. Their own paranoia increases the risk (and enhances the
learning experience). Thus, if the party runs into a band of five
kobolds and becomes convinced that there are 50 more around the next
corner, the imagined risk becomes real for them. In such a case, an
experience point reward might be appropriate.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The characters must be
victorious over the creature, which is not necessarily synonymous
with killing it. Victory can take many forms. Slaying the enemy is
obviously victory; accepting surrender is victory; routing the enemy
is victory; pressuring the enemy to leave a particular neck of the
woods because things are getting too hot is a kind of victory.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A creature needn't die for
the characters to score a victory. If the player characters
ingeniously persuade the dragon to leave the village alone, this is
as much--if not more--a victory as chopping the beast into
dragonburgers!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Here's an example of
experience point awards: Delsenora and Rath, along with their
henchmen, have been hired to drive the orcs out of Wainwode Copse.
After some scouting, they spring several ambushes on orc raiding
parties. By the third shattering defeat, the orcs of Wainwode decide
they've had enough. Leaving their village, they cross the range of
hills that marks the boundary of the land and head off for easier
pickings elsewhere.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although Delsenora and Rath
have caused the orc village of 234 to leave, they only get the
experience for overcoming the 35 they bested in ambushes. Although
they did succeed in driving off the others, they did not face them
and were thus not exposed to personal risk. Even if they had raided
the orc village, the DM should only give them experience for those
orcs they directly faced. If, in the village, they routed the guards,
pursued them, and caused them to run again, they would only receive
experience for the guards once during the course of the battle. Once
beaten, the guards posed no significant threat to the party. However,
Rath and Delsenora have accomplished their mission of driving out the
orcs, making them eligible for the XP award for completing a story
goal.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To determine the number of XP
to give for overcoming enemies, use Table 31. Find the Hit Dice of
the creature on the table. Add the additional Hit Dice for special
powers from Table 32 and find the adjusted Hit Dice. Add this number
to the current Hit Dice value, so that a 1 + 1 Hit Die creature with
+2 Hit Dice of special abilities becomes a 3 + 1 Hit Dice creature
for calculation purposes.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This formula produces an
experience point value. Multiply this value by the number of
creatures of that type defeated and add together all total values.
The result is the total XP the group earns. It should be divided
among all of the group's surviving player characters.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, the player
characters manage to defeat three orcs, a rust monster, and a green
slime. Each orc is worth 15 XP, since they are one Hit Die each and
have no special abilities. The rust monster is worth 420 XP. It has
five Hit Dice but gains a bonus of +2 for a special magical attack
form (rusting equipment). The green slime is worth 175 XP, since its
base two Hit Dice are increased by 3 for a special non-magical attack
form and immunity to most spells and weapons. The player characters
divvy up a total of 640 XP.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Not all powers and abilities
are listed on Table 32. When dealing with a power not on the list,
either use the special entries or compare the new power to one
already defined.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The other group award is that
earned for the completion of an adventure. This award is determined
by the DM, based on the adventure's difficulty. There is no formula
to determine the size of this award, since too many variables can
come into play. However, the following guidelines may help.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The story award should not be
greater than the experience points that can be earned defeating the
monsters encountered during the adventure. Thus if the DM knows there
are roughly 1,200 experience points worth of monsters, the story
award should not exceed this amount.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The story award should give a
character no more than 1/10th the experience points he needs to
advance a level. This way the character will have to undertake
several adventures before he can advance to the next level.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Within these guidelines you
have a great deal of leeway. One of the most important uses of story
awards is to maintain what you feel is the proper rate of advancement
for player characters. By monitoring not just their levels, but also
their experience point totals, you can increase or decrease the rate
of character advancement through judicious use of story awards.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, you can award points
on the basis of survival. The amount awarded is entirely up to you.
However, such awards should be kept small and reserved for truly
momentous occasions. Survival is its own reward. Since story and
survival awards go hand in hand, you may be able to factor the
survival bonus into the amount you give for completing the adventure.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once you have calculated all
the experience points due your group of player characters (and you
should do this, not your players), divide the total by the number of
surviving and (at the DM's option) resurrected player characters.
This is the amount each surviving character gets.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although characters who died
during the course of an adventure normally earn no experience (one of
the penalties of dying), you can allow a character to earn some
experience for actions taken before he died, particularly if the
character died nobly, through no fault of his own, or at the very end
of the adventure. In such a case, it is simpler to give the character
a flat award than to try to determine separate experience totals for
those actions the character was involved in and those he was not.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As an option, the DM can
award XP for the cash value of</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">non-magical treasures. One XP
can be given per gold piece found. However, overuse of this option
can increase the tendency to give out too much treasure in the
campaign.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Individual experience point
awards are given for things a player does or things he has his
character do. Intelligent play is worth experience; good role-playing
is worth experience; actions that fit the group's style are worth
experience.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although some of these awards
are tied to abilities, giving out these experience points is purely a
discretionary act. It is up to the DM to decide if a player character
has earned the award and, within a given range, to determine the
amount of the award. These awards are normally given at the end of
each session, but this isn't a hard-and-fast rule--the DM can award
individual experience points any time he feels it appropriate.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Individual experience point
awards are divided into two categories. First are awards all player
characters can earn, regardless of class. After these are the awards
characters can earn according to their character group and class.

spell to trap a group of orcs who were attacking his party, since
this has little to do with the woodlands. If the priest were to use
the same spell to trap the same orcs just as they were attempting to
set fire to the forest, the character would gain the bonus.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When awarding individual
experience points, be sure the use warrants the award. Make it clear
to players that awards only will be given for the significant use of
an ability or spell. &quot;Significant use&quot; is defined by a
combination of several different factors. First, there must be an
obvious reason to use the ability. A thief who simply climbs every
wall he sees, hoping to gain the experience award, does not meet this
standard.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Second, there must be
significant danger. No character should get experience for using his
powers on a helpless victim. A fighter does not gain experience for
clubbing a shackled orc. A mage does not gain experience for casting
a house-cleaning cantrip. A thief does gain experience for opening
the lock on a merchant's counting house, since it might be trapped or
magical alarms might be triggered.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Third, experience points
should not be awarded when a player is being abusive to others in the
group or attempting to use his abilities at the expense of others.
Player characters should cooperate to succeed.</font></p>

<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">When to
Award Experience Points</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As a general guideline,
experience points should be given at the end of every gaming session,
while the DM still remembers what everyone did. If the awarding of
experience points is delayed for several sessions, until the end of a
given adventure, there is a chance the DM will overlook or forget
what the characters did in previous gaming sessions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Despite this risk, it isn't
always practical to award experience immediately. If the player
characters are still in the heart of the dungeon when the gaming
session ends, wait to award points until they return to the surface.
The DM can rule that characters receive experience only when they
have the opportunity to rest and tell others of their exploits. This
means that characters collect experience when </font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">they return to their homes,
stop at an inn, or the like. Since experience is, in part, increased
confidence and comprehension of their own abilities and events, the
retelling of the tale boosts the ego of the characters, and this
translates into experience.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes, even this rule is
not applicable, however. For example, the player characters might be
on a long journey through the desert and not see a settlement or
friendly soul for weeks on end. In such cases, experience can be
awarded after the characters have had time to reflect upon and
analyze their accomplishments. This may be as short as overnight (for
small experience awards) or as long as several days.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If, for whatever reason, the
DM decides not to award experience points at the end of a gaming
session, he should be sure to calculate and record the number of
experience points each character should receive for the session and
not rely on his memory.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

<p class="western" >

of Experience</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The prowess of player
characters is measured in levels. Levels are earned through the
accumulation of experience points. A separate table for each
character group (shown in Chapter 3 of the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Player's
Handbook</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">) tells how
many experience points characters of that group need to attain each
level.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a character earns enough
experience to attain the next level for his character class, he
immediately gains several benefits (unless the optional rules for
training are used). The character gains an additional die of hit
points, or a set number of hit points at higher levels. These are
added to both his current total and his maximum number of hit points.
The character may or may not improve in other abilities, including
combat and saving throws, dependent upon his character class.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Training
(Optional Rule)</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some DMs do not like the idea
that a character can instantly advance in level simply by acquiring
enough experience points. To their minds all improvement is
associated with schooling, practice, and study. Others argue that
characters are constantly doing these things to increase their
ability so formal schooling is not required. Either case may be true.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM might choose to
require characters to train before they increase in level. To train,
a character must have a tutor or instructor. This tutor must be of
the same class and higher level than the one the character is
training for. Thus, a 7th-level fighter training for 8th-level must
be taught by a 9th-level or higher fighter. The tutor must also know
the appropriate things. Fighters specialized in a given weapon must
find a tutor also specialized in that weapon. Mages seeking to study
a particular spell must find a tutor who knows that spell. A thief
seeking to improve his lockpicking must find a higher-level tutor
more accomplished in lockpicking.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Since not all characters are
suited to instructing others, any player character who attempts to
train another must make both a Wisdom check and a Charisma check. If
the Wisdom check is passed, the player character possesses the
patience and insight to nurture the student. If the Charisma check is
passed, the character also has the wit, firmness, and authority
needed to impress the lessons on the student. If either check is
failed, that character is close, but just not a teacher. If both
checks are failed, the character has absolutely no aptitude for
teaching. Alternatively, the DM can dispense with the die rolls and
rule for each player character, based on his knowledge of that
character's personality. It is assumed that all NPC tutors have
successfully passed these checks.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Second, the character must
pay the tutor. There is no set amount for this. The tutor will charge
what he thinks he can get away with, based on either greed or
reputation. The exact cost must be worked out between player
character and tutor, but an average of 100 gp per level pr week is
not uncommon.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, the player character
must spend time in training. The amount of time required depends on
the instructor's Wisdom. Subtract the Wisdom score from 19. This is
the minimum number of weeks the player character must spend in
training--it takes his instructor this long to go through all the
lessons and drills. At the end of this time, the player character
makes an Intelligence or Wisdom check, whichever is higher.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the check is successful,
the lessons have been learned and the character can advance in level.
If the check is failed, the character must spend another week in
training. At the end of this time, another check is made, with a +1
applied to the character's Intelligence or Wisdom score. The results
are the same as above, with each additional week spent in training
giving another +1 to the character's ability score. This +1 is for
the purpose of determining the success or failure of the check only.
It is not permanent or recorded.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One obvious result of the
training system is the development of different academies that
specialize in training different character classes. Because of their
importance in the adventuring community, these academies can become
quite powerful in the lives of the player characters. Imagine the
disastrous effect should one of the player characters be blacklisted
by his appropriate academy. Although the DM should not abuse such
power, the player characters should treat such institutions with care
and respect.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The AD&amp;D game is
intentionally very flexible concerning how slowly or quickly
characters earn experience--in general, this is left to the
discretion of the DM. Some players prefer a game of slow advancement,
allowing them time to develop and explore imaginary personalities.
Other players like a much faster pace and a definite feeling of
progress. Each DM and his players will likely settle into a pace that
best suits their group, without even realizing it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There is only one hard and
fast rule concerning advancement. Player characters should never
advance more than one level per time experience is awarded. If a
gaming session ends and a character has earned enough experience
points to advance two levels, the excess points are lost. The DM
should give the character enough experience to place him somewhere
between halfway and one point below the next highest level.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	An average pace in an AD&amp;D
game campaign is considered to be three to six adventures per level,
with more time per level as the characters reach higher levels.
However, it is possible to advance as quickly as one level per
adventure or as slowly as 10 or more adventures per level. The DM
should listen to his players.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the players are enjoying
themselves and aren't complaining about &quot;not getting anywhere,&quot;
then things are fine. If, on the other hand, they grouse about how
they never get any better or they're quickly reaching the highest
levels in the game, the pace of advancement probably needs to be
adjusted. This, like much that deals with awarding experience, may
not come to a DM immediately. Let experience be your guide.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The AD&amp;D game is an
adventure game designed to give players a feeling of excitement and
danger. Characters brave the unknown perils of moldering dungeons and
thorn-covered wilderness, facing hideous monsters and evil villains.
Thus, it is important for all players to know the basic rules for
handling combat.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To create the proper sense of
danger and excitement, the rules for combat must be thorough, but
they also must be playable and exciting enough to create a vivid
picture in the minds of the players. Combat in the AD&amp;D game has
to allow many different actions and outcomes--as many as the
imagination can produce. Knowing that anything could happen next,
because the rules allow it, creates excitement for everyone.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Since this isn't a combat
game, the rules are not ultra-detailed, defining the exact effect of
every blow, the subtle differences between obscure weapons, the
location of every piece of armor on the body, or the horrifying
results of an actual sword fight. Too many rules slow down play
(taking away from the real adventure) and restrict imagination. How
much fun is it when a character, ready to try an amazing and heroic
deed, is told, &quot;You can't do that because it's against the
rules.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Players should be allowed to
try whatever they want--especially if what they want will add to the
spirit of adventure and excitement. Just remember that there is a
difference between trying and succeeding.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To have the most fun playing
the AD&amp;D game, don't rely only on the rules. Like so much in a
good role-playing adventure, combat is a drama, a staged play. The DM
is both the playwright and the director, creating a theatrical
combat. If a character wants to try wrestling a storm giant to the
ground, let him. And a character who tries leaping from a second
floor window onto the back of a passing orc is adding to everyone's
fun.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The trick to making combat
vivid is to be less concerned with the rules than with what is
happening at each instant of play. If combat is only &quot;I hit. I
miss. I hit again,&quot; then something is missing. Combats should be
more like, &quot;One orc ducks under the table jabbing at your legs
with his sword. The other tries to make a flying tackle, but misses
and sprawls to the floor in the middle of the party!&quot; This takes

all--knowing when to use the rules and when to bend them.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As important as fighting is
to the AD&amp;D game, it isn't the be-all and end-all of play. It's
just one way for characters to deal with situations. If characters
could do nothing but fight, the game would quickly get boring. Every
encounter would be the same. Because there is more to the game than
fighting, we'll cover much more than simple hack-and-slash combat in
this chapter.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition to explaining the
basic mechanics of hitting and missing, there are rules for turning
undead, special ways to attack and defend, rules about poison, advice
for handling heroic feats, and more.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Many game terms are used
throughout the combat rules. To understand the rules, players must
understand these terms, so brief explanations appear below. Further
details are provided throughout this chapter.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Armor
Class (AC)</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">is the
protective rating of a type of armor. In some circumstances, AC is
modified by the amount of protection gained or lost because of the
character's situation. For instance, crouching behind a boulder
improves a character's Armor Class, while being attacked from behind
worsens his AC.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Abilities and situations can
also affect a character's Armor Class. High Dexterity gives a bonus
to Armor Class, for example. But even a character with a Dexterity
bonus can have this bonus negated if he is attacked from the rear.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Armor provides protection by
reducing the chance that a character is attacked successfully (and
suffers damage). Armor does not absorb damage, it prevents it. A
fighter in full plate mail may be a slow-moving target, but
penetrating his armor to cause any damage is no small task.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Armor Class is measured on a
scale from 10, the worst (no armor), to -10, the best (very powerful
magical armors). The lower the number, the more effective the armor.
Shields can also improve the AC of a character.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Damage
(D)</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">is what happens
to a character when an opponent attacks him successfully. Damage can
also occur as a result of poison, fire, falling, acid, and anything
even remotely dangerous in the real world. Damage from most attacks
is measured in hit points. Each time a character is hit, he suffers
points of damage. It could be as little as 1 point to as many as 80
or more. These points are subtracted from the character's current hit
point total. When this total reaches 0, the character is dead.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Initiative</b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
determines the order in which things happen in a combat round. Like
so many things in the world, initiative is determined by a
combination of ability, situation, and chance.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the start of each round of
a battle, an initiative roll is made by both sides. This roll can be
modified by the abilities of the combatants and by the situation. The
person or side with the lower modified die roll acts first.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Melee</b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
is any situation in which characters are battling each other
hand-to-hand, whether with fists, teeth, claws, swords, axes, pikes,
or something else. Strength and Dexterity are valuable assets in
melee.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Missile
combat</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">is defined as
any time a weapon is shot, thrown, hurled, kicked, or otherwise
propelled. Missile and melee combat have the same basic rules, but
there are special situations and modifiers that apply only to missile
combat.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Saving
throws</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">are measures of
a character's resistance to special types of attacks--poisons, magic,
and attacks that affect the whole body or mind of the character. The
ability to make successful saving throws improves as the character
increases in level.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>	</b></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Surprise</b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
can happen any time characters unexpectedly meet another group
(monsters, evil knights, peasants, etc.). Surprise is simply what
happens when one side--a person or party--is taken unawares, unable
to react until they gather their wits. Their opponents, if
unsurprised, are allowed a bonus round of action while the surprised
characters recover. It's entirely possible for both sides in a given
situation to be surprised!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Attacking with surprise gives
bonuses to the attack roll (see Table 35). A surprised character also
has a decreased chance of rolling a successful saving throw, if one
is needed.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Surprise is determined by a
die roll and is normally checked at the beginning of an encounter.
Surprise is very unpredictable, so there are very few modifiers to
the roll.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>THAC0</b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
is an acronym for &quot;To Hit Armor Class 0.&quot; This is the
number a character, NPC, or monster needs to attack an Armor Class 0
target successfully. THAC0 depends on a character's group and level
or a monster's Hit Dice (see Tables 37-39). The THAC0 number can be
used to calculate the number needed to hit any Armor Class. THAC0 is
refigured each time a character increases in level. Using THAC0
speeds the play of combat greatly.</font></p>

Attack Roll</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the heart of the combat
system is the attack roll. This is the die roll that determines
whether an attack succeeds or fails. The number a player needs to
make a successful attack roll is also called the &quot;to-hit&quot;
number. </font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Attack rolls are used for
attacks with swords, bows, rocks, and other weapons, as well as blows
from fists, tackling, and various hand-to-hand attacks. Attack rolls
are also used to resolve a variety of actions that require accuracy
(e.g., throwing a rock at a small target or tossing a sword to a
party member in the middle of a fight).</font></p>

the To-Hit Number</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The first step in making an
attack roll is to find the number needed to hit the target. Subtract
the Armor Class of the target from the attacker's THAC0. Remember
that if the Armor Class is a negative number, you </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>add</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
it to the attacker's THAC0. The character has to roll the resulting
number, or higher, on 1d20 to hit the target. Here's a simple
example: </font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>	Rath has reached 7th level
as a fighter. His THAC0 is 14 (found on Table 38), meaning he needs
to roll a 14 or better to hit a character or creature of Armor Class
0.</i></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>	In combat, Rath, attacking
an orc wearing chainmail armor (AC 6), needs to roll an 8 (14-6 = 8).
An 8 or higher on 1d20 will hit the orc. If Rath hits, he rolls the
appropriate dice (see Table 44 in the Player's Handbook) to determine
how much damage he inflicts.</i></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Modifiers
to the Attack Roll</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The example above is quite
simple. In a typical AD&amp;D game combat situation, THAC0 is
modified by weapon bonuses, Strength bonuses, and the like. Figure
Strength weapon modifiers, subtract the total from the base THAC0,
and record this modified THAC0 for each weapon on the character
sheet. Subtract the target's Armor Class from this modified THAC0
when determining the number needed to attack successfully.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Here's the same example, with
some common modifiers thrown in: </font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>	Rath is still a 7th-level
fighter. He has a Strength of 18/80 (which gives him a +2 bonus to
his attack roll). He fights with a long sword +1. His THACO is 14,
modified to 12 by his Strength and to 11 by his weapon. If attacking
the orc from the earlier example, Rath would have to roll a 5 or
higher on 1d20 in order to hit (11-6=5). Again, Table 44 in the
Player's Handbook</i></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>would tell him how much
damage he inflicts with his weapon (this information should also be
written on his character sheet).</i></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In combat, many factors can
modify the number a character needs for a successful hit. These
variables are reflected in modifiers to the to-hit number or to the
attack roll.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Strength

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A character's
Strength can modify the die roll, altering both the chance to hit and
the damage caused. This modifier is always applied to melees and
attacks with hurled missile weapons (a spear or an axe).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A positive Strength modifier
can be applied to bows if the character has a special bow made for
him, designed to take advantage of his high Strength. Characters with
Strength penalties always suffer them when using a bow. They simply
are not able to draw back the bowstring far enough. Characters never
have Strength modifiers when using crossbows--the power of the shot
is imparted by a machine.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Magical

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The magical
properties of a weapon can also modify combat. Items that impart a
bonus to the attack roll or Armor Class are identified by a plus
sign. For example, a</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
sword +1</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> improves a
character's chance to hit by one. A suit of</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
chain mail +1</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
improves the Armor Class of the character by one (which means you
subtract one from the character's AC, changing an AC of 5 to an AC of
4, for example). Cursed items have a negative modifier (a penalty),
resulting in a subtraction from the attack roll or an addition to
Armor Class.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There is no limit to the
number of modifiers that can be applied to a single die roll. Nor is
there a limit to the positive or negative number (the total of all
modifiers) that can be applied to a die roll.</font></p>

some of the more exotic pole arms, fall into more than one of these

To-Hit Numbers</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes the attacker's
to-hit number seems impossible to roll. An attack might be so
difficult it requires a roll greater than 20 (on a 20-sided die), or
so ridiculously easy it can be made on a roll less than 1. In both
cases, an attack roll is still required.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The reason is simple: With
positive die roll modifiers (for magic, Strength, situation, or
whatever), a number greater than 20 can be rolled. Likewise, die roll
penalties can push the attack roll below 0.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	No matter what number a
character needs to hit, a roll of 20 is always considered a hit and a
roll of 1 is always a miss--unless the DM rules otherwise. Under most
circumstances, a natural 20 hits and a natural 1 misses, regardless
of any modifiers applied to the die roll.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thus, even if a character's
chance to hit a monster is 23 and the character has a -3 penalty
applied to the die roll, he might</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">be able to score a hit--but
only if the die roll is a 20 before any modifiers are applied.
Likewise, a character able to hit a monster on a 3 or better, waving
a</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i> sword +4</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">,
could still miss if a 1 is rolled on the die.</font></p>

THAC0</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To make an attack roll, the
character's THAC0 must be known. This depends on the group and level,
if the attacker is a player character or NPC, or the Hit Dice if the
attacker is a monster or an animal. All 1st-level characters have
THAC0s of 20.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For a character of level 1
through level 20, consult Table 38. This table lists the THAC0 number
of each group through 20th level, so players don't have to perform
any calculations.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For a character higher than
20th level, find the Improvement Rate for the character's group in
Table 37. There you'll find the number of levels a character must
advance to reduce his THAC0 by 1 or more points. Calculate the
character's THAC0 according to his level. A priest, for example,
improves by two for every three levels he advances. A 5th level
cleric would have a THAC0 of 18. A rogue (a thief or bard) improves
one point every two levels. A 17th-level rogue would have a THAC0 of
12. Table 38 lists the THAC0 number of each group at each level.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Creatures do not have
character classes and levels, so they calculate THAC0s differently,
basing it on the Hit Dice of the creature. Table 39 lists the THAC0
number for monsters having various numbers of Hit Dice. When a
creature has three or more points added to its Hit Dice, count
another die when consulting the table.</font></p>

and Encounters</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Encounters are the heart of
the AD&amp;D game. And since encounters with monsters and NPCs often
lead to combat, an understanding of what happens during battles is
vital. There are several factors the DM will consider in any combat,
most of which arise from the circumstances of the encounter. Is
anyone surprised? How far apart are the opponents? How many of them
are there? Answers to these questions are found in Chapter 11:
Encounters. These are questions common to all encounters, whether
combat occurs.</font></p>

<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">The
Combat Round</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If an encounter escalates
into a combat situation, the time scale of the game automatically
goes to rounds (also called melee rounds, or combat rounds). Rounds
are used to measure the actions of characters in combat or other
intensive actions in which time is important.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A round is approximately one
minute. Ten combat rounds equal a turn (or, put another way, a turn
equals 10 minutes of game time). This is particularly important to
remember for spells that last for turns, rather than rounds.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But these are just
approximations--precise time measurements are impossible to make in
combat. An action that might be ridiculously easy under normal
circumstances could become an undertaking of truly heroic scale when
attempted in the middle of a furious, chaotic battle.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Imagine the simple act of
imbibing a</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i> healing
potion</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">. First a
character decides to drink the potion before retiring for the night.
All he has to do is get it out of his backpack, uncork it, and drink
the contents. No problem.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now imagine the same thing in
the middle of a fight. The potion is safely stowed in the character's
backpack. First he takes stock of the situation to see if anyone else
can get the potion out for him. However, not surprisingly, everyone
is rather busy. So, sword in one hand, he shrugs one strap of the
pack off his shoulder. Then, just as two orcs leap toward him, the
other strap threatens to slip down, entangling his sword arm. Already
the loose strap keeps him from fully using his shield.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Holding the shield as best as
possible in front of him, he scrambles backward to avoid the
monsters' wild swings. He gets pushed back a few more feet when a
companion shoulders past to block and give him a little time. So he
kneels, lays down his sword, and slips the backpack all the way off.
Hearing a wild cry, he instinctively swings up his shield just in
time to ward off a glancing blow.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Rummaging through the pack,
he finally finds the potion, pulls it out, and, huddling behind his
shield, works the cork free. Just then there is a flash of flame all
around him--a fireball! He grits his teeth against the heat, shock,
and pain and tries not to crush or spill the potion vial. Biting back
the pain of the flames, he is relieved to see the potion is intact.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He quickly gulps it down,
reclaims his sword, kicks his backpack out of the way, and runs back
up to the front line. In game terms, the character withdrew, was
missed by one attacker, made a successful saving throw vs. spell
(from the</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i> fireball</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell), drank a potion, and was ready for combat the next round.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">What You
Can Do in One Round</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Whatever the precise length
of a combat round, a character can accomplish only one basic action
in that round, be it making an attack, casting a spell, drinking a
potion, or tending to a fallen comrade. The basic action, however,
may involve several lesser actions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When making an attack, a
character is likely to close with his opponent, circle for an
opening, feint here, jab there, block a thrust, leap back, and
perhaps finally make a telling blow. A spellcaster might fumble for
his components, dodge an attacker, mentally review the steps of the
spell, intone the spell, and then move to safety when it is all done.
It already has been shown what drinking a potion might entail. All of
these things could happen in a bit less than a minute or more, but
the standard is one minute and one action to the round.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some examples of the actions
a character can accomplish include the following:</font></p>
<p class="western" >

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In real life, combat is one
of the closest things to pure anarchy. Each side is attempting to
harm the other, essentially causing disorder and chaos. Thus, combats
are filled with unknowns--unplanned events, failed attacks, lack of
communication, and general confusion and uncertainty. However, to
play a battle in the game, it is necessary to impose some order on
the actions. Within a combat round, there is a set series of steps
that must be followed. These are:</font></p>
<p class="western" >

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In the first
step, the DM secretly decides in general terms what each opponent
will do, such as attack, flee, or cast a spell. He does not announce
his decisions to the players. If a spell is to be cast, the DM picks
the spell before the players announce their characters' actions.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Next, the
players give a general indication of what their characters are
planning to do. This does not have to be perfectly precise and can be
changed somewhat if the DM decides that circumstances warrant.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the characters are
battling goblins, a player can say, &quot;My fighter will attack&quot;
without announcing which goblin he will strike. If the characters are
battling a mixed group of goblins and ogres, the player has to state
whether his character is attacking goblins or ogres.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Spells to be cast must also
be announced at this time and cannot be changed once the initiative
die is rolled. In any situation where the abilities of a character
could make a difference, a clear description must be given.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before moving on, the DM will
make sure he has a clear idea of not only what the player characters
are doing, but also what actions any hirelings and henchmen are
taking. Once he has a clear view of everything that's likely to
happen, the DM can overrule any announced action that violates the
rules (or in the case of an NPC, is out of character).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He is not required to
overrule an impossible action, but he can let a character attempt it
anyway, knowing full well the character cannot succeed. It is not the
DM's position to advise players on the best strategies, most
intelligent actions, or optimum maneuvers for their characters.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The above sequence is not
immutable. Indeed, some monsters violate the standard sequence, and
some situations demand the application of common sense. In these

determines who acts first in any given combat round. Initiative is
not set, but changes from round to round--combat being an uncertain

act before another.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Initiative is normally
determined with a single roll for each side in a conflict. This tells

in ascending order of initiative.</font></p>

in the combat completes one action before the second (or subsequent)

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Take, for example, a fighter
who can attack twice per round, and say he's battling creatures that

creature gets its attack. Finally, the fighter gets his second
attack.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Casting times for spells can
modify initiative rolls, creating a realistic delay for the
spellcaster. When a spell's &quot;casting time&quot; parameter is
given as a number without any units (e.g., rounds or turns), then
that number is added to the caster's initiative roll to determine his
modified initiative. When a spell requires a round or more to cast, a
normal initiative roll is not made--a spell requiring one round to
cast takes effect at the end of the current round, after all other
actions are completed.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Spells that require more than
one round to cast involve some bookkeeping. The DM or one of the
players must keep track of the rounds spent in casting. If the
spellcasting character is disturbed during this time, the spell is
lost. If all goes well, the spell takes effect at the very end of the
last round of the required casting time. Thus, a spell requiring 10
minutes to cast would require 10 combat rounds, and wouldn't take
effect until the very end of the 10th round.</font></p>

idea of what weapon speed factors are about.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Weapon speed factors slow the
speed of a character's attack. The higher the weapon speed factor,
the heavier, clumsier, or more limited the weapon is. For the most
part, weapon speed factors apply to all creatures using manufactured
weapons. The speed factor of a weapon is added to the initiative roll
of the character to get his modified initiative roll.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thus, if the DM decides to
use weapon speed factors for player characters, they also should be
used for giants, orcs, centaurs, and the like. Otherwise the DM isn't
being fair to the players. However, creatures with natural weapons
are not affected by weapon speed. Their attacks are natural
extensions of their bodies, giving them much faster recovery and

virtually no space side-to-side. It does, however, need that 12 to 20
feet in front! A sabre and a battle-axe are about the same size, but
the battle axe requires more space--the sabre can be thrust straight

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Pole arms and similar

feet--makes their use in individual combat silly, if not futile.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	An opponent can easily slip
inside the reach of the pole arm, at which point the poor pikeman can
only try to back up or drop his weapon. Little else is likely to be
effective. However, if the same man with a pike is lined up with 30
of his fellows in a nice tight formation, he suddenly becomes very
dangerous. Where one pikeman presented only a lone spear point, 30
pikemen present a deadly thicket.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The pole arm's big advantage
is the small frontage each man needs to be effective. A man using a
piercing pole arm can use his weapon effectively with just three feet
of space, side-to-side. This allows a tightly packed line of pikemen.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In a group, men armed with
pole arms should be set for defense or advancing slowly (1/4 normal
movement rate). They automatically make their attack rolls prior to
any opponent attempting to close with them. However, after the first
round of combat any surviving opponents are inside the reach of the
pole arms and the pikemen must drop their pikes and draw weapons more

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Because the AD&amp;D game
uses a generalized system for damage, called shots cannot be used to

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A called shot can cause a
target to drop items or react in some other, more subtle, way. It can
penetrate weak points in armor. It also can be used in attempts to
knock an object out of a hand, shatter a flask, or otherwise damage
items. Called shots can be very useful in activating the trigger of a
known trap (if this can be done with a weapon) or in impressing the

Cross-index the character's modified attack roll with the proper

<p class="western" >

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes the most effective
attack is simply to pull an opponent down by sheer numbers. No
attempt is made to gain a particular hold or even to harm the victim.
The only concern is to pin and restrain him.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To overbear an opponent, a
normal attack roll is made. For every level of size difference (1 if
a Large attacker takes on a Medium defender, for example), the attack
roll is modified by 4 (+4 if the attacker is larger; -4 if the
defender is larger).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The defending creature also
gains a benefit if it has more than two legs: a -2 penalty to the
attacker's roll for every leg beyond two. There is no penalty to the
defender if it has no legs. A lone orc attempting to pull down a
horse and rider would have at least a -8 penalty applied to the
attack roll (-4 for size and -4 for the horse's four legs).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the attack succeeds, the
opponent is pulled down. A character can be pinned if further
successful overbearing attacks are rolled each round. For pinning
purposes, do not use the prone modifier to combat (from Table 35).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If multiple attackers are all
attempting to pull down a single target, make only one attack roll
with a +1 bonus for each attacker beyond the first. Always use the
to-hit number of the weakest attacker to figure the chance of
success, since cooperation always depends on the weakest link.
Modifiers for size should be figured for the largest attacker of the
group.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A giant and three pixies
attempting to pull down a man would use the pixies' attack roll,

difference of the giant (Huge) and the man (Medium).</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As you might expect, weapons
have their place in non-lethal combat, whether a character is

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A character
attempting to punch, wrestle, or overbear an armed opponent can do so
only by placing himself at great risk. Making matters worse, an armed
defender is automatically allowed to strike with his weapon before
the unarmed attack is made, regardless of the initiative roll. Since
his opponent must get very close, the defender gains a +4 bonus to
his attack and damage rolls. If the attacker survives, he can then
attempt his attack.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Those involved in a wrestling
bout are limited to weapons of small size after the first round of
combat. It's very difficult to use a sword against someone who is
twisting your sword arm or clinging to your back, trying to break
your neck. For this reason, nearly all characters will want to carry
a dagger or a knife.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It is possible
to make an armed attack without causing serious damage--striking with
the flat of the blade, for example. This is not as easy as it sounds,
however.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	First, the character must be
using a weapon that enables him to control the damage he inflicts.
This is impossible with an arrow or sling. It isn't even feasible
with a war hammer or mace. It can be done with swords and axes, as
long as the blade can be turned so it doesn't cut.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Second, the character has a
-4 penalty to his attack roll, since handling a weapon in this way is
clumsier than usual. The damage from such an attack is 50% normal;
one-half of this damage is temporary, lasting one turn after the
fight is over and causing unconsciousness (never death) if the
character drops below zero hit points.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When dealing with
non-humanoid opponents, a number of factors must be considered.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	First, unintelligent
creatures, as a rule, never try to grapple, punch, or pull down an
opponent. They cheerfully settle for tearing him apart, limb by limb.
This, to their small and animalistic minds, is a better solution.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Second, the natural weapons
of a creature are always usable. Unlike men with swords, a lion or a
carnivorous ape doesn't lose the use of its teeth and fangs just
because a character is very close to it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, and of greatest
importance, creatures tend to be better natural fighters than humans.
All attacks for a tiger are the same as punching or wrestling. It's
just that the tiger has claws. Furthermore, a tiger can use all of
its legs effectively.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Many spells used by priests
and wizards take effect only when the target is touched by the
caster. Under normal circumstances, this is no problem. The
spellcaster reaches out and touches the recipient. However, if the
target is unwilling, or the spell is used in the midst of a general
melee, the situation is much different.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The spellcaster
must make a successful attack roll for the spell to have any effect.
The wizard or priest calculates his THAC0 number normally, according
to the intended victim's Armor Class and other protections. The DM
can modify the roll if the victim is unprepared for or unaware of the
attack. If the roll succeeds, the spellcaster touches the target and
the normal spell effect occurs.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">When attempting
to cast a spell on a willing target, the casting is automatic as long
as both characters are not engaged in combat. For example, if a
fighter withdraws from melee, a cleric could heal him during the next
round.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the recipient of the spell
attempts to do anything besides waiting for the spell to take effect,
an attack roll against AC 10 must be made. However, no AC modifiers
for Dexterity are applied, since the target is not trying to avoid
the spell.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Whenever a touch spell is
successful, the spellcaster suffers from any special defenses of his
target, if they are continually in operation. A successful touch to a
vampire would not result in energy drain, since the power only works
when the vampire wills it. But touching a fire elemental would result
in serious burns.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a touch spell is cast,
it normally remains effective only for that round. However, certain
spells list special conditions or durations. Be sure to check each
spell description carefully.</font></p>

Hits (Optional Rule)</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some players feel combat
should involve more than just the chance to hit and the amount of
damage done. Some propose elaborate tables--critical hit
tables--detailing all manner of horrible results and misfortunes.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The simplest critical hit
system makes every natural 20 rolled on the attack roll count for
double damage. Roll the appropriate damage dice twice for the attack
(do not double the result of a single damage roll) and only count
damage modifiers for Strength, magic, etc., once.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A second method is to allow
characters or monsters to make an extra attack each time they roll a
natural 20. The additional attack is made immediately, at the same
target, and is figured just like a normal attack. As long as a
natural 20 is rolled, the character or monster continues to make
additional attacks. A very lucky character could roll a 20 on his
first attack and then roll a 20 on his additional attack, allowing
him to roll a third attack. If this attack also resulted in a 20, a
fourth attack could be made, etc. This system gives characters the
chance of causing extra damage without guaranteeing success.</font></p>

Fumbles</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Critical fumbles are less
easily defined than critical hits. One system that works rules that a
die roll of 1 results in some unfortunate event happening to the
character who rolled it. The DM must decide what the exact event is
based on the situation, although it should not be one that causes
damage.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A character could trip and
sprawl to the floor, break his sword hitting a stone pillar, get his
axe wedged in a wooden beam, or have one of his backpack straps slip
off his shoulder, getting in the way. (Of course, magical weapons are
not likely to break under normal use.)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The normal result of a
critical fumble is the loss of the next round's attack as the
character gets up off the floor, digs out a new weapon, pulls his axe
out of the beam, or struggles to get his pack where it belongs.
Critical failures add a dose of excitement and humor to combat.</font></p>

whatever happens, happens to both player characters and NPCs.</font></p>

(Optional Rule)</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	During a one-minute combat
round, each character is assumed to block many attempted attacks and
see many of his own attacks blocked. In normal combat, characters
parry all the time--there's no need to single out each parry.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a character deliberately
chooses not to parry, his chance of being hit increases. A mage
casting a spell, for instance, gains no AC adjustment for Dexterity.
Thus, choosing to parry, in and of itself, is not a separate option
under the AD&amp;D game rules.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the same time, the
assumption is that characters in combat are constantly exposing
themselves to some risk--trying to get a clear view of a target or
looking for the opening to make an attack. There are times, however,
when this is not the case. Sometimes, the only thing a character
wants to do is avoid being hit.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To make himself harder to
hit, a character can parry--forfeit all actions for the round. He
can't attack, move, or cast spells. This frees the character to
concentrate solely on defense. At this point, all characters but
warriors gain an AC bonus equal to half their level. A 6th-level
wizard would have a +3 bonus to his AC (lowering his AC by 3). A
warrior gets a bonus equal to half his level plus one. A 6th-level
fighter would gain a +4 AC bonus.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This benefit is not a perfect
all-around defense, and it's not effective against rear or missile
attacks. It applies only to those foes attacking the defender from
the front. This optional defense has no effect against magical
attacks, so it wouldn't do anything to protect a character from the
force of</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i> lightning

into two general categories. The first includes all standard,
direct-fire, single-target missiles, such as slings, arrows,
quarrels, spears, throwing axes, and the like. The second includes
all grenade-like missiles that have an area effect. Thus an attack
with these weapons does not have to hit the target directly. Included
in this group are small flasks of oil, acid, poison, holy water,
potions, and boulders. Hurled boulders are included because they
bounce and bound along after they hit, leaving a swath of
destruction.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The first step in making a
missile attack is to find the range from the attacker to the target.
This is measured in yards from one point to the other and is compared
to the range categories for the weapon used (see Table 45 in the</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
Player's Handbook</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the distance is greater
than the long range given, the target is out of range. If the
distance is between the long- and medium-range numbers, the target is
at long range. When it is between the medium- and short-range
numbers, medium range is used. And when it is equal to or less than
the short-range distance, the target is at short range.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Short-range attacks suffer no
range modifier. Medium-range attacks suffer a -2 penalty to the
attack roll. Long-range attacks suffer a -5 penalty. Some weapons
have no short range since they must arc a certain distance before
reaching their target. These attacks are always made with an attack
roll penalty.</font></p>

Into a Melee</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Missile weapons are intended
mainly as distance weapons. Ideally, they are used before the
opponents reach your line. However, ideal situations are all too
rare, and characters often discover that the only effective way to
attack is to shoot arrows (or whatever) at an enemy already in melee
combat with their companions. While possible, and certainly allowed,
this is a risky proposition.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When missiles are fired into
a melee, the DM counts the number of figures in the immediate area of
the intended target. Each medium figure counts as 1. Tiny figures
count as 1/3, Small figures as 1/2, Large as 2, Huge as 4, and
Gargantuan as 6. The total value is compared to the value of each
character or creature in the target melee. Using this ratio, the DM
rolls a die to determine who (or what) will be the target of the
shot. After the DM determines who or what is the target, a normal
attack is rolled. The DM doesn't tell the player who will be hit if
the attack succeeds.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, Tarus Bloodheart
(man-sized, or 1 point) and Rath (also man-sized, or 1 point) are
fighting a giant (size G, 6 points) while Thule fires a long bow at
the giant. The total value of all possible targets is 8 (6 + 1 + 1).
There's a 1-in-8 chance that Rath is the target; a 1-in-8 chance that
Tarus is hit; and a 6-in-8 chance the shot hits the giant. The DM
could roll 1d8 to determine who gets hit, or he could reduce the
ratios to a percentage (75% chance the giant is hit, etc.) and roll
percentile dice.</font></p>

Cover Against Missile Fire</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One of the best ways to avoid
being hit and injured is to hide behind something--a wall, a tree, a
building corner, a heap of boulders, or whatever happens to be
available. Professional adventurers, wishing to make this sound
heroic, call this &quot;taking cover.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Taking cover doesn't work
particularly well in a melee, since the cover hampers defenders and
attackers equally. However, it is quite an effective tactic against
missile fire.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are two types of
protection a character can have. The first is &quot;concealment,&quot;
also called soft cover. A character hiding behind a clump of bushes
is concealed. He can be seen, but only with difficulty, and it's no
easy task to determine exactly where he is. The bushes cannot stop an
arrow, but they do make it less likely that the character is hit.
Other types of concealment include curtains, tapestries, smoke, fog,
and brambles.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The other type of protection
is &quot;cover,&quot; sometimes called, more precisely, hard cover.
It is, as its name implies, something a character can hide behind
that will block a missile. Hard cover includes stone walls, the
corner of a building, tables, doors, earth embankments, tree trunks,
and magical</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i> walls of
force</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Cover helps a potential
target by giving the attacker a negative modifier to his attack roll.
The exact modifier for concealment or cover depends on the degree to
which it is being used as shelter. A character who stands behind a
two-foot wall is a pretty obvious target, especially when compared to
the character who lies down behind that wall and carefully peers over
it. Table 44 lists the different modifiers for varying degrees of
cover and concealment.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Cover also has an affect on
saving throws, granting the character the modifier listed on Table 44
as a bonus to his saving throws against spells that cause physical
damage (e.g.,</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition, a character who
has 90% cover (or more) suffers one-half normal damage on a failed
saving throw, and no damage at all if a saving throw is successful.
This assumes, of course, that the cover is between the spell effect
and the target--a man crouching behind a stone wall would be
protected if a fireball exploded in front of the wall, but would not
be protected by cover if the blast occurred behind him, on his side
of the wall.</font></p>

Missiles</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Unlike standard missiles,
which target a specific creature, a grenade-like missile is aimed at
a point, whether this point is a creature or a spot on the ground.
When the attack is announced, the player indicates where he wants the
missile to land. This then becomes the target point and is used to
determine the direction and distance of any scatter.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Most grenade-like missiles
are items of opportunity or necessity, such as flasks of oil, vials
of holy water, or beakers of acid. As such, these items are not
listed on the equipment tables for range, ROF, and damage. The range
each can be thrown varies with the Strength of the character and the
weight of the object.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A missile of five pounds or
less can be thrown about 30 feet. Short range is 10 feet, medium
range is 20 feet, and everything beyond is maximum range. Heavier
items have reduced ranges. Just how far an object can be thrown is
decided by the DM.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Exceptionally heavy items can
be thrown only if the character rolls a successful bend bars/lift
gates check. In no case can a character throw an item heavier than
his Strength would allow him to lift. Thus, the DM can rule that a
character would have little trouble chucking a half-empty backpack
across a 10-foot chasm, but the character would need to make a check
to heave an orc 10 feet through the air into the faces of his
fiendish friends.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once a container hits, it
normally breaks immediately. However, this is not always true. Some
missiles, like soft leather flasks or hard pottery, are particularly
resistant. If there's some doubt about whether a thrown object will
break, the DM can require an item saving throw to see if it shatters
or rips, spewing its contents everywhere.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a missile is off-target,
it is important to know where it landed--an errant grenade-like
missile could present a hazard to other characters, start a fire, or
eat a hole in the floor. The process of finding where it lands is
known as &quot;scatter.&quot; First roll 1d10 and consult the Scatter
Diagram.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hurled boulders are handled
using the grenade-like missiles rules, even though they do not burst.
Boulders tend to bounce beyond their initial point of impact and can
hit several characters in a single attack. They are particularly
devastating against tightly packed groups.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When attacking with a
boulder, determine the target, to-hit number, and scatter (in the
case of a miss) according to the rules for grenade-like missiles. The
distance the boulder scatters should be doubled, however.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the boulder scatters to
the left or right, it moves roughly 45 to 60 degrees off the original
line of attack. A boulder moves along this line for 3d10 feet. If the
targets are in a relatively open area (a group marching through a
snow field, for example), there is only a slim chance that anyone
will be hit by the bounding missile.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the boulder moves through
a space occupied by a character (or monster), roll again for a hit
(recalculating THAC0 as necessary), applying a -2 penalty for each 10
feet, or fraction thereof, the boulder has bounced since it hit.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the player characters are
in an area where movement is restricted--a formation of pikemen, for
example, or a large party in a 10' wide corridor--no additional
boulder attack is made. The boulder strikes all targets in its path.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There may be times when
charmed creatures, perhaps even party members, will be compelled to
fight their companions. When this happens, remember that the

decisions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a charmed player character
is compelled to attack his friends, he must do so in an effective
manner. Grappling or punching is not acceptable if the character
possesses a better method. At the same time, the charmed character
need use only those abilities that are obvious to his new (and, one
hopes, temporary) master.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thus, if a charmed fighter
with a sword at his side is carrying a</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>

he fights with his sword unless specifically commanded to do
otherwise. The master in this case could not command him to use the</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>

unless he had some way of knowing the fighter carried one.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Similarly, a wizard's master
must know which spells his charmed spellcaster possesses, and which
he has memorized. This is most commonly learned simply by asking.
However, due to the charmed fellow's befuddled state, there is a 25
percent chance that he will unwittingly cast a spell harmful to
himself and his master. Relying on charmed spellcasters can be a very

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A charmed creature has two
critical limitations on its actions. First, it cannot carry out
commands requiring individual initiative. The master cannot say,
&quot;Fight with your most powerful magical item!&quot; since this
requires judgment on the part of the charmed character. Second, the
charmed creature won't obey any command that would obviously lead to
self-destruction. Since combat is composed of many different
variables, fighting in itself is not clearly self-destructive, even
against hopeless-seeming odds.</font></p>

charm power in the AD&amp;D game, that of monsters and that of
characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The charm power of monsters,
such as vampires, makes verbal communication unnecessary. The charmed
creature understands the monster's desires through mental command. A
character charmed by this power obeys the commands of his master
totally, at least within the limits of his ability and the guidelines
above.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The charm power of characters
is more limited. The master must have some method of making himself
understood to the charmed creature, preferably by speaking the same
language. Otherwise, charmed creatures can attempt to follow their
master's hand gestures. This can be a useful and entertaining spur to
role-playing.</font></p>

Attacks</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Monsters with a gaze attack,
such as the basilisk, have the power to affect an opponent simply by
making eye contact. This makes these creatures incredibly dangerous,
for the slightest glance can cause great harm.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Characters who look directly
at such creatures to attack them, or those who are surprised by the
creature, automatically meet the creature's gaze. These unfortunate
characters must make the appropriate saving throw or suffer the
effects of the creature's attack. Such attackers undergo the gaze
attack each round they attack. In large groups, only the front rank
can meet the gaze, a fate that can be avoided if the attacker
approaches from the rear, where the creature cannot see.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Characters can also attempt
to avoid the gaze by looking in the general direction of the creature
without actually looking into its eyes. This enables characters to
see the target well enough to fight normally without falling victim
to its power. However, there is a 20% chance each round that an
attacker trying this trick will accidentally meet the gaze of the
creature.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, a character can
completely avert his gaze or close his eyes when attacking the
creature, preventing any chance of meeting the creature's gaze. This
is like fighting in the dark, and the character suffers all the
normal penalties for fighting while blinded.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Safer than all of these
methods is to use some type of reflective surface--a mirror or highly
polished shield is very handy. The powers of gaze attacks are not

medusa in a mirror.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For this trick to be
effective, there must be some source of light available, since
nothing can be reflected in darkness. Also, characters should be
reminded that using a mirror can be disorienting. The character must
back toward his target, holding the mirror in his shield arm. He
suffers a -2 penalty to his chance to hit and does not gain the
benefits of his shield or his Armor Class bonus for Dexterity when
the creature attacks him.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Creatures with gaze attacks
can choose not to use their power. In this case, it is the creature
that avoids looking at the characters. Not meeting their gaze, it
can't affect them. Creatures intelligent enough to parley may do this
on occasion.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Especially powerful creatures
possess innate abilities, magical powers they can use at will. The
majority of these function like spells. Thus, a brownie who is able
to cause confusion has the same effect as a character who casts the</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
confusion</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell.
Creatures able to become invisible at will usually use all the normal
rules for the</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
invisibility</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Innate abilities are
different from spells in one major way, however. Unlike spells,
innate abilities are natural powers and do not require casting times
or any components (although there is an initiative modifier),
including gestures or words--unless these things are used for
dramatic effect. (The monster casually points to the place where his
spell will occur and then looks at the party with a wicked smile.)
Innate abilities are activated by the merest mental command of the
creature.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In all other respects, innate
abilities function like spells. They have the same range, area of
effect, and duration limitations of the spell of the same name. When
the spell in question varies in power according to the level of the
caster, the creature is assumed to have a level equal to its Hit
Dice. If this means the creature is of insufficient level to cast the
spell, it uses the spell at the minimum level needed to cast it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Innate abilities generally
can be used just once a round. Further, a creature cannot use an
innate ability and make an attack in the same round.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Various creatures in the AD&amp;D
game possess breath weapons, the most memorable being the roaring
gout of flame spewed out by a red dragon. These weapons normally
affect a cone-shaped area. One point is the dragon's mouth, and the
breath widens as it extends outward. No attack roll is required for a
breath weapon. All characters and creatures within the area of effect
must make the appropriate saving throw and suffer the consequences of
a successful breath attack.</font></p>

Saving Throw</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The saving throw is a die
roll that gives a chance, however slim, that the character or
creature finds some way to save himself from certain destruction, or
at least lessen the damage of a successful attack.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	More often than not, the
saving throw represents an instinctive act on the part of the
character--diving to the ground just as a fireball scorches the
group; blanking the mind just as a mental battle begins; blocking the
worst of an acid spray with a shield. The exact action is not
important. DMs and players can think of lively and colorful
explanations of why a saving throw succeeded or failed. Explanations
tailored to the events of the moment enhance the excitement of the
game.</font></p>

<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Rolling
Saving Throws</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To make a saving throw, a
player rolls 1d20. The result must be equal to or greater than the
character's saving throw number. The number a character needs to roll
varies depending upon his group, his level, and what he is trying to
save himself from. A character's saving throw numbers can be found in
Table 46. Multi-class characters use the most advantageous saving
roll.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Saving throws are made in a
variety of situations: For attacks involving paralyzation, poison, or
death magic; rod, staff, or wand; petrification or polymorph; breath
weapon; and spells. The type of saving throw a character must roll is
determined by the specific spell, monster, magical item, or situation
involved.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Monsters also use Table 46.
However, they do not find their saving throw numbers by group and
level, since they have neither. All creatures save against poison and
death magic at a level equal to the number of their Hit Dice.
Intelligent monsters save versus all other attacks at this level as
well.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Creatures with no
intelligence (even less than animal intelligence) save at a level
equal to half the number of their Hit Dice. Any additions to their
Hit Dice are counted as well, at the rate of one die for every four
points or fraction thereof. Thus, an intelligent creature with 5 + 6
Hit Dice would save at 7th level (5 Hit Dice + another die for the 2
remaining). A non-intelligent beast of the same Hit Dice would save
against all but poison and death at 4th level (round up).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Most monsters use the Warrior
group table to determine their save. However, those that have
abilities of other classes use the most favorable saving throw. A
creature able to fight and use a large number of spells could use
either the Warrior or Wizard groups, whichever was better for a
particular saving throw. Creatures that lack fighting ability use the
group that most closely resembles their own abilities. A
fungus-creature that can only cast spells would use the Wizard group
table to determine saving throws.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes the type of saving
throw required by a situation or item isn't clear, or more than one
category of saving throw may seem appropriate. For this reason, the
saving throw categories in Table 46 are listed in order of
importance, beginning with paralyzation, poison, and death magic, and

whenever a character is affected by a paralyzing attack (regardless
of source), poison (of any strength), or certain spells and magical

which exceptional force of will or physical fortitude is needed.</font></p>

the target voluntarily chooses not to resist the effect of a spell or

full effect.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The intention not to resist
must be clearly stated or set up through trickery, however. If a
character is attacked by surprise or caught unawares, he is normally
allowed a saving throw. The DM can modify this saving throw, making
the chance of success worse if the situation warrants it. Only in
extreme cases of trickery and deception should an unwitting character
be denied a saving throw.</font></p>

avoid danger through the use of one of his abilities, an ability
check can be used in lieu of a saving throw.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, Ragnar the thief
has broken into someone's home when he hears a grating noise from the
ceiling above him. He looks up to find a five-ton block of the
ceiling headed straight for him! He is going to need speedy reactions

by magical items, specific rules, and special situations. These
modifiers can increase or decrease the chance of a successful saving
throw.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Modifiers that increase the
chance are given as a number preceded by a plus sign. Modifiers that
make success more difficult are given as a number preceded by a minus
sign (-1, -2, etc.)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Saving throw modifiers affect
a character's die roll, not the saving throw number needed. Thus, if
Delsenora needed an 11 for a successful saving throw vs.
petrification and had a +1 bonus to her save, she would still need to
roll an 11 or higher after all adjustments were made. But the +1
bonus would be added to her die roll, so that effectively she needs
to roll only a 10 on the die to reach her saving throw number of 11.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Magic resistance is an innate
ability. That is, the possessor does not have to do anything special
to use it. The creature need not even be aware of the threat for its
magic resistance to operate. Such resistance is part of the creature
or item and cannot be separated from it. Creatures, however, can
lower their magic resistance at will.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Magic resistance is also an
individual ability. A creature with magic resistance cannot impart
this power to others by holding their hands or standing in their
midst. Only the rarest of creatures and magical items have the
ability to bestow magic resistance upon another.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Magic resistance is given as
a percentile number. For a magical effect to have any chance of
success, the magic resistance must be overcome. The target (the one
with the magic resistance) rolls percentile dice. If the roll is
higher than the creature's magic resistance, the spell has a normal
effect. If the roll is equal to or less than the creature's magic
resistance, the spell has no effect on the creature.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Magic resistance enables a
creature to ignore the effects of spells and spell-like powers. It
does not protect the creature from magical weapon attacks or from
natural forces that can be a direct or accidental result of a spell.
Nor does it prevent the protected creature from using his own
abilities or from casting spells and using magical items. It can be
effective against both individually targeted spells and, within
limits, area-effect spells.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a magic resistance roll

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Magic resistance applies only
if the successful casting of a spell would directly affect the
resistant creature or item. Thus, magic resistance is effective

at a creature or item) or a</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>

(damaging the area the creature or item is in).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Magic resistance is not
effective against an earthquake caused by a spell. While the creature
could suffer injury or death falling into a chasm the spell opens
under its feet, the magical energy of the spell was directed at the
ground, not the creature. Magic resistant creatures are not immune to
events that occur as the consequence of spells, only to the direct
energy created or released by a spell.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Player characters do not

Undead</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One important, and
potentially life-saving, combat ability available to priests and
paladins is the ability to turn undead. This is a special power
granted by the character's deity. Druids cannot turn undead. However,
priests of specific mythoi may be able to at the DM's option.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Through the priest or
paladin, the deity manifests a portion of its power, terrifying evil,
undead creatures or blasting them right out of existence. However,
since the power must be channeled through a mortal vessel, success is
not always assured.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When encountering undead, a
priest or paladin can attempt to turn the creatures (remember that
the paladin turns undead as if he was two levels lower--a 5th-level
paladin uses the level 3 column in Table 47). Only one attempt can be
made per character per encounter, but several different characters
can make attempts at the same time, with the results determined
individually.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Attempting to turn counts as
an action, requiring one round and occurring during the character's
turn in the initiative order. Thus, the undead might get to act
before the character can turn them. The mere presence of the
character is not enough--a touch of drama from the character is
important. Speech and gestures are important, so the character must
have his hands free and be in a position to speak. Still, turning is
not like spellcasting and is not interrupted if the character is
attacked during the attempt.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To resolve a turning attempt,
look on Table 47. Cross-index the Hit Dice or type of the undead with
the level of the character (two levels lower for a paladin). If there
is a number listed, roll 1d20. If the number rolled is equal to or
greater than that listed, the attempt is successful. If the letter
&quot;T&quot; (for &quot;turned&quot;) appears, the attempt is
automatically succeeded without a die roll. If the letter &quot;D&quot;
(for &quot;dispel&quot;) is given, the turning utterly destroys the
undead. A dash (--) means that a priest or paladin of that level
cannot turn that type of undead. </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Up
to 2d6 undead are turned by a successful attempt. If the undead
creatures are a mixed group, the lowest Hit Dice creatures are
affected first.</i></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Only one die is rolled
regardless of the number of undead the character is attempting to
turn in a given round. The result is read individually for each type
of undead.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, Gorus, a
7th-level priest, and his party are attacked by two skeletons led by
a wight and a spectre. The turning attempt is made, resulting in a
roll of 12.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Gorus's player reads the
table for all three types of undead </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>using
the same roll--12--for all three</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
The skeletons are destroyed, as Gorus knew they would be. The wight
is turned (a 4 or better was needed) and flees. The spectre, however,
continues forward undaunted, since a 16 was needed to turn it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Undead bound by the orders of
another (e.g., skeletons) simply retreat and allow the character and
those with him to pass or complete their actions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Free-willed undead attempt to
flee the area of the turning character, until out of his sight. If
unable to escape, they circle at a distance, no closer than 10 feet
to the character, provided he continues to maintain his turning. No
further die rolls are needed.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Evil priests are normally
considered to be in league with undead creatures, or at least to
share their aims and goals. Thus, they have no ability to turn
undead. However, they can attempt to command these beings, forcing
them to do their will.	</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This is resolved in the same
way as a turning attempt. Up to 12 undead can be commanded. A &quot;T&quot;
result means the undead automatically obey the evil priest, while a
&quot;D&quot; means the undead become subservient to the evil priest.
They follow his commands to the best of their ability and
understanding until turned, commanded, or destroyed by another.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Evil priests also have the
ability to affect paladins, turning them as if they were undead.
However, since the living spirit of a paladin is far more difficult
to quell and subvert, paladins are vastly more difficult to turn.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	An evil priest attempting to
turn a paladin does so as if the priest were three levels lower than
he actually is. Thus, a 7th-level evil priest would turn paladins on
the 4th-level column. He would have only a slim chance of turning a
7th-level paladin (7 HD) and would not be able to turn one of 8th
level (using the paladin's level as the HD to be turned).</font></p>

used to control a party that has become abusive or just too powerful.
Such uses of very potent creatures should be extremely rare.</font></p>

<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Morale</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The old saying, &quot;the
best defense is a good offense&quot; is clearly true in the AD&amp;D
game. And the best way to avoid suffering damage is to beat the foe
so badly he wants to crawl under a rock or, better yet, run away.
That's where morale checks come in.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The gnoll in front of
Beornhelm smashes a mace against the fighter's shield, just as the
searing heat of lightning clips all the hair on the side of his head.
Instantly, the heat is followed by the booming thunderclap in his
ear. All the while, some vile little creature is trying to gnaw on
his shin! It's really enough to ruin an adventurer's day. But,
Beornhelm is cool, calm and in control--because the player running
him says so. The same can't be said for the monsters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In almost all situations,
players should be the ones who decide what their characters do. A DM
should never tell a player, &quot;Your character decides he doesn't
want to get hurt and runs from the fight,&quot; unless that character
is charmed and therefore controlled by the DM.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A suggestion that a character
might want to retreat, advance, open a chest, or whatever, is all
right, but a DM shouldn't force a player character to do something by
simply insisting. Only under the most unusual circumstances--charm,
magical fear, or other forced effects--should the DM dictate the
actions of a player character.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Monsters and NPCs are an
entirely different matter, however. The DM makes their decisions,
trying to think like each creature or non-player character, in turn.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In combat, thinking like a
creature mainly means deciding what actions it takes and how badly it
wants to fight. As a general rule, monsters and NPCs are no more
eager to die than player characters. Most withdraw when a fight
starts to go badly.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some panic and flee, even
casting their weapons aside. If they think they can get mercy,
brighter foes might fall to their knees and surrender. A few
bloodthirsty or brainless types might fight to the death--but this
doesn't happen too often. These are the things that make up morale,
things the DM must decide, either through role-playing or dice
rolling.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">The
Role-Playing Solution</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The first (and best) way to
handle morale is to determine it without rolling any dice or
consulting any tables. This gives the biggest range of choices and
prevents illogical things from happening. To decide what a creature
does, think about its goals and reasons for fighting.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Unintelligent
and animal intelligence creatures</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">attack and most
often for food or to protect their lair. Few ever attack for the
sheer joy of killing.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Those attacking for food
attack the things they normally hunt. A mountain lion, for example,
doesn't hunt humans as a rule, and it doesn't stalk and attack humans
as it would a deer. Such creatures normally allow a party of
adventurers to pass by unhindered. Only when the creature is close to
its lair does the chance of attack come into play. Animals often
fight to protect their territory or their young.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When they do become involved
in combat, animals and other creatures rarely fight to the death.
When hunting, they certainly try to escape, especially if they are
injured. Their interest is in food. If they can't get it easily,
they'll try again elsewhere. Most often, it is only when pressed,
with no avenue of escape, or perhaps when its young are threatened,
that an animal will sacrifice its own life.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of course, in an AD&amp;D
game, a creature can attack and fight to the death when that will
make for the most drama and excitement. For example, say a group of
characters spot a grizzly bear blocking the path ahead of them.
Instead of wisely waiting for it to shamble off, the party foolishly
puts some arrows into it. Enraged, the beast attacks the party with
berserk fury, causing serious harm and teaching them an important
lesson before it dies.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Intelligent
creatures</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">have more
complicated motivations that the need for food and shelter. The DM
decides what the creatures want. Greed hatred, fear, self-defense,
and hunger are all motivations, but they are not worth dying for.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As a guideline for
intelligent creature and NPC motivation, consider the actions of
player characters. How often do they fight to the death? Why would
they? At what point do they usually retreat?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Certainly, NPC adventurer
parties should behave similarly to player characters. After all,
their concerns are much the same as those of the player
characters--getting cash and improving themselves. They are not very
interested in dying.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	On the other hand, members of
some fanatical sects may willingly sacrifice themselves for the
cause. Even so, a few have been known to reconsider at the last
minute!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The morale of NPCs and
intelligent creatures should also jibe with known facts about his,
her, or its personality. If an NPC with the party has been portrayed
as cowardly, he probably won't willingly march into the jaws of
death. One noted for his slavish loyalty, on the other hand, might
stand his ground, dying to protect his friends or master. There are
many choices, and the AD&amp;D game works best when a person, not the
dice, makes the choice.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a creature or NPC fails
a morale check, its first concern is to escape or avoid whatever
situation caused the check in the first place. If it is being
overpowered in combat, it tries to flee. If the party's mage is
blasting lightning bolts about, it tries to get away from him.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If there is no place to go,
the NPC or monster, if it is intelligent enough, falls down and
surrenders--provided it thinks the party is likely to spare its life.
A goblin is not about to surrender to a bunch of bloodthirsty dwarves
because it knows how kindly those dwarves treat captured goblins!
Now, if there just happened to be a nice, compassionate-looking human
there, the goblin might give up if the human could promise it safety.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	How drastic a panicked
creature's flight is depends on the DM's judgment and how much over
the base morale the modified die roll was. If the roll was close to
what was needed, the creature tries to back out of the combat and
find safety nearby. If the morale check was blown badly, the creature
just forgets everything and bugs out, casting aside anything that
slows it down.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Lawful creatures normally try
to fall back in some sort of organized manner--keeping together as a
group or, at least, all fleeing to the same place. Chaotic creatures
tend to break and run in any direction that promises safety.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">As the player
characters slash through thick underbrush, they stumble across a band
of 10 gnolls gnawing on roasted game birds. Neither group is
surprised. An elf in the party shouts in the gnolls' language,
&quot;Surrender, you scum of the forest! You haven't a chance and
we'll let you keep your miserable hides.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM refuses to roll a
morale check, since the gnolls don't know if their enemies are strong
or weak. Besides, the DM sees possibilities for a nice dramatic fight
in this encounter.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Snarling, the gnolls hurl
aside their badly cooked birds. The tallest one grunts out in the
local tongue, &quot;I think you wrong, tree-thing. We win fight. We
take hides!&quot; He hefts a great mace in his hands. The two groups
attack. A furious, slashing battle ensues.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suddenly, the mage of the
party cuts loose with a</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
magic missile </i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">spell,
killing the largest of the gnolls. Now the DM rolls a morale check,
both for the magic and the loss of the leader, applying appropriate
modifiers.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM decides the gnolls are
disorganized troops--a hunting party, not a war party. This gives
them a base morale of 11. The gnolls have a -4 penalty (chaotic,
fighting mages, and more than one check required in the round),
giving an adjusted result of 7.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Two 10-sided dice are rolled,
resulting in a 3 and a 2, for a total of 5. They pass the morale
check, since the number rolled is less than their modified morale,
and they decide to keep fighting.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In the next round, an NPC
fighter with the party loses 25% of his hit points in wounds. The DM

is modified by -1 (+2 for mages on his side, -2 for his wounds, and
-1 since his employer is lawful good and he is neutral), giving him a
morale of 11. He rolls a total of 12--not good enough. He decides
he's had enough and gets out of the fight, although he only goes so

skill, ability, or resistance to various attacks can prevent harm
from coming to a character. The adventuring life carries with it
unavoidable risks. Sooner or later a character is going to be hurt.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To allow characters to be
heroic, and for ease of play, damage is handled abstractly in the
AD&amp;D game. All characters and monsters have a number of hit
points. The more hit points a creature has, the harder it is to
defeat.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Damage is subtracted from a
character's or creature's hit points. Should one of the player
characters hit an ogre in the side of the head for 8 points of
damage, those 8 points are subtracted from the ogre's total hit
points. The damage isn't applied to the head or divided among
different areas of the body.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a character hits a
monster, or vice versa, damage is suffered by the victim. The amount
of damage depends on the weapon or method of attack. In Table 44 of
the</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i> Player's
Handbook</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">, all
weapons are rated for the amount of damage they inflict to Small,
Medium, and Large targets. This is given as a die range (1d8, 2d6,
etc.)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Each time a hit is scored,
the appropriate dice are rolled and the result--damage--is subtracted
from the current hit points of the target. An orc that attacks with a
sword, for example, causes damage according to the information given
for the type of sword it uses. A troll that bites once and rends with
one of its clawed hands causes 2d6 points of damage with its bite and
1d4 + 4 points with its claw. The DM gets this information from the
Monstrous Manual.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes damage is listed as
a die range along with a bonus of +1 or more. The troll's claw
attack, above, is a good example. This bonus may be due to high
Strength, magical weapons, or the sheer ferocity of the creature's
attack. The bonus is added to whatever number comes up on the die
roll, assuring that some minimum amount of damage is inflicted.
Likewise, penalties also can be applied, but no successful attack can
result in less than 1 point of damage.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes an attack has both
a die roll and a damage multiplier. The number rolled on the dice is
boosted by the multiplier to determine how much damage is inflicted.
This occurs mainly in backstabbing attempts. In cases where damage is
multiplied, only the base damage caused by the weapon is multiplied.
Bonuses due to Strength or magic are not multiplied. Bonuses due to
Strength or magic are not multiplied; they are added after the rolled
damage is multiplied.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Player characters have a
marvelous (and, to the DM, vastly amusing) tendency to fall off
things, generally from great heights and almost always onto hard
surfaces. While the falling is harmless, the abrupt stop at the end
tends to cause damage.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a character falls, he
suffers 1d6 points of damage for every 10 feet fallen, to a maximum
of 20d6, which for game purposes can be considered terminal velocity.
This method is simple and it provides all the realism necessary in
the game. It is not a scientific calculation of the rate of
acceleration, exact terminal velocity, mass, impact energy, etc., of
the falling body.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The fact of the matter is
that physical laws can describe the exact motion of a body as it
falls through space, but relatively little is known about the effects
of impact. The distance fallen is not the only determining factor in
how badly a person is hurt. Other factors might include elasticity of
the falling body and the ground, angle of impact, shock waves through
the falling body, dumb luck, and more.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	People have actually fallen
from great heights and survived, albeit very rarely. The current
record-holder, Vesna Vulovic, survived a fall from a height of 33,330
feet in 1972, although she was severely injured. Flight-Sergeant
Nicholas S. Alkemade actually fell 18,000 feet--almost 3.5
miles--without a parachute and landed uninjured!</font></p>

affected by paralysis becomes immobile for the duration of the
spell's effect. The victim can breathe, think, see, and hear, but he
is unable to speak or move. Coherent thought needed to trigger
magical items or innate powers is still possible. Paralysis affects
only the general motor functions of the body and is not the ultimate
destroyer of powerful creatures. It can be particularly potent on
flying creatures, however.</font></p>

beholder still can use the spell-like powers of its eyes and move
about (since it levitates at will). But, on the other hand, it is not
able to move its eyestalks to aim. Since all of its eyes were most
likely facing forward at the moment of paralysis, the adventurers
cleverly spread out in a ring around the creature. To attack one or

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For each level lost, roll the
Hit Dice appropriate to the character's class and subtract that
number of hit points from the character's total (subtract the
Constitution bonus also, if applicable). If the level(s) lost was one
in which the character received a set number of hit points rather
than a die roll, subtract the appropriate number of hit points. The
adjusted hit point total is now the character's maximum (i.e., hit
points lost by energy drain are not taken as damage but are lost
permanently).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The character's experience

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All powers and abilities
gained by the player character by virtue of his former level are
immediately lost, including spells. The character must instantly
forget any spells that are in excess of those allowed for his new
level. In addition, a wizard loses all understanding of spells in his
spell books that are of higher level than he can now cast. Upon
regaining his previous level, the spellcaster must make new rolls to
see if he can relearn a spell, regardless of whether he knew it
before.</font></p>

slain instantly.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the character is drained
to less than 0 levels (thereby slain by the undead), he returns as an
undead of the same type as his slayer in 2d4 days. The newly risen
undead has the same character class abilities it had in normal life,
but with only half the experience it had at the beginning of its
encounter with the undead that slew it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The new undead is
automatically an NPC. His goals and ambitions are utterly opposed to
those he held before. He possesses great hatred and contempt for his
former colleagues, weaklings who failed</font></p>
<p class="western" >

Indeed, his main ambition could be to destroy his former companions
or cause them as much grief as possible.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Further, the newly undead NPC
is under the total control of the undead who slew it. If this master
is slain, its undead minions of lower level or fewer Hit Dice gain
one level or Hit Die for each level they drain from victims until
they reach the maximum Hit Dice for their kind. Upon reaching full
Hit Dice, these undead are able to acquire their own minions by
slaying characters.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Appropriate actions on the

from becoming undead. The steps necessary vary with each type of

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This is an all-too-frequent
hazard faced by player characters. Bites, stings, deadly potions,
drugged wines, and bad food all await characters at the hands of
malevolent wizards, evil assassins, hideous monsters, and incompetent
innkeepers. Spiders, snakes, centipedes, scorpions, wyverns, and some
giant frogs all have poisons deadly to characters. Wise heroes
quickly learn to respect and fear such creatures.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The strength of different
poisons varies wildly and is frequently overestimated. The bite of
the greatly feared black widow spider kills a victim in the United
States once every other year. Only about 2% of all rattlesnake bites
prove fatal.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the other extreme, there
are natural poisons of intense lethality. Fortunately, such poisons
tend to be exotic and rare--the golden arrow-poison frog, the western
taipan snake, and the stone fish all produce highly deadly poisons.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Further, the effect of a
poison depends on how it is delivered. Most frequently, it must be
injected into the bloodstream by bite or sting. Other poisons are
effective only if swallowed; assassins favor these for doctoring
food. By far the most deadly variety, however, is contact poison,
which need only touch the skin.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

debilitating and paralyzing effects of some poisons, it is possible
to create new varieties.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, always introduce
poisons and poisonous creatures with great care, especially when

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The AD&amp;D combat system
does not call for specific wounds--scars, broken bones, missing
limbs, and the like. And in most cases they shouldn't be applied.
Remember that this is a game of heroic fantasy. If characters were to
suffer real-life effects from all their battles and combats, they
would quickly be some of the sorriest and most depressing characters
in the campaign world.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It's hard to get excited when
your character is recovering from a broken leg and a dislocated
shoulder suffered in a fall off a 15-foot wall. It is not recommended
that characters suffer specific injuries. In general, stick with the
basic pool of hit points.</font></p>

This Injury Necessary?</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before adding specific
injuries to a campaign, consider all the factors. If the injury is
one that can be healed, such as a broken arm, how long does this
healing take? What are the effects on the character while the arm
heals? Is there some quick way to get healed? Will the player still
be able to have fun while his character is an invalid? Only after
considering these questions satisfactorily should a specific injury
be used.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	DMs can use specific injuries
to lessen a character's ability scores. A member of the party might
acquire a prominent scar, lowering his Charisma by a point. Although,
in this case, you'll want a ready explanation of why a scar had this
effect, as in some instances a scar can actually enhance the
personality of a person. It can make him look tougher, more
mysterious, more worldly, more magnetic, all things that could
conceivably increase a character's Charisma.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Similarly, the loss of a
character's finger or eye could be used as an excuse to lower an
excessively high Dexterity. Loss of an arm could reduce Strength
(among other things).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Don't overdo this brute force
approach to player control. Players get attached to their characters;
they get used to thinking of them and role-playing them a particular
way. Mess with this too much and you'll find players deserting your
campaign.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Within reason, it's okay to
leave a character physically marked. This leads to good role-playing.
It adds to the feeling that each character is unique, making one
player's fighter, wizard, or whatever different from all others. A
scar here, an eye patch there, or a slight limp all result in more of
an individual character and thus one more interesting to role-play.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	But in these cases physical
effects are tailoring the character, not punishing the player. Always
try to be fair and ask the question, &quot;Would I want to role-play
such a character?&quot; If the answer is no, then it's likely the
player won't want to either. Don't load players with handicaps--their
characters have enough of a challenge as it is.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once a character is wounded,
his player will naturally want to get him healed. Characters can heal
either by natural or magical means. Natural healing is slow, but it's
available to all characters. Magical healing may or may not be
available, depending on the presence of spellcasters or magical
devices. Healing can never restore more hit points to a character
than his maximum hit point total.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Characters heal naturally at
a rate of 1 hit point per day of rest. Rest is defined as low
activity--nothing more strenuous than riding a horse or traveling
from one place to another. Fighting, running in fear, lifting a heavy
boulder, or any other physical activity, prevents resting, since it
strains old wounds and may even reopen them.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a character has complete
bed-rest (doing nothing for an entire day), he can regain 3 hit
points for the day. For each complete week of bed rest, the character
can add any Constitution hit point bonus he might have to the base of
21 points (3 points per day) he regained during that week.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In both cases above, the

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Spells, potions, and magical
devices can speed the process of healing considerably. The specifics
of such magical healing methods are described in the spell
descriptions in the</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>
Player's Handbook,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
and in this book for magical items. By using these methods, wounds
close instantly and vigor is restored.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Magical healing is
particularly useful in the midst of combat or in preparation for a
grievous encounter. Remember, however, that the characters' opponents
are just as likely to have access to magical healing as the player
characters--an evil high priest is likely to carry healing spells to
bestow on his own followers and guards. Healing is not, of itself, a
good or evil act.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Remember that under no
circumstances can a character be healed to a point greater than his
original hit point total. For example, say a character has 30 hit
points, but suffers 2 points of damage in a fight. A while later, he
takes an additional point of damage, bringing his current hit point
total to 27. A spellcaster couldn't restore more than 3 points to
him, regardless of the healing method used.</font></p>

points reach 0, a character also runs the risk of dying abruptly when
he suffers massive amounts of damage. A character who suffers 50 or

happen in a fantasy world.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As a general guideline,
inescapable deaths should be avoided--characters always should have
some chance to escape a hopeless situation, preferably by using
common sense and intelligence. This maintains the interest of the
players and helps them retain their trust in the DM.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, if a situation of
inescapable death occurs, the character dies, and there is no need to
play such a situation out round-by-round. Allow the player to attempt

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The players will often
encounter situations in which it is important that a stronghold be
broken into. In these situations, the overall employment of siege
tactics should be secondary to the thrill and glory of the players
going &quot;mano-a-mano&quot; with their foes. In other words, the
battle should be the background against which the players act.
Sixteen months of siege may be realistic, but it isn't much fun!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The critical point in a siege
is that moment when the walls face a direct assault. This is
especially true in a role-playing adventure. The following table
simplifies this process of breaking down walls.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To use the table, the DM
determines what type of wall is being assaulted, and its closest
approximation on the Table. Cross-reference the type of attack being
made and roll 1D20. If the resulting roll is higher than the number
required, the attack does no significant damage; if the roll is
lower, the wall begins to give way.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For each point below the
required saving throw, the structure loses one cubic foot of
structure. For example, suppose a stone wall 10' thick fails its
saving throw by six points. The wall now loses a portion of its
structure equal to six cubic feet of area (i.e., a hole two feet
wide, three feet high, and one foot deep).</font></p>

in mounted combat with no penalties. However, steeds not trained for
combat are easily frightened by the noise and confusion.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

character gets a +1 bonus to his chance to hit creatures smaller than
his mount. Thus, a man on horseback gains a +1 bonus to his attack

not gain this bonus against another rider or a giant. Those on foot

applied to attacks against the mount, however.</font></p>

are the preferred weapons of the mounted rider. However, the type of
lance used (light, medium, or heavy) can't be greater than the size
of the horse ridden (light, medium, or heavy).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Medium and heavy lances gain
their striking power from the momentum of the mount. By themselves,
these lances are not capable of doing significant damage. Simply
stabbing someone with a heavy lance won't produce much in the way of
results. Therefore, these weapons are most effective when there's
plenty of attack space.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	During the first round of a
battle, a rider can attack with a heavy or medium lance. After this,
however, the rider must break off (most likely by continuing past his
opponent), turn his mount, and gallop back again. This series of
actions takes one round. Thus, at best, a rider can attack with a
lance once every other round.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the rider wants to
continue the fight close in, he must throw the lance to the ground
and draw another weapon. Often, lances are used for the first attack
and then discarded in favor of swords, maces, etc.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Another consideration to bear
in mind when using a lance is that lances are breakable. Heavy and
medium lances are relatively inflexible. The DM can make an Item
Saving Throw (for crushing blow) on each successful hit. A light
lance is made with a great deal of spring (bamboo or cane are common
materials). An Item Saving Throw is made only if the number needed to
hit is rolled exactly, after modifiers.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Long bows can be used by
those with specialization (if this is used). Heavy crossbows can be
fired once, but cannot be reloaded by a mounted man since the bracing
and pull is inadequate.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the mount is not moving,
the rider can fire normally (with full ROF and chance to hit). When
firing while on the move, the rider has his rate of fire reduced by
one. A 2-shot-per-turn ROF becomes a 1 shot every two turns; and so
on.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Certain weapons (such as the
lasso) can be used to yank a rider off his speeding mount. However,
riders with Riding proficiency can attempt to stop short, reining the
horse in before the rope is fully played out. If the check is
successful, the horse stops before the line goes taut. The rider
remains mounted, albeit still lassoed.</font></p>

Combat (Tournament)</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	On first examination, aerial
combat seems just like normal ground combat. The only real difference
is that the ground can be anywhere from 10 feet to 100 miles (or
more!) below. This little difference, however, leads to a number of
special problems and effects that never come into play during a
ground battle.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The biggest difference is
that everyone (except the rare creature able to hover) must keep
moving forward. Stop flying and the result is a fall, often with
disastrous results. Two flying creatures simply cannot face off in
toe-to-toe combat.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Battles are fought in a
series of passes, as each creature tries to swoop down on the other,
attack, wheel, and return before the other can respond. Speed and
maneuverability are even more important factors in an aerial battle
than in an ordinary one.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Another big difference is
that aerial battles are fought in three dimensions. While this is
hardly surprising to creatures of the air, it often causes the plans
and tactics of groundlings, accustomed to only two dimensions, to go
awry.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In the air, attacks can come
from ahead, alongside, above, behind, below, or any combination of
these. A paladin riding a pegasus may find himself beset by harpies
swooping from high and in front, low and to the right side, high and
from the rear, and even straight down from above. Clearly, standard
methods of defense and attack that work on the ground are going to do
him little good here.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are two ways of running
aerial battles: the Tournament rules and the Optional rules. The
Tournament rules can be used in any situation, but rely on the
descriptions of the DM and the imaginations of the players for much
of their effect. The Optional rules provide a more detailed system
for fighting aerial battles with miniatures. The Tournament rules
begin below.</font></p>

Classes</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	How tightly a creature is
able to turn is an important factor in aerial combat. To measure
this, all flying creatures have a maneuverability class ranking from
A to E (with A being the best). In general, creatures with a better
maneuverability class can attack more often and more effectively.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

virtually total command over their movements in the air; it is their
home. They can maneuver in the air with the same ease as a normal
person on the ground, turning at will, stopping quickly, and hovering
in place. For them, flying is the same as walking or running.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Class A creatures can face
any given direction in a round, and are virtually impossible to
outmaneuver in the air. Fighting in the air is no different from
fighting on the ground for them, so they can attack every round. This
class includes creatures from the elemental plane of Air and
creatures able to fly magically, without wings.</font></p>

maintained by moving at least half the normal movement rate (although
some magical items are exempted from this). Creatures in this class

Dragons, although huge, are amazingly maneuverable and also fall into

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Levitating creatures don't
truly fly, and their movement is generally limited to up or down.
Levitating creatures that are able to move freely are assumed to be
class A. Otherwise, the power does not grant any maneuverability and

<font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Altitude</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The relative elevation of
combatants is important for a variety of reasons, but as far as
combat goes, it has little real effect. If flying creatures wish to
fight, they must all be flying at approximately the same height. If
one of the creatures flees and the others do not pursue, he gets
away. Simple.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Altitude affects the action.
The DM should keep the following guidelines in mind as he listens to
what players want to do and decides how creatures and NPCs will
react.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Creatures cannot charge those
above them, although those above can dive, gaining the charge bonus.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Only creatures with natural
weapons or riders with &quot;L&quot; weapons, such as a lance, can
attack a creature below them. Attacks from below suffer a -2 penalty
to the attack roll, as the reach and angle make combat difficult.</font></p>

<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Combat
Procedure</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Aerial combat is based on
maneuverability. When flying creatures fight, compare the
maneuverability classes of the different combatants. If these are all
identical, the combat is conducted normally. When maneuverability
classes differ, creatures with the better class gain several
advantages.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For each difference in class,
the more maneuverable flyer subtracts one from its initiative die
rolls. Its maneuverability increases its ability to strike quickly
and to strike areas that are difficult to protect.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Breath

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">are more
problematic in aerial combat than on the ground. Creatures using
breath weapons find their fields of fire slightly more restricted,
making the attack harder to use. Dragons, in particular, find it
difficult to use their breath weapons to the side and rear while
flying forward.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Those within a 60-degree arc
of the front of the creature roll saving throws vs. breath weapons
normally. Creatures outside this arc save with a +2 bonus to the die
roll.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Missile
Fire</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">is also
difficult in aerial combat. Those mounted on a flying creature or
magical device suffer all the penalties for mounted bowfire. Hovering
is the same as standing still and incurs no penalty.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Characters using missile fire
while levitating suffer a -1 cumulative penalty for each round of
fire, up to a maximum of -5. Levitation is not a stable platform, and
the reaction from the missile fire creates a gradually increasing
rocking motion. A round spent doing nothing allows the character to
regain his balance. Medium and heavy crossbows cannot be cocked by
levitating characters, since there is no point of leverage.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Air-to-Ground
Combat</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When attacking a creature on
the ground (or one levitating and unable to move), the flyer's
attacks are limited by the number of rounds needed to complete a
pass.</font></p>

<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>	A dragon flies out of its
cave to attack the player characters as they near its lair. On the
first round it swoops over them, raking the lead character with its
claws. Since its maneuverability is C, it then spends a round
wheeling about and swooping back to make another attack on the third
round of combat. Of course, during this time, its flight will more
than likely take it out of range of the player characters.</i></font></p>

<font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Escaping</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a creature tries to
break off from combat, its ability to escape depends on its
maneuverability and speed. Creatures both faster and more
maneuverable than their opponents can escape combat with no
penalties. The free attack for fleeing a combat is not allowed, since
the other flyer is also in motion (probably in the opposite
direction).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a creature is faster, but
not more maneuverable, it can break off by simply outrunning its
opponent. The other cannot keep pace. In this case, a free attack for
fleeing is allowed.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the creature is slower,
regardless of maneuverability, an initiative roll must be made
(modified by the maneuverability of the flyers). If the fleeing
creature's initiative roll is lower than that of the pursuer, the
creature has managed to flee, although suffering the usual attack for
fleeing.</font></p>

<font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Damage</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Any winged creature that
loses more than 50% of its hit points cannot sustain itself in the
air and must land as soon as possible. The creature can glide safely
to the ground, but cannot gain altitude or fly faster than half its
normal movement rate. If no safe landing point is available, the
creature is just out of luck. Since the circumstances of a crash
landing can vary greatly, the exact handling of the situation is left
to the DM. The falling rules may come in handy, though a vivid
imagination may be even more helpful.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	These optional rules provide
more precision about just what is happening in an aerial battle.
However, these battles require the use of miniatures or counters and
generally take longer to resolve. All of the aerial combat rules
above remain in effect except where specifically contradicted below.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Movement</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Movement is measured in
inches (1 inch = 10 feet of movement) and the pieces are moved on the
tabletop or floor. The maneuverability classes determine how far a
figure can turn in a single round. A protractor is handy for figuring
this. Turns can be made at any point in the round, provided the total
number of degrees turned is not exceeded in the round and there is at
least 1 inch of movement between turns.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Climbing
and Diving</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Players keep track of the
altitude of their flyers by noting the current altitude on a slip of
paper. Like movement, this can be recorded as inches of altitude. A
creature can climb 1 inch for every inch of forward movement.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Creatures of class C and
worse have a minimum air speed, and they must spend at least half
their movement rate going forward. Thus, they cannot fly straight up
and can only climb at a maximum of 1/2 their normal movement rate.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Diving creatures gain speed,
earning an additional inch to their movement for every inch they
dive, up to their maximum movement rate. Thus, a creature able to fly
12 could move 24 by diving for its entire movement, since each inch
of diving adds one inch of movement.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A diving creature must fly
the full distance it gains diving, although it need not fly its full
normal movement. A creature with a movement of 12 could not dive 9
and fly only 6 forward. It must move forward at least 9, the distance
it dove.</font></p>

<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Attacking</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Since the exact positions of
the flying units are marked by miniatures, several abstractions for
aerial combat are not used. Die roll modifiers for maneuverability
are ignored. These simulate the ability of more acrobatic creatures
gaining an advantage over clumsier flyers. When playing with
miniatures or counters, this task is left to the players.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Likewise, the number of
rounds required to make a pass are not used, as this becomes evident
from the position of the pieces.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a diving creature makes
an attack, it is considered to be charging. Charging creatures gain
the normal combat bonus. Lances and spears inflict double damage in a
charge. Further, creatures with talons or claws cause double damage
when they hit during a dive.</font></p>

</b></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The greatest factor in
fighting underwater is overcoming the resistance of the water. Even
though a weapon still retains its mass and density, the resistance of
the water greatly weakens the impact of any blow. Thus, only thrust
weapons can be used effectively underwater (except for those
possessing magical items that enable free action).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thrown and hurled weapons
(except nets) are useless underwater. Of the missile weapons, only
specially made crossbows can be used effectively underwater. Even so,
all rangers on these weapons are reduced by half.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Nets are particularly
effective in underwater combat. They tend to remain spread once
opened, and characters should find them useful for close-in combat.
Properly weighted, nets can be thrown by tossing them with a slight
spin, so that the force of rotation keeps the lines taut. The range
is very short, only 1' for every point of the thrower's Strength.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Characters in a role-playing
game strive for many things—fame, glory, experience, among them.
But for those who are not fully satisfied with such intangible
rewards, there is one other goal—fortune.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Strands of glittering golden
chains, stacks of silver coin, heaps of marten fur, bejeweled crowns,
enameled sceptres, silken cloths, and powerful magical items all wait
to be discovered—or wrested from the grasp of powerful monsters.
With such treasures awaiting, how could any bold adventurer be
content to remain peacefully at home?</font></p>

Needs Money?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Treasure is more than just a
goal, a measure of material wealth, however. &quot;It takes money to
get money,&quot; so the old saying goes, and for adventurers one
could even say, &quot;It takes money to stay alive.&quot; As
characters survive and succeed, their challenges become greater and
more deadly.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At first level a simple suit
of studded armor, a stout pair of boots, and a few simple spells were
all a character needed; at higher levels such simple impediments no
longer suffice. Faced with terrible foes, characters quickly discover
that they need strong armors, barded horses, a variety of weapons,
fortifications, men-at-arms, potions, scrolls, and potent magical
items.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	These are the kinds of things
the characters have to find, make, or buy. And however they go about
acquiring them, they're going to need money. In a sense, then,
treasure is also a method of measuring a character's power. Even a
low-level character with money and magic to spare is more than a
match for an impoverished fellow of higher level. Thus, getting rich
and getting ahead are rewards in and of themselves.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Forms of
Treasure</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are many different
kinds of treasure. Some of these are obvious, their approximate value
known to all. Others are less easy to spot, their value more
difficult to determine.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The simplest treasures are
items of set value—gold, silver, platinum, and copper coins.
Virtually anyone can tell the worth of these. Those with a trained
eye can assess the value of semi-precious and precious stones, both
cut and uncut. A trained jeweler, goldsmith, or silversmith can
appraise man's work in precious metals—plateware, necklaces,
brooches, tiaras, bracelets, rings, and other pieces of jewelry.
Tradesmen can evaluate the handiwork of their craft, be it
enamelware, blown glass, statuary, or delicate embroidery.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Overeager adventurers can
easily overlook vast treasures in the form of common goods. Few pay
attention to bolts of fine linen, stacks of sable marten fur, casks
of wine, or tons of raw iron ore, yet these can be worth great
fortunes. Not every fortune shines, glitters, or can even be touched.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	What if the characters find a
sheaf of cracked papers in an ancient horde, and one of the papers
turns out to be a long-lost land deed? Is it valuable? Could the
characters use it to enforce a claim? Documents granting land,
privileges, titles, offices, and rights of taxation (or freedom from
it) are all valuable. The characters may not wish to become
land-owners, but they can certainly find some merchant willing to pay
cash money for the right.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, there are magical
items, desired and coveted by virtually every player character. These
items give the character power beyond his level. They excite the
imagination, and fill the campaign with mysterious wonder and
romance. Carefully chosen and carefully awarded, magical items add an
exotic element important to any AD&amp;D game.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM places, awards, and
controls the treasures that appear in his campaign. The amount of
treasure, both monetary and magical, the characters receive will have
great effects on the development of the campaign. For this reason,
several questions should be answered before play begins:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Is the world poor in magical
items, such that the discovery of a simple potion will be seen as a
great reward? Or is it rich in magical items, such that the player
characters will have many and will use them often just to survive?
Will their supply of magical items be so great as to render them all
but unstoppable?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Will the player characters be
forced to undertake dangerous adventures just to have food from day
to day, or will they have so much wealth that their adventures will
involve those of the highest levels of society and power? Will the
characters have too much money, making them difficult to coerce,
bribe, threaten, or even challenge? Will they be poor (and, possibly,
depressed and frustrated)?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Only the DM can answer these
questions. And answer them he should, for they will shape the
campaign as surely as any other single factor.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One given in the AD&amp;D
game is that there is a significant amount of treasure (monetary and
magical) that is not circulated in the society. These treasures are
not used to purchase goods or pay for services. They do not collect
interest in banks (a foreign concept to the age, anyway). They do not
represent collateral used to secure loans or maintain prestige. They
are not the underpinnings of monetary systems. They are just piles of
unused treasure, apparently forgotten, their potential unrealized. By
normal standards, this is an illogical situation. So, just why is
there so much treasure laying around?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now, it is not important to
create a detailed background that goes into the economic theories of
dragon-hoarding or the supply-and-demand trade structures of dwarves.
But it doesn't hurt to look at some of the basic premises behind all
this loose treasure. Take these three related premises:</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Once the world

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The world has
fallen into a dark age, since now these same hoards are eagerly
sought after by adventurers and there are few governments able to
mint such amounts of coinage.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	From these premises, the DM
begins to create a background for his campaign world. Here are some
possibilities:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once in ages long before the
present time, there was a Golden Age of learning and culture. (It
could have been the Reign of the Elven Lords, the Empire of the
Dwarves, the Great Age of Peace, the Time Before the Coming of Man,
or the Rule of Good King Haring.)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Then came a great disaster
and evil times. (Suddenly the Dragon-Fire began, the Sinking of the
Gruen Mountains occurred, the Darkling invaded, Man arrived, or
Therope usurped King Haring's throne.)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now, the world is slowly
beginning to recover from this disastrous time, but much of what once
was has been lost. There are hidden treasures of bygone ages, ancient
ruins, forgotten wonders, and mighty magics now lost.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Ancient civilizations, now in
ruins, are the source of many of the treasures adventurers seek. Of
course, there are also new treasures being made and amassed. some of
which are ripe for the picking.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Other deductions could be
made and different premises reached from the same beginning. The ones
given above provide a broad range of excuses for adventures, both for
the players and the DM. Recovering that which was lost leads to all
manner of possibilities: treasure maps, ruined empires overswept by
desert, legends of powerful wizards with spells now unheard of,
magical devices of unknown function, relics and artifacts from the
previous age, even greater powers no longer worshiped.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Who's
Got the Treasure?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The next question relating to
treasure hoards is just who assembles these treasures and to what
end? The answer can be divided into two simple categories, the
unintelligent and the intelligent creature. Unintelligent creatures
here refers not to those totally mindless beings, rather to those of
animal nature for whom wealth has no meaning.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Unintelligent
Creatures:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Few
unintelligent creatures set out with the intention of amassing a
fortune. Such treasures grow by chance and happenstance.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The remains of victims
dragged back to the creature's lair may include what fortune, arms,
armor, and magical items that victim was carrying. These, unsavory
and indigestible, could be thrown aside or scattered among the bones
and refuse of previous meals.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Fortunately for adventurers,
most animals have some sanitary habits and regularly clean their dens
of refuse, creating small garbage dumps just outside their doors.
Thus, the unwanted litter from the aerie of a giant eagle could be
scattered around the base of its tree, while the remains of a cave
bear's kill could be found somewhere near the opening to its den.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the same time, animals
(and animal-like monsters) often have a fascination with the
strangest of objects. Packrats and magpies are known to carry off
shiny objects, pet ferrets will carry off pennies and shoes, and
birds will weave all manner of things into their nests. Thus it is
possible for virtually any item of interest to be found in the lair
of a creature.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There won't be many items in
a lair, since few animals make an industry of such gathering.
However, the nest of a giant otter might include a set of leather
armor and fine silks for bedding material, while the nest of a roc
could have a magical rope woven into it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In the rarest of instances,
the creature could actually eat its treasure, though hardly by
design. This is most often the case for creatures lacking the limbs
to separate the edible from the inedible and especially for those
with voracious appetites. Sharks' bellies have been known to hold
such strange items as license plates, suits of armor, hubcaps, and
other indigestible bits of metal. In adventuring, such instances
should be limited to beasts with massive maws (purple worms, killer
whales, and gelatinous cubes).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, there are a few
creatures that actually feed on items others consider treasure. The
beast may eat gems or precious metals. Of course, such creatures are
not likely to have a sizeable hoard, and treasures found by them will
not remain around forever.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Intelligent
Creatures:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Here, the DM can
begin ascribing emotions and motives. Intelligent creatures may hoard
because of greed and avarice. They may do so for social status or
material comforts. Indeed, many normal reasons can be given. However,
the reasons are not always clearly apparent.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	While a hobgoblin may kill
and steal to gain a treasure he can use to become the chief of his
tribe or to buy goods from unscrupulous merchants, what are the
reasons for a dragon to build a treasure hoard? Dragons don't go into
town and buy goods, and they don't pay builders to construct homes.
They just don't seem to have any use for the vast sums of money they
collect (and collect they do!).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For dragons and other
intelligent creatures, the DM must create more bizarre and alien
motives. Dragons may hoard treasure because they are obsessive about
such things. They may have the notion that they are the guardians and
recoverers of those things of the earth. They may simply feel it is
their right to possess all that they can. Within their own
relationships, the size of a hoard may have some bearing on the
perceived might of the creature. It could even be that the wondrous
beauty of treasure items brings an inner harmony and peace to the
creature.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even for those intelligent
creatures with understandable motives, things are apt to be a bit
different from normal. A hobgoblin society is vastly different from
that of humans or most other player character races. Hobgoblins don't
go to cities and spend money on palaces, fine drink, and elaborate
gardens. Their expenditures are apt to be much more brutal or
mundane. At the same time they do not have an economy as developed as
that of human society. Perhaps they need vast sums of money because
the price relationships are so bizarre.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Weapons may be astronomical
in price and armor outlandish. Powerful chieftains may demand regular
gifts and tribute from their underlings. Such payments may be made
eagerly since death is the alternative. Indeed such a system of
gifting may be culturally ingrained, each warrior attempting to prove
he is still fit to be a member of the tribe.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Everything above
notwithstanding, it isn't necessary to justify every hoard in
existence. However, doing so provides clues about the size of a
treasure and how the owner might react to someone trying to snatch
it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A dragon might take an
extreme view of anyone taking even the slightest amount of treasure
from its vast pile. A hobgoblin might go berserk if the characters
attempt to rob him. The hobgoblin's companions might take little
interest in their friend's problem. The player characters represent a
threat, but after all, each hobgoblin must prove he can defend
himself.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	On the other hand, looting
the chieftain's treasure room would almost certainly lead to
upheavals within the tribe. The chief is bound by the same customs as
his warriors, and if he can't protect his treasures, he doesn't
deserve to be chieftain—at least by this particular philosophy.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Intelligent monsters will
take precautions to guard their treasure that would never dawn on
unintelligent beasts. The hobgoblin chieftain isn't going to leave
his treasury unguarded.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, he isn't going
to trust his own guards, either, and so is likely to have the
treasury rigged with at least one (and probably several) dangerous
traps. Should he be so lucky, the chieftain will even have a trained
guardbeast or two to discourage thieves.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even a lowly hobgoblin
warrior is going to make an effort to protect what is his. If his
horde is small, he may carry his wealth with him at all times. He may
bury it where only he can find it. He may place it in a trapped and
locked chest, preferably one that is chained to the wall or floor.
This is not a society with an overabundance of love and trust, after
all.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A dragon, at the other
extreme, may simply consider his reputation sufficient deterrent.
Certainly this is true while the dragon is present! (And player
characters should never just come across an unoccupied dragon hoard.)</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It is important for the DM to
distinguish between placed treasures and those found with random
encounters. The scale of the two is vastly different.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Monster descriptions in the
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Monstrous Compendium</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
differentiate between treasures found in a creature's lair, den, or
base and those carried by individuals. Treasure gained through a
random encounter will be smaller than treasure gained through a
planned encounter. If a random treasure is larger or more significant
than a placed one, the players are going to remember and value the
random encounter more than the plot.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Treasures should be used to
build the adventure, develop a plot, and reward intelligent and
daring play. If they just appear randomly, not only is the DM
throwing away a useful adventure-building device, he is threatening
his overall campaign. In general, a large treasure should be a
planned part of an adventure, a way to motivate players, or a goal to
be achieved by the characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And remember, as important as
treasure is, it need not be the sole motivator for a story. Indeed,
there are times when it will be unimportant to the adventure. In
these cases, the plot doesn't need the outside motivation of cash to
interest the players. Still, small rewards should still be made
available to the players. A treasure reward, no matter how small,
gives the players the feeling that their characters are succeeding
and moving ahead.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For all his good intentions,
sooner or later the DM is likely to err in the awarding of treasure.
Either he will award too little or hand out too much. The first is
just tight-fistedness; the second leads to high-powered,
low-role-playing campaigns (sometimes called &quot;Monty Haul''
dungeons).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now, if both DM and players
enjoy a particular type of campaign and are having a good time, there

Little Treasure</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In the case of a tight-fisted
DM, the most obvious signs that the players are not having fun are
frustration, cynicism, and low expectations. If the characters are
not finding treasures commensurate to the risks they took, the
players are going to wonder if all the effort of playing is really
worth it. They become frustrated when, upon solving a devious trap,
they discover a pittance, or nothing at all.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Their cynicism shows as they
start to make snide remarks about the level of rewards they have
received or are likely to get for future efforts. Finally, they just
begin to expect less and less from the DM's campaign, until it
reaches the point where they expect nothing and they go home! In such
a campaign, the DM may have a fine time, creating detailed settings
and elaborate adventures. But if he does not have the enthusiasm of
his players, there isn't much point in playing.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Such a campaign can succeed
if there are other rewards that involve the players in the game.
Perhaps there are ample opportunities for character advancement or
personality development. The characters may have the opportunity to
play a decisive role in world affairs. These things are possible, but
only a DM of extraordinary skill can overcome the drawbacks he has
created.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Fortunately, the problems of
too little treasure are easily fixed—simply introduce more treasure
into the campaign. No adjustments need to be made to the characters.
The treasures available in the game world can be increased without
the players even aware that the change has been effected.</font></p>

<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the other extreme, the
problems of too much treasure are not so easily solved. Here players
may enjoy the game—and why not? Their characters are doing quite
well. They have sufficient money and magic to best any situation the
DM can devise.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, the DM seldom has
the same enjoyment. He is faced with the task of topping the last
lucrative adventure. He must make each adventure a greater challenge
than the last. While this is true for all DMs, it is grossly
exaggerated for the DM who has given out too much: How do you top the
adventure where the fighter got the Hammer of Thor or some equally
valuable item?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Invariably, the players reach
a point where they, too, become frustrated. Everything is the
same—&quot;Oh, we did this before,&quot; or &quot;Ho-hum. Another
Sword of Instant Monster Destruction.&quot; Soon there are no
challenges left, because the characters have earned everything in the
book!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Fixing such a situation is
far from easy. The first thing to do is to stop giving out so much
treasure in future adventures. Even this isn't as simple as it
sounds, since players have already had their expectations built up.
Imagine playing for months or years in a world where you routinely
find 5 magical items and tens of thousands of gold pieces each
adventure and then, one day, finding only two or three magical items
and a thousand gold pieces! Still, painful as it may be for players,
cutting back on future treasure hauls is a must.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The second part of the fix is
far more difficult—remove from the campaign some of what has
already been given. Most players won't voluntarily surrender their
goods and equipment just because the DM made a mistake. The inventive
DM must be inventive, resorting to new and bizarre taxes, accidents,
theft, and anything else he can think of. Use a given method only
once and be sure to allow the characters a fair chance. Nothing will
upset and anger players more than having their characters jerked
about like a dog on a chain.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes the situation has
just gotten so far out of hand that there is no way to bring it back
under control. For example, because the DM has given out excessive
magic, the players have near-godlike powers. They have used </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>wishes</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
to exceed ability score limits and enhance their classes with
permanent abilities. They have fashioned other-planar stronghold
impervious to anything. They have reached the point where they are
dictating the structure of the game to the DM. There is only one
cure—starting over.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Require all the characters to
retire, and begin anew with 1st-level characters, being careful not
to make the same mistakes again. The players may grumble and
complain, but if the DM is fair, the complaints should eventually be
overcome. To this end, the DM may even want to set the new characters
in a different part of his campaign world, one that has not been
explored before.</font></p>

<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One of the most important
types of treasure a character can earn is a magical item. Not only
does the item act as an immediate reward for good play, it increases
the power and survivability of the character. Such items add to the
wonder and romance of the game, allowing the character to perform
feats far beyond those of ordinary mortals. Rare indeed is the player
character who does not want the rewards of magical items.</font></p>

and Magical Items</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Like other treasures, magical
items may be found in the lairs of unintelligent and intelligent
monsters. Random encounters with unintelligent monsters shouldn't
yield magical items (except in rare cases where the beast has
swallowed them). After all, why (let alone how) would a giant snake
carry around a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>sword
+1?</i></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Unintelligent creatures may
have a few items in or near their lairs, the former possessions of
their victims. Even this will be rare, however. Such monsters don't
recognize the worth of magical items and seldom make a special effort
to collect them. The comments relating to treasure and unintelligent
creatures can be applied here.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Intelligent creatures, on the
other hand, tend to value magical items above other items of
treasure. They recognize such items for what they are (unless the
item is very well disguised or unique) and take them. Knowing such
items can be used to their benefit, they will attempt to learn the
function of the item. A creature that can use an item will use it.
Useful magical items that are part of treasure will therefore be in
the creature's hands, not hidden away.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, take the
treasure of the hobgoblin chieftain. Over the years he has come into
possession of a number of minor magical items. Currently the tribe's
treasure includes three potions of healing, a scroll of wizard
spells, a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>sword +1,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
and two suits of </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>chain
mail +1.</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> This is
not a horde the crafty, old chieftain is going to ignore.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He wears one suit of armor at
all times, carries the sword at his side, and has the three potions
hidden away but close at hand should he need them. The other suit of
armor he gives to the most faithful of his bodyguards.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As for the scroll, since
nobody in the tribe can use it, it is rather carelessly tossed in
with the rest of the treasure in the chieftain's strongroom. He
figures to trade it for something useful the next time a renegade
merchant comes around. Player characters who hope to get the tribe's
magical items will have to wrest them, literally, from the fingers of
the hobgoblins. That's something to make the earning of magic more of
a challenge.</font></p>

<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Buying
Magical Items</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As player characters earn
more money and begin facing greater dangers, some of them will begin
wondering where they can buy magical items. Using 20th-century,
real-world economics, they will figure there must be stores that buy
and sell such goods. Naturally they will want to find and patronize
such stores. However, no magical stores exist.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before the DM goes rushing
off to create magical item shops, consider the player characters and
their behavior. Just how often do player characters sell those
potions and scrolls they find? Cast in a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>sword
+1?</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> Unload a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>horn
of blasting</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> or a
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>ring of free action?</i></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	More often than not, player
characters save such items. Certainly they don't give away one-use
items. One can never have too many </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>potions
of healing</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> or
scrolls with extra spells. Sooner or later the character might run
out. Already have a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>sword
+1?</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> Maybe a
henchman or hireling could use such a weapon (and develop a greater
respect for his master). Give up the only </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>horn
of blasting</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> the
party has? Not very likely at all.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It is reasonable to assume
that if the player characters aren't giving up their goods, neither
are any non-player characters. And if adventurers aren't selling
their finds, then there isn't enough trade in magical items to
sustain such a business.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even if the characters do
occasionally sell a magical item, setting up a magic shop is not a
good idea. Where is the sense of adventure in going into a store and
buying a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>sword +1?</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
Haggling over the price of a wand? Player characters should feel like
adventurers, not merchants or greengrocers.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Consider this as well: If a
wizard or priest can buy any item he needs, why should he waste time
attempting to make the item himself? Magical item research is an
important role-playing element in the game, and opening a magic
emporium kills it. There is a far different sense of pride on the
player's part when using a wand his character has made, or found
after perilous adventure, as opposed to one he just bought.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, buying and trading
magic presumes a large number of magical items in the society. This
lessens the DM's control over the whole business. Logically-minded
players will point out the inconsistency of a well-stocked magic shop
in a campaign otherwise sparse in such rewards.</font></p>

or Common?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One of the things the DM
decides is just how common magic is in his campaign. Is the world
rich in magical items such that every lowly fighter has access to at
least a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>sword +1?</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
Players enjoy having a wide variety of interesting magical items, but
there's the risk of creating an out-of-control Monty Haul situation.
And a magic-rich world has consequences unforeseen by most DMs.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If magic is common, then
normal people will begin to build inventions around it. There may be
djinni-powered steam engines, crystal ball telecommunications
networks, and other very un-medieval results. This can be
entertaining, but it does drastically change the shape of the
campaign world.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The charm of discovering a
magical item is lost if everyone has one, but too few magical items
can also ruin a game. This is especially true at higher levels where
magic is so important to character survival. You don't want to kill
half the party just so the survivors can be excited at discovering a
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>sword +1.</i></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM wants each magical
treasure, no matter how small, to feel special, but at the same time
he must be able to balance the pain of its acquisition against the
reward. This is not a thing the DM can learn through formulae or
tables. It takes time and judgment.</font></p>

<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Researching
Magical Items</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One of the abilities shared
by the wizard and priest groups is their ability to construct magical
items. This is a potent ability, but it is not one easily used. As DM
you do not want your player characters constructing every magical
item available. Each one should be an accomplishment and the
springboard for a new adventure.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The wizard's ability to
research items is divided into different phases. Although a wizard
can cast a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>magic
missile</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> at 1st
level, he cannot transcribe that spell onto a scroll until he reaches
9th level. The same is true of brewing potions. Only when he reaches
11th level can a wizard attempt to create other magical items. Even
then he may not be able to create many items if he lacks the ability
to cast the necessary spells.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The priest can begin creating
scrolls at 7th level and can brew a few potions (mainly those
involving healing) at 9th level. Clerics can fabricate only a few
other magical items and cannot attempt these until they reach at
least 11th level. As with the wizard, their ability even then may be
limited by the spells they have access to at the time.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Creating a magical item is
much like researching a new spell. The DM and the player must
cooperate and work together to bring about the desired goal. However,
there are differences.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In magical item research, the
desired goal is usually well-known to both the player and the DM. The
player says, &quot;Rupert wants to create a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>potion
of clairaudience.</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&quot;
The effect is known; what must be done to create it isn't. Therefore,
once the player has stated his desire, the DM decides what materials,
formulae, spells, and rites must be acquired and/or performed to
create the item.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once the DM knows this, the
player can proceed. </font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>He
does not tell the player what he needs to do! </b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It
is up to the player to discover the processes and steps required to
create a magical item, however small. He may consult a sage, seek the
guidance of a higher level spellcaster, or even use spells to call
upon greater powers.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even after learning what he
must do, the spellcaster may have to do further research to learn the
techniques required for each step. All of this will cost the
character time and money, so his dedication and resources must be
substantial if he hopes to succeed. The process of gathering the
needed information and materials is a grand excuse for one adventure
after another. This is part of the fun of the AD&amp;D game. Making a
magical item is more than just a mechanical process. It should also
be an opportunity for excitement and role-playing.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The construction of magical
items is a realm of the AD&amp;D</font><sup><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">®</font></sup><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
rules open to broad DM interpretation. Just how the DM decides to
approach it will affect the way magic is viewed in his game. There
are two basic attitudes toward the making of magical items: The
practical method and the fantastic method.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>The
practical method</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">says that
magical item manufacture is somehow tied to common sense; the
materials needed to make the item reflect the properties of the item
being constructed, and the steps required are fairly well-defined.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>potion
of climbing</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> might
require the hair of a climbing creature such as a giant spider or the
legs of a giant insect. A </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>wand
of lightning bolts</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
might have to be carved from the heart wood of an oak struck by
lightning. </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Petrification</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
might require the scales of a basilisk, a snake from a medusa, or a
feather from a live cockatrice. </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Fear</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
might require a drop of dragon sweat or the grave earth of a ghost.
In each case, the relationship between the items needed and the
object desired is relatively clear.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, the component
items themselves are physical and understandable. They may be rare,
but they can't be gathered without special preparations (other than
those required for normal adventuring). In essence, the DM creates a
&quot;grocery list'' that the player character must fill. The
character goes out adventuring, seeking out the creatures or things
that will provide him with the materials he needs.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This method has advantages,
not the least being that it simplifies the DM's task. When confronted
by a player who wants to create some bizarre magical item, the DM
need only list materials that seem appropriate to the magical effect.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the same time, however,
the practical method can be abused by clever players. They may figure
out that every monster encountered has a potential usefulness to
wizards and so begin collecting tissue samples, blood, hair, organs,
and more. They become walking butcher shops—not at all what is
desired!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, players expect
to find shops specializing in magical materials, both to sell and buy
their needed goods. This defeats the need to adventure for one's
materials and ruins part of the role-playing involved in magical item
creation.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>The
fantastical approach</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">takes a
drastically different view of magical item construction. Here, when
the player says, &quot;I want to create a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>rope
of climbing,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&quot;
the DM provides a list of impossible ingredients. It then becomes the
player's obligation to discover the means to collect each ingredient.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thus, to make the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>rope
of climbing,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> the DM
could require a skein of unspun yarn, the voice of a spider, and the
courage of a daring thief. The player would then have to discover the
meaning of each ingredient or the means to produce it. This, in turn,
could require more research and spells to accomplish the goal.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>rope
of climbing,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> the
player might solve it by finding a magical sheep whose wool is so
thick it needs no spinning. This he could form into a rope, casting
spells to give a spider voice so it can say a few words over the
cord. Finally, he could trick a renowned thief into using the
unfinished rope on a dangerous mission. After all this, the wizard
would cast the spells necessary to bind the various elements and,
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>viola—a rope of
climbing</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> would be
the result.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Folktales, myths, and legends
are filled with instances of impossible tasks and impossible
ingredients. To bind the Fenris Wolf of Norse mythology, the dwarves
forged an unbreakable chain from such things as the roots of a
mountain, the noise of a cat, and the breath of a fish. Folktales
tell of heroes and heroines faced with impossible tasks—to plow the
ocean or make a shirt without seams. Hercules was faced with Twelve
Labors, deemed impossible by others. Cullhwch (of Celtic legend) had
to produce sweet honey without bees. If the player characters aspire
to such ranks of heroism and wonder, surely they can accomplish deeds
such as these.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The fantastical method gives
the campaign a high fantasy element, for such impossible tasks are
part of the wonder and enchantment of such a world. Furthermore, it
ensures that each ingredient or step will be an adventure. Wizards
won't casually assemble their ingredients at the local magic supply
warehouse. It also provides the DM with a means to control the time
required (since assembling components can be quite a task) and a
method for draining excess cash from the character's accounts.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the same time, players can
perceive this method as too difficult and too restrictive. They may
become discouraged by the DM's demands. To alleviate this, at least
partially, the DM should balance the requirements against the potency
of the item being created.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Combining
the practical with the fantastical</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">is a workable
alternative to either method. Not every magical item can be created
by gathering the organs of creatures or the essences of rare plants,
nor does each require the spellcaster to overcome the impossible.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Simple and common magical
items (</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>potions of
healing,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> scrolls
with various spells, </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>wands
of detection</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">) could
require only that the proper things be brought together and
ensorcelled. Powerful, exotic, and highly useful items (such as a
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>sword +1</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">)
might test the spellcaster's abilities and resourcefulness, requiring
that he solve puzzles and riddles far beyond the normal ken.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The combination of the two
philosophies can even be used to explain the fact that some magical
items are so common and others so rare—potions are everywhere, but
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>maces of disruption</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
are hard to come by. Potions require simple ingredients; maces
require the moving of mountains.</font></p>

and Potions</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Just because a spellcaster
knows a spell, he isn't automatically endowed with the knowledge to
create a scroll or potion of similar function. The processes and
formulae used in each are different.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A spell on a page in a
wizard's spellbook is different from a spell contained on a scroll.
The first requires memorization and may need components or gestures
to activate. The latter needs only an utterance to be effective. A
potion, ingested to be effective, is clearly a different form of the
same thing.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Because of these differences,
a wizard must learn more of his art before attempting to make scrolls
and potions. He is assumed to have attained the appropriate degree of
training by the time he reaches 9th level. Even then the knowledge of
how to create such items does not just leap into his brain.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Rather, at ninth level he has
the potential to create such items. He knows enough basics of the art
and has learned where to look for the information he needs to make
the attempt. The exact process for each spell is still a mystery to
him.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Scrolls</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The first step in creating a
spell scroll (not a protection scroll) is for the wizard or priest to
know and be able to cast the appropriate spell—the desired spell
must exist in his spell books. If he has never seen the desired spell
or has failed to learn it, he certainly cannot create a scroll for
that spell. When creating a protection scroll, the wizard is limited
to those protective spells that fall within the purview of his art,
for example, protection from elementals, magic, and petrification.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a wizard knows the spell,
he can begin fabrication. His first step is to assemble the
appropriate materials: quill, ink, and paper. These materials can't
be commonplace items lest they mar the final product or be consumed
by the very magical energies the wizard seeks to enscribe.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>The
quill</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">used for each
spell must be fresh and unused. Lingering energies of the spell just
transcribed cling to the quill. If the quill were used again, these
energies would flow and intermingle with later attempts, causing them
to fail.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, the pen can't be
just an ordinary goose quill. It must be from a strange and magical
creature, perhaps one appropriate to the nature of the spell (the
feather of a cockatrice for a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>flesh
to stone,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> etc.).
The task of gathering the right quill can be an adventure in itself.
Quills hand-picked by the wizard himself increase the chance of
success by 5%.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>The
paper</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">or other
material upon which the scroll is inscribed must also be of fine
quality. Paper is best for this purpose, followed by parchment, and
then papyrus. Each affects the chance of success as follows:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Paper		+5%</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Parchment		 0%</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Papyrus		-5%</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>The
ink</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">is the final
consideration. In this area, the DM has the greatest leeway to demand
the most exotic ingredients and processes. The ingredients could be
simple—the ink of a giant squid mixed with the venom of a wyvern's
sting, or the musk of a giant skunk brewed with the blood of a
gorgon. They could also be complex in meaning—the tears of a
crocodile and a drop of water from the bottom of the deepest ocean,
or a drop of mead from the cup of King Thyas blended with the
lamentations of the women from the funeral of a great hero.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In general, the ink's
ingredients should relate to the overall purpose of the scroll. As
with the quill, the ink required for each spell should be different
and even each inscription of the same spell requires the batch to be
brewed anew.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After the character has
gathered and brewed all the materials, he can begin the actual
process of writing. Wizards must have their spell books at hand to
guide their work, while priests and others must work on a specially
prepared altar. The actual process of writing the scroll requires one
full day for each level of the spell inscribed.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Protection scrolls require
six days of work. During this time, the spellcaster must be
undisturbed, breaking only for food and sleep (and then for a minimum
of each). If the spellcaster halts before the transcription is
completed, the entire effort fails and all work done to that point is
for naught.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After the work is completed,
the DM secretly checks for success. The base chance is 80%. This can
be increased or decreased by the materials used. For every level of
the spell, 1% is subtracted from the success chance, but every level
of the spellcaster adds 1%. Thus, a 15th-level mage (+15) making a
scroll of a 7th-level spell (-7), using papyrus (-5) and writing with
a cockatrice quill plucked with his own hand (+5) would have an (80 +
15 - 7 - 5 + 5 =) 88% chance of success.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the number rolled on
percentile dice is equal to or less than the required number, the
attempt succeeds. If the roll is higher, the attempt fails, though
the player has no way of knowing this.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the attempt fails, the
scroll is cursed in some way. The DM secretly decides an appropriate
effect based on the spell that was attempted. A failed attempt to
create a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>fireball</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
scroll may result in a cursed scroll that explodes in a fiery ball of
flame upon reading. The player character cannot detect the cursed
effect until it is too late.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Note: A </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>remove
curse</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell will
cause this faulty scroll to turn to dust.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A single scroll can contain 1
to 6 spells, the number determined randomly by the DM. The player can
never be certain of the amount of space required even for the same
spell on two different scrolls. A failed attempt to transcribe a
scroll automatically fills the remainder of the page, although other
spells successfully written before the failure remain. In this case,
the cursed effect of the failed spell will not come into effect until
that spell is read.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When using a scroll he
himself has prepared, a wizard does not need to resort to a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>read
magic</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell to
understand the writing.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Potions</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Potions are primarily the
province of wizards, although priests can prepare those potions
relating to healing and cures. (Priests of other mythos may or may
not be able to prepare such potions, depending on the spell spheres
available to them.) Healing and curing potions are beyond the ken of
wizards.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As with other magical items,
the character must identify and gather the materials needed to brew a
potion before he can begin work. The formula can be as
straightforward or bizarre as the DM desires. It may require the
blood of a rare creature, powdered gems, the sweat of a mare, or the
breath of a dying hero.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition, a potion
requires a number of mundane ingredients. The basic cost of these
ingredients ranges from 200 to 1,000 gp. The DM should decide this
based on how common the potion is, its power, and the nature of the
ingredients he has specified. A </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>potion
of dragon control</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
is a rare item of great power and so should cost the full 1,000 gp. A
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>potion of healing</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
is a fairly necessary item, something the DM may want to be readily
available to the characters. Therefore, it should be cheap, costing
no more than 200 gp.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Wizards</b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>
</b></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">must do more than
acquire ingredients: They also need a complete alchemical laboratory.
Potions are not something you can brew up over the kitchen stove!
This laboratory must be furnished with furnaces, alembics, retorts,
beakers, distilling coils, and smoldering braziers—in short, all
the trappings of a mad scientist's laboratory (circa 1400 AD).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The basic cost for such a
laboratory is at least 2,000 gp if all the skilled craftsmen are
readily available to construct the equipment to the wizard's
specifications. And this cost covers only the furnishings; the wizard
must also have an appropriate place to put all these things and to
conduct his work. Given the strange noises and foul smells that issue
at all hours from such a laboratory, many a landlord may be less than
willing to have his rooms used for such purposes.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once the laboratory is
established, the wizard must pay 10% of its value every month to
maintain the equipment, replacing things broken in experiments and
minor ingredients that lose potency with age.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Priests</b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
do not make use of a laboratory—such equipment smacks of impious
and heretical learning. Instead, the priest places his faith in
greater powers to perform the actual transformations needed to blend
the potion. As such, he uses an altar specially consecrated to the
purpose. When constructing such an altar, the character must be ready
to make some sacrifice of worth, either a monetary sacrifice or, even
more significantly, a special service to his deity. Thereafter, the
priest need only respect the altar as would be normal for his faith.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Creating
the Potion:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">With all this
equipment assembled, the wizard or priest is ready to begin. The cost
already determined, the time to brew, infuse, distill, decant, and
extract the potion is measured in days equal to the cost divided by
100. During this time, the character must remain uninterrupted except
for the normal needs of sleep and food. If the work is disturbed, the
potion is hopelessly ruined as are all ingredients used in it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After the work is done, the
DM secretly rolls percentile dice to determine if the potion has
taken. The base chance of success 70%. For every 100 gp worth of
ingredients, 1% is subtracted. For every two levels of the
spellcaster (or fraction thereof), 1% is added to the base.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the percentile roll is
equal to or less than the chance of success, the potion succeeds. If
the potion fails, the spellcaster has unwittingly brewed either a
deadly poison or a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>potion
of delusion,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> at the
DM's discretion. Of course, the player won't know whether a potion is
good until it's too late. In any case, the wizard or priest is wise
to label his creation, for there is no sure way to distinguish
between different potions by sight alone.</font></p>

<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Creating
Other Magical Items</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Potions and scrolls are not
the only magical items spellcasters can create. Other types of
magical item can be made—weapons, wands, staves, rods, rings,
bracers, braziers, cloaks, and more.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are also certain items
the player characters can't create. Artifacts, relics, books (except
spell books), and intelligent weapons are the realm of the DM only.
Such items can be found by the player characters, but never
manufactured by them. This ensures that the DM controls certain
elements that can appear only during the course of an adventure he
designs.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, certain magical
items have a particular racial connection, particularly the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>dwarven
warhammer +3, elven cloaks, boots of elvenkind, elven bows,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
and certain types of hammers and axes. These items can only be
fashioned by NPC dwarves and elves of particularly ancient age. The
making and awarding of these items is the task of the DM only.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, the DM has the right
to exclude from player manufacture any magical item he feels is too
powerful or too significant a part of his campaign world. (For
example, if all magical weapons in the DM's campaign are the product
of an ancient civilization and the art of their manufacture has now
been lost, he can deny the ability to create such items to the player
characters.)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	These limitations
notwithstanding, players should be invited to submit their own ideas
for new or unique items. The possibilities for new items are limited
only by the constraints of game balance. Perhaps the character wants
an arrow that explodes in a flash of brilliant light or a wand that
causes those touched to suffer amnesia.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Using the same give-and-take
process described for new player spells, the DM should have the
player write up a description of the desired item. The DM studies
this, alters it as needed, and discusses the changes with the player.
When both are in agreement, the character can begin the actual
process of research and construction.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a player announces the
desire to construct a given item, it is not the DM's task to tell him
whether this is within his capabilities or not. It is the DM's
responsibility to decide the materials and steps needed to construct
the item. The player can then have his character consult a sage,
fellow spellcaster, or higher power to learn what he needs. In the
process he may discover he lacks the appropriate powers to create the
item. This is one of the risks inherent in magical research.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Finding
the Right Materials:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">First the
character needs appropriate materials. When constructing a magical
item, no ordinary sword, stock, cloak, necklace, or whatever will do.
The item must be extraordinary in some way. Weapons must be of
high-quality craftsmanship. Woods must be rare, specially grown, or
cut in a particular way at a particular time. Cloth must be woven to
exacting specifications. The material itself may be of an impossible
nature (a shirt without seams or a hammer forged in a volcano's heart
and quenched in the deepest ocean).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Often, the only way to ensure
the appropriate vessel for the enchantment is for the spellcaster to
fashion or gather the item himself. However it is obtained, the
vessel should cost far more than a normal item of the same type. The
price can range from 1,000 to 10,00 (or more!) gold pieces depending
on the material.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Preparing
the Materials:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Once the vessel
for the magic is obtained, the character will have to prepare it. A
sword may need to be dipped in rare acids to burn away impurities.
Bone may need to be picked clean by giant ants. Wood could require
soaking in rare oils and herbs.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Though the item is, as yet,
far from gaining any sorcerous power, this stage is vital—failure
here means the spell will fail to take. Normally this stage takes
from two weeks to a month just to prepare the vessel. Additional
ingredients at this stage will cost at least 500 gold pieces, if not
more.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Enchanting
the Item:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The spellcaster
is now ready to begin the actual enchantment. Wizards must first
successfully cast an </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>enchant
an item</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> (or have
another do it for them) on the vessel according to the conditions
described for that spell. Once he is finished, the wizard can cast
other spells into the vessel, provide the last ingredients, or
perform the final steps in the enchantment process (as defined by the
DM).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The character might have to
take the enchanted item to the peak of the highest mountain to expose
it to the rays of the dawning sun before it will be ready. He could
have to immerse it in the distilled sorrows of nightingales. If
spells are necessary, these, instead of expending their energies, are
absorbed and transformed by the enchanted vessel.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The spell that must be cast
into the enchanted vessel is the one that matches the power desired.
If there is no direct spell equivalent, a more powerful spell with
essentially the same function can be cast instead. If there is no
spell equivalent at all, the wizard must research the appropriate
spell before he begins the process of making the magical item, or he
must provide exotic ingredients capable of conferring the power on
the item, whichever the DM decides.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thus, at this step, the
wizard could cast </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>lightning

make it a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>wand of

would have to research a new spell of create </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>gauntlets

no spell exists to improve Dexterity) or bathe the gauntlets in the
bottled essence of hummingbird dreams (as an example).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, if the item is to
hold its magic for more than a single use, a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>permanency</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell must be cast. This locks the trapped magic into the vessel,
empowering it at the command chosen by the wizard. If the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>permanency</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
is not used, the vessel only holds charges equal to the number of
spells cast upon it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If all these steps have been
performed correctly and without interruptions, the item will be
created...maybe. The process is long and involved and there are many
opportunities for unintended error. Thus, when all is said and done,
a success roll must be made. The basic chance of success is 60%. Each
level of the wizard adds 1% to the chance, while each spell, special
process, or unique ingredient used lowers the chance by 1%. The DM
can further adjust the percentage for any extra-special precautions
or notorious shortcuts the character might take.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the check is passed (by
rolling equal to or lower than the success chance) the desired item
has been created. If the check fails, the item is cursed, although
this may not be known until a much later time. The function of the
item becomes perverted, the opposite of the character's intention. A
cursed sword, for example, could lower the character's chances of
hitting, while cursed gauntlets could render the wearer clumsy.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A character can't seek to
make a cursed item with the hope and intention that the process will
fail (thereby gaining a useful magical item). The nature of magical
failure is such that the desired result, spoken or unspoken, never
occurs.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, suppose Thibault
the Younger, a mage of 17th level, seeks to make a powerful </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>sword
+5.</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> Using the
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>contact other plane</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell and money, he learns the steps he must perform and the items he
needs. His first task is to shape a sword blade with his own hands
from the ore of Mount Lothrian, at the very center of the Dwarven
Estates.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	He travels there, only to
discover that the Dwarven Lords consider this iron a treasure above
all others, not to be given out to aliens not of the blood. After
much careful bargaining, the Dwarven Lords agree to allow him to
undergo the Ordeal of the Pit, the rite of dwarven manhood. Thibault
is lowered into the caverns where even dwarves are loath to tread,
where, in a solo adventure, he barely escapes with his life. By the
time he has recovered and healed, the dwarves hail him as one of
their own and reward him with the ore he seeks. As an extra benefit,
during his time among the dwarves, Thibault learns a few more tricks
of bladesmithing, increasing his proficiency.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Now Thibault has the ore and,
on his journey home, stops by the Spring of Masters to get the second
item he needs—pure spring water. A short time later, he is safely
home. There, he spends a month hammering, folding, quenching, and
hammering again on the blade, spending 5,000 gp on the task.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally the work is done and
the blade is finished, the last step being to etch it in a bath of
black pudding acid. According to the instructions he received,
Thibault must next instill the blade with the power of purity. Just
what this means is not exactly clear, but his finances are running
low and he doesn't want to waste more time for investigation. He
decides to have the blade consecrated at a local temple and then has
a paladin lay hands upon it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All these steps completed,
Thibault begins his spellcasting. For days he works on casting the
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>enchant an item</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell. The spell succeeds. To make a +5 weapon he uses the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>enchanted
weapon</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell, one
for each plus. However, after four castings, the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>enchant
an item</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell fades
and Thibault must spend more time re-enchanting it. Once again
successful, he casts the last </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>enchanted
weapon</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> and then
seals everything with a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>permanency</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM secretly makes a check
for success. The chance is 60% (base) + 17% (Thibault's level) -12%
(for the ore, hand-forging, etching, instilling with purity,
enchanting twice, five pluses, and the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>permanency</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">)
= 65%. The DM rolls a 45. The work is successful and the sword is
finished. Needless to say, Thibault is not tremendously eager to do
this again right away.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

magical items appropriate to their calling. The process begins with
the selection of an appropriate vessel of the finest or most perfect
materials. Once the vessel is at hand, the priest must spend two
weeks in meditation and purification ceremonies and then another week
in fasting and purification. Then he must likewise purify the item
and seek to invoke it with a small portion of his deity's grandeur.
Fortunately, this step takes but a single day and night.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once this is done, the item
is ready for the final plea. As it rests upon an altar, the priest
must pray for the blessed sign that the deity will endow the vessel
with the desired powers. Each day there is a 1% cumulative chance
that the prayers will be heard.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once this step is completed,
the item need only be sanctified and consecrated, unless it is to
possess charges in which case the priest has 24 hours to cast the
appropriate spells into the item. Should the task to be incomplete at
the end of this time, the priest will once again have to seek his
deity's favor before continuing the process (in other words, start
over at the beginning).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The priest is assumed to be
perfectly faithful and true to his calling. Should this not be the
case, in the DM's estimation, the process may fail or yield some
result unanticipated by the priest. The enchantment may fail or the
character's deity may curse the item in retribution for the priest's
impudence in seeking favor so ill-deserved. The DM must judge the
standing of the priest based on his previous actions and his current
motives.</font></p>

Magical Items</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some items that carry several
charges are rechargeable. Recharging isn't easy, but it is easier
than creating an entirely new magical item. High-level wizards or
priests may find it useful to boost up an old item.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To recharge an item, it must
first be enchanted either through the use of an </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>enchant
an item</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell or
prayer, as noted above. Once prepared, new charges can be cast into
the item. One benefit of recharging an item is that each charge
requires only the spells' normal casting time (not the 2d4 hours per
spell level normally required by the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>enchant
an item</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, recharging is not
without risk to the item. Each time the item is enchanted to
recharge, it must roll a saving throw vs. spell (using the saving
throw of the caster) with a -1 penalty. If this saving throw is
failed, the character has accidentally interfered with the magic of
the item and it crumbles into useless dust.</font></p>

Magical Items</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Occasionally characters may
find it desirable, useful, or vitally necessary to bring about the
destruction of a magical item. Magical items are more resistant than
ordinary ones, but they are hardly indestructible, as Table 29 shows.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Characters who have
possession of a device and are determined to destroy it can do so at
will. They need only snap the blade of a magical sword or burn a lock
or whatever.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It is possible to target
specific magical items held by others, but it is very difficult. (In
fact, it is no easier or harder than attacking a non-magical item.)
Attempting to destroy an enemy's magical item may require attack
rolls, saving throws, and item saving throws.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The breaking of a magical
item should result in something more dramatic than the breaking of a
vase or a windowpane. As DM you are perfectly justified in describing
a dramatic explosion of force, a small whirlwind, a foul stench, or
whatever seems most appropriate to the moment.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For some items, particularly
some staves, there are specific rules that define the effects of the
item's destruction. Such cases are rare and the effects are
devastating, so they are recommended only for those in the area. You
might, for example, dictate that characters within 1 foot, 5 feet, or
even 10 feet suffer 1d8 points of damage.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This is just an example—the
actual damage can vary, at your discretion. Remember, however, that
such damage should only be used for effect; it should never kill or
seriously injure a character. After all, killing the character in the
explosion of his own magical sword is piling injury upon insult; the
loss of a prized magical treasure is bad enough!</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Vastly more potent than the

relics, the remains of awesome powers and the greatest of holy men.
These are items of great import and effect, so their use </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>must</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
be strictly controlled. The following absolute conditions are always
in effect when dealing with artifacts and relics.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The appearance of an artifact
or relic must always be the basis of an adventure. These items should
never be casually introduced into play.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Each artifact
and relic is unique. There can only be one of that item in existence
in a given campaign. It appears in a campaign only when it has been
placed there by the DM. These devices never form part of a randomly
placed treasure and so are not on any treasure table. The DM must
choose to include each particular artifact in his game.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Artifacts and relics always
possess dangerous and possibly deadly side effects. These effects are
all but irreversible, unaffected by wishes and most greater powers.
Artifacts can only be destroyed by extraordinary means.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Artifacts and relics can
never be transferred from one campaign to another. If player
characters from another DM's campaign enter yours, they automatically
do so without any artifacts they might possess.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So, given all these warnings
and admonitions, just what is it that makes artifacts and relics so
potentially dangerous to use in a role-playing game?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the top of the list is the
fact that, in game terms, artifacts and relics are nothing more than
excuses for the DM to break any and every rule he cares to. Upon
learning the proper command, an artifact or relic might allow a
character to raise all his ability scores immediately to their
maximum or turn an enemy's bones to jelly.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The artifact might allow the
character to summon meteor swarms, utter a power word, resurrect, or
stop time once per day at will. He might be able to summon powerful
monsters and easily bend them to his will. He could discover the
power to dominate the minds of others, enslaving them to his desires.
And this might only be a small part of what the artifact would allow
him to do. In short, there is no limit to what you, as the DM, decide
an artifact can accomplish.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">All of these
items have been handed down from ancient times and have histories
shrouded in myth and legend. An artifact has the same background and
aura about it as, for example, King Arthur's Excalibur, the skin of
the Nemean lion worn by Hercules, Pandora's box, the Golden Fleece,
the sword, jewels, and mirror of ancient Japan, or the hammer of
Thor.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	These unique objects were
once held and used by gods and mortals far greater and more powerful
than normal men. Often these items existed for an express purpose—to
be used by a particular hero, to fight a particular foe. So closely
associated is an artifact with a person, time, or place that its
powers can seldom be fully used except by specific individuals who
meet certain standards. A weakling could not hurl Thor's hammer, nor
could just anyone command Baba Yaga's hut. An artifact may show its
full powers only to deal with particular, very specific, threats or
dangers. Artifacts have purposes, sometimes fulfilled long in the
past and sometimes never-ending.</font></p>

Artifacts and Relics into a Campaign:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Because the
impact of an artifact is so great, you should use them only in the
most earth-shaking adventures you can devise. You must always have a
reason for bringing an artifact into your game. It should never
appear just because you want to give the characters something bigger
and better.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If discovered at the
beginning of an adventure, it should be the prelude to some great
threat to the kingdom, empire, continent, or world where the item
will make a difference. Rather than simply giving the item to the
characters, you can introduce the danger first and then set the
player characters searching for the artifact that will defeat or stem
the tide of evil that threatens to oversweep the land. Alternatively,
the player characters could be faced with the worst of all
situations—one in which the artifact is in the hands of the enemy
and the players must get it away from them. Each of these creates an
adventure or, more likely, a series of adventures centered around the
device.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once the adventure is over,
it is best for you to find some way to get the artifact out of the
players' hands. In essence, the artifact was a MacGuffin—the thing
that made the plot go—not something you want to remain in your
campaign now that the need for the item is gone. This is very much in
keeping with the nature of artifacts and relics, since they have a
maddening habit of disappearing once their task is done. To leave the
artifact in the campaign is to invite abuse by the player characters,
perhaps for noble ends, but abuse all the same. There are, even in a
fantasy game, &quot;some things man was not meant to know.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Because of their grand impact
and titanic significance in the scheme of things, artifacts should be
used sparingly. There are only so many times the characters can save
the world before it becomes old hat.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Don't be too eager to
introduce these items into play and don't bring them in too often.
Artifacts and relics represent the epitome of magical items. They are
going to lose a lot of effect if every king in every kingdom has one
in his treasure chambers. If characters only find one artifact in
their entire careers, it will be enough. Well-played for all its
drama, it will lead to an adventure the players will remember for a
long time to come.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When you do decide to
introduce an artifact or relic, you design it specially for your

artifacts should always be made to fit your campaign, not the other
way around. In this way, the players will never know what to
expect—not its shape, its history, its powers, or its purpose. All
these things will make the discovery and use of the item more
exciting. In addition, you will have the knowledge that you have
created something major, perhaps the most significant thing, for your
campaign. That is no small accomplishment.</font></p>

the beneficial or useful powers of the artifact, create the dangers
inherent in its use. All artifacts have grave risks—such is the
nature of their power. The item was originally used by someone of
great will and power, and even they placed themselves in danger to

danger is nearly inescapable. These dangers are usually drastic
physical side effects that affect the character. Again you want the

Effect:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">As if this
weren't enough, all artifacts have a corrupting effect. Characters
become suspicious of others and possessive of the item. They begin to
see threats where none were intended. Ultimately they will turn upon
their friends and companions, seeing them as scheming enemies out to
destroy them and steal the artifact.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As with the drawbacks, this
effect is caused by the fact that the player character is not the one
the artifact was first intended for. His personality is different,
and no matter how great he is, he lacks the force of will of the
great hero, arch-wizard, high priest, or demigod, who originally
wielded the item.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Finally, prepare
some method by which the artifact can be destroyed. Destroying an
artifact is never easy—in fact, it's nearly impossible. Artifacts
and relics are impervious to all normal harm and magical attacks.
They cannot be crushed, dissolved in acid, melted or broken normally.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At best, the physical form
can be disrupted for a period of time, but within a century or less
it will re-form in some new location. To truly destroy an artifact,
the characters must fulfill some exacting set of conditions as unique
as the artifact itself. Possible ways to destroy an artifact include:</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>The
Hand of Vecna:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Seldom is the
name Vecna spoken, and even then only in the most hushed and
terrified tones, for legends say the shade of this most supreme of
all liches still roams the world.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Little is known of this being
except that he eventually met his doom in some awesome
conflagration—or at least that his physical body was destroyed.
Still rumors persist that one hand (and perhaps an eye) survived even
this destruction.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	These rumors ascribe strange
and powerful abilities to the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Hand
of Vecna</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">, still
imbued with the unquenchable spirit of Vecna. The Hand is variously
described as large and small, but all accounts agree that it is
extremely withered and blackened, as if from a burned body.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The first recorded appearance
of the Hand was during the Insurrection of the Yaheetes, 136 years
after the passing of Vecna. With the overthrow of Paddin the Vain,
leader of the clan, the Hand apparently disappeared.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	During the reign of Hamoch of
Tyrus, the hand was discovered by the fisherman Gisel. For several
decades he kept it as a curiosity, until he was slain by his brother
who stole the artifact. The brother was waylaid en route to Tyrus and
the Hand fell into the possession of the outlaw Mace.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	With a single gesture of the
Hand, Mace is said to have struck down the gates of Tyrus and brought
plague onto the royal house. Stories are told how he spent one night
in the royal bedchamber where he was visited by the spirit of Vecna.
Undoubtedly he changed, for the next day he ordered the execution of
his former followers to appease the wrathful shade.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In the 100 years of Mace's
reign, the city of Tyrus grew in power, but it became ill-famed as
the Slaughterhouse of the Western Shore. Mace (now styled Vecna the
Second) was struck down by a Yemishite assassin when the power of the
Hand inexplicably failed him.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Since that time the Hand has
appeared briefly in a number of widely scattered lands. Most of these
appearances are unsubstantiated, but the corruption of the
Paladin-King of Miro is a well-documented case. Foolishly fixing the
Hand onto his own arm, the Paladin-King discovered too late that he
could not remove it and in the end it destroyed him.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For the Hand to function, it
must be touched to the stump of an arm, to which it grafts instantly.
The grip is immensely strong (19 Strength, no attack roll or damage
bonuses however).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At first, the Hand seems
useful and harmless enough, but within it resides some portion of
Vecna's evil spirit. Gradually the owner comes to believe he is
Vecna. Good characters becoming cruel and malevolent; evil characters
become the embodiment of corruption, eventually turning on their
friends and allies.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Suggested powers for the Hand
include: </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>death ray</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
(no saving throw, once a day), </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>cause

100-foot area/2 times per day), </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>animate

1/day), and </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>time
stop</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> (1/week).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Aside from the fact that the
Hand is corruptive, its other major drawbacks include the fact that
it cannot be removed short of chopping off the arm and the fact that
those who see the Hand will covet it, attempting to take it from its
current owner. Finally, the Hand foresees the moment of its owner's
doom and its powers will fail just at that given time.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>The
Rod of Seven Parts:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It is said that
the Wind Dukes of Aaqa were the creators of this legendary artifact.
Manifesting themselves upon the world at the battle of Pesh, where
the powers of Chaos and Law arrayed themselves, the Dukes presented
the Rod to the Captains of Law. In the battle, the Rod was supposedly
sundered in the slaying of Miska, the Wolf-Spider, consort of the
Queen of Chaos.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The Dukes, to prevent the
Rod's capture, snatched up the seven parts and scattered them
throughout the world. Ever since, agents of the Queen have sought out
the Rod. It is rumored that if she regains all the parts, she can
return Miska to the realms of men.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The original rod was said to
be about 5 feet long, but the pieces are irregular in length. The
parts go together in a specific order, the first being narrowest and
each later piece increasing in diameter. Assembling the Rod is
difficult, however, because the item is still protected by the Wind
Dukes. Each section conveys a sense of the direction to the next
piece. Pieces assembled to each other in the correct order will bond
together; however, if any piece is placed out of sequence, it will
instantly disappear, to appear randomly somewhere else in the world.
Upon assembling the first three pieces, the owner will refuse to part
with the item at any time, even when sleeping, eating, bathing, or
engaging in other personal activities.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Because it was once
shattered, the Rod is fragile. There is a 5% chance that it will
break apart (and be scattered by the Wind Dukes) each time its major
power is used.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Each piece of the Rod has a
minor power. Suggested powers are: </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>immunity</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
to one attack form, </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>fly
at will, cure light wounds</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
(1/day), </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>true seeing</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
(1/day), </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>hold
monster</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> (1/day),
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>double character's
movement, slow</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
(1/day). When completely assembled, the Rod can have major powers.
Suggested powers are: </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>restoration</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
(1/day) and </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>shape
change</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> (2/day).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Created to the service of
order, the Rod changes its user to an absolute follower of law, even
more so than the most rigid lawful good. The character will feel
compelled to intervene in all things to maintain the primacy of law
over chaos, heedless of the effects for good or ill. Those not
adhering to the Rod-holder's strict views are perceived as enemies.
Once all the parts are assembled, the Rod also radiates an aura of
fearsome, icy law affecting all within a 20-foot radius. When its
major powers are used, those who fail to save must flee in panic.</font></p>

music, the Patron was able to spread the gifts of harmony, composing,
grace, and beauty. Through his songs, Heward watched over and
protected the lands, guiding the weather to glorious sunsets, rain to
fall on parched soil, bread to rise firm and fresh, children to be
happy, and indeed protecting all that mankind now loves.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Unfortunately, the Fables
say, mice among the frets gnawed at the workings, causing sour notes
to escape, giving voice to the harpies, sirens, and other evil
creatures that entice and trap by song. Enraged, the Patron cursed
the mice to remain forever lowly and meek of voice. Believing the
Organ ruined, the Patron abandoned it (and took up the harp).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The location of the Mystical
Organ is unknown, but the legends of several great and powerful bards
relate its discovery and subsequent loss. Oldenburg the Blind
supposedly discovered it and from its keys learned the 9 Enchanting
Lays whereby he won the heart of Princess Leir, daughter of the evil
Fairie-Lord Marrad. Mad Ossam was supposedly stricken upon trying to
compose a tune at the Organ. Cursed with the power of blight and
despair, he brought baronies to their knees in his travels. Many a
bard has claimed to have studied at the Organ, but these are
certainly nothing more than the exaggerations of showmen.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The Organ is a massive,
immovable object. The pipes easily extended the height of a cathedral
chapel. The keyboard has three different sets, and there are 27 ivory
stops. Nine great pedals control the bass notes. Each pipe is sounded
by a bound elemental of appropriate size. The stops, when arranged in
different settings, alter the pitch and voice of each pipe, while the
keys strike the notes. Age, disuse (for even an artifact of such
delicacy must be tended), and the ravages of the spiteful mice have
rendered many of the pipes, keys, and stops inoperable.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To use the Organ one must
play a tune upon it. However, this is a tremendously dangerous
business since there are so many possible combinations of settings
and notes. Prior research and faith in the gods must serve as a
guide. (As an option, players can compose or at least hum a little
ditty of their own when their characters attempt to use the organ.)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a tune is played, the
magic takes effect. Just what magical result occurs is left to the
DM. He should base this upon the quality of the playing, the
tastefulness and mastery of the music, and the desires of the player.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Theoretically, Heward's
Mystical Organ can have as many powers as there are settings and
tunes to be played. With such a broad range, the DM can create
virtually any result. The press of a key may cause flowers or straw
to rain over a small village 100 miles away, while a fugue may result
in the sinking of several islands off the coast or the reshaping of
the organist into a newt (especially if he hits a bad note).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Unlike other artifacts (which
possess powers the character must discover), users of the Organ
should decide upon the effect they wish to create and then research
the notes and stops needed to create it. The DM can, of course, alter
the end result (mortals playing with the toys of gods seldom get what
they really want) and a check should be made to see if any errors (a
missed note or beat) occur in the playing.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If an error is made, the DM
can have drawbacks and unfortunate results prepared. Some of these
can include: permanently </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>polymorphing</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
the player into a small lizard or insect, permanent deafness or
madness, or immediate alignment change. The character could be
endowed with a voice equal to a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>horn
of blasting</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> (so he
can't speak without causing harm), or he might be forever compelled
to speak in rhyme or in song. One or more levels might be drained by
the Organ. All magical items within 100 feet could be permanently
negated. The organist could be teleported to another planet, etc.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition, the tones of the
Organ, no matter how badly set or played, are of unearthly beauty.
Whenever it is played, all hearing it (including the organist) must
roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or be enchanted forever.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Those so stricken cannot
abide any other sound. Deprived of its tones, they despair and see no
wonder or greatness (in either good or evil) in the world. Gradually,
those enchanted take less and less interest in life until they
finally reach the point where even the finest food is an anathema to
them. These slowly wasting creatures are truly piteous sights.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The location of the Organ is
constantly changing. All the legends agree that it exists nowhere in
the world, but in some misty other realm. Noteworthy too is the fact
that those who leave its hall are never able to find it again.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If the imagination of players
and DMs are fuel of the AD&amp;D game, encounters are the engine that
makes it go. Without encounters, nothing happens. Without encounters,
player can't slay fearsome trolls, rescue the villagers from a band
of orcs, chase down a petty thief, outwit an evil wizard, or humble a
mighty tyrant. Encounters make up the plot of the adventure, each in
some way furthering the tale or building the background of your
campaign world. Without encounters, without the opportunity to meet
and deal with others, your campaign world is just going nowhere.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To use encounters, it is
important to understand what they are. An encounter is a meeting with
an NPC or monster, or an event that might affect the player
characters. As DM, you:</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	These are a big part of the
DM's duties in a role-playing game (in addition to the task of
interpreting the rules and handling the mechanics of play).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">What is
an Encounter?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	An encounter is best defined
by two broad criteria. If the described event lacks either of these,
it isn't a true encounter. It may be a described scene, an event, or
a bit of mundane business, but it is not a role-playing encounter.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	First, an encounter must
involve a thing, an event, NPCs (characters or monsters), or a
DM-controlled player character. A meeting of two player characters
(handled by the player alone) is not an encounter. It is an action
between the players themselves.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Second, an encounter must
present the possibility of a meaningful change in a player
character's abilities, possessions, or knowledge, depending upon the
player's decisions. The keys here are meaningful change and player
decision. For each character with 500 gp in his pocket, going into a
tavern and spending three gp on drinks is not meaningful change. If
the character had to spend the same 500 gp in the same tavern to get
information about the Black Tower across the river, the character has
experienced a meaningful change-he's now broke.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the player doesn't make a
decision, then he's just coasting along, letting the DM do
everything. Going to the tavern and spending three gold pieces on
food and drink isn't much of a decision. Choosing to go bankrupt to
learn what may or may not be useful information is fairly
significant. The player is going to have to think about the choice.
How badly does he want this information? How reliable is this
informant? Does he need the money for something else-like new
equipment? Can he get a better price?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The presence of an active
force and the possibility for change based on player decision are
what make a true role-playing encounter. Take, for example, the
situations given below. Try to figure out which of the four is a true
encounter, as defined above.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	1. Rupert and Algorond, a
gnome, are exploring a cave. Algorond is in the lead. Without any
warning the ceiling directly over him collapses, crushing the little
gnome instantly. He is dead, and all Rupert can do is dig out the
body.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	2. Rupert, a 10th-level
fighter, meets three lowly orcs. They charge and, not surprisingly
Rupert slices them to ribbons. He isn't even harmed. Searching the
chamber, he finds a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>sword
+1</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">. Rupert already
has a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>sword +3</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
and is not particularly interested in this weapon.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	3. Rupert reaches into his
pocket only to discover that the gem he pried from a heathen idol is
gone! Thinking about it, he decides the only person who could have
taken it was his fellow party member (and player character) Rangnar
the Thief. Unhesitatingly, he whips out his sword and holds it at
Rangnar's throat. Rangnar reaches for his hidden dagger.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	4. Rupert and Taras
Bloodheart are riding across the plain. Just as they crest a low
ridge, they see a cloud of smoke and dust in the distance. They halt
and watch for a little while. The dust cloud slowly moves on their
direction, while the smoke dwindles. Moving their horses to a hollow,
the watch the approach of the mysterious cloud from a thicket.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	So, which of these four is a
true encounter? Only the last one. The first didn't involve any
player choice. The gnome is crushed, and there wasn't anything either
player character could do about it. Not only is this not an
encounter, it isn't fair. It could have been an encounter (with a
trapped ceiling), if there had been signs beforehand (clattering
stones, previous deadfalls, groaning stones) and if the gnome had
been given the opportunity to act before the rock squashed him. The
player choice could have been to heed or ignore the warnings and leap
forward, back, or stand confused when the rock fell.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The second had player choice,
but it wasn't particularly meaningful or balanced. The player knew
his character could win the combat so his choice to fight was
insignificant. He knew the sword was less potent than the one he
already had, so his choice not to keep it was, likewise, not a choice
at all. The situation could have been an encounter if the orcs had
actually been ogres concealed by an illusion or if the sword had
special unrevealed powers. Either of these would have made the
character's actions meaningful.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The third situation has all
the trappings of an encounter. There is meaningful choice and
anything could happen next. However, this is a squabble between
player characters, not something the DM has control over. It does not
further the plot or develop campaign background. Indeed, such
disharmony will only hurt the game in the long run. It could have
become an encounter if an invisible NPC thief had done the deed
instead of Ragnar. Rupert and Ragnar, eventually realizing the
confusion, would have suddenly found themselves united in a new
purpose—to find the culprit. Of course, there would also be
role-playing opportunity as Rupert tried to make amends while Ragnar
remembered the insult!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The fourth example is a true
encounter, even though it doesn't seem like much is happening. The
players have made significant decisions, particularly to stay and
investigate, and they are faced by an unknown creature. They do not
know what they face and they do not know if it will be for good or
ill. The dust cloud could be a djinni or a hostile air elemental. It
could be a war-band of 100 orcs or giant lizards. The players don't
know but have decided to take the risk of finding out.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In role-playing games,
encounters fall into one of two general categories—planned (or
placed) encounters and random (or wandering) encounters. Each
contributes to the overall excitement and adventure of the game.</font></p>

Encounters</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A planned encounter is one of
the DM has prepared in advance, one tied to a specific place, event,
or condition. These can be divided into keys and triggers.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Keys</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The simplest of planned
encounters is called a key—a listing of who lives where, what they
have, and what they might do if a character enters their room, visits
their farm, or explores their cave. This key can also contain
colorful details about otherwise boring or empty rooms, creating
detail for the player characters to explore. Here's how a sample key
for an ogre's den, a three-chambered cave, might be written.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">1. </font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Main
Chamber:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">One passage of
this chamber leads to the outside, a narrow cleft in the rock hidden
behind some bushes. Following this, the passage widens after 10 feet.
The walls are coated with soot and there is a large pit in the center
of the floor filled with ashes and charred bits of bone. The ashes
are warm and the rocks of the pit are still hot to the touch. The
chamber stinks of burned meat and leather. There is a lot of rubbish
on the floor but there is nothing of value here. At the far end, the
cleft once again narrows to a passage.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">2.
</font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Sleeping
Chamber:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Here the air is
thick with smells of animal sweat and worse. There is a loud rumbling
from the far side of the chamber. There, sleeping under a mound of
crudely skinned furs, is a large ogre. Next to him is a large wooden
club. Hanging from the walls are bits of bright cloth, shiny buckles,
and tarnished badges. A few simple torches, now unlit, are wedged in
the cracks.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the characters don't move
slowly in this room, one will kick a metal helmet across the floor,
waking the ogre. Groggy for one round, he then attacks the group.
Just beyond the nest is another passage.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">3.
</font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Treasure
Room:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The entrance to
this chamber is blocked by a large boulder that must be rolled into
the room to get it out of the way. Characters must get it out of the
way. Characters must roll a successful bend bar/lift gates check to
move it. (Several characters can work together, totaling their
chances into a single roll.) Inside the room are the treasures of the
ogre. These include 500 gp, 3 gems (worth 10, 500, and 100 gp), a
suit of </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>chain mail
+1</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> the beast cannot
use, and a mound of horse trappings, bridles, and saddles. Aside from
the bats, there are no creatures in the chamber.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When you write a key,
describe the way the scene looks as accurately as possible. Also
think what sounds the player characters might hear, what they'd
smell, what the place feels like, and so on. Writing a good key is
like writing a good story. At the very least, include the following
information for every location:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	    </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>•
</b></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Any monsters or
NPCs found there.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	    </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>•
</b></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">What equipment and
magical items the monsters will use.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	    </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>•
</b></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Any treasure (and
its location).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	    </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>•
</b></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Any other unusual
items of interest. This can include colorful details to help you
describe the area or clues to warn characters of danger ahead.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The key can also include
special conditions that must be met while in the area. In the example
above, there were penalties for not being alert and cautious (kicking
the helmet) and requirements for Strength (moving the boulder).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, keys are
static—things don't change that much. No matter whether the
characters enter at noon or midnight, the ogre will be sleeping. He
won't be cooking his dinner, out hunting, or picking his teeth with
his toes.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For fairly simple scenes this
is fine, but the situation gets ridiculous for more complicated
situations. Imagine a farm where the farmer was always in the field
or a castle where dinner was continually being served!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Static also means that events
in one place don't affect things in another. If the characters heave
the boulder out of the way, won't the noise awaken the ogre? Not
according to the description as it is given, although a good DM would
certainly consider the possibility. Writing a key that takes all
these potential inconsistencies into account isn't easy. To be
complete, you would have to design the key in your head, figuring out
all the interconnections, before you wrote anything down.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are two solutions to
this problem: You can try to be complete and thorough, preparing
answers for every possible situation, or you can reduce the amount of
detail you give about creature behaviors and improvise answers as you
play. To describe a farmhouse, you could simply note the occupants
(their ages and the like) and the significant possessions at the
farm. The activity of the NPCs can be adjusted to the moment—working
in fields, sleeping, eating, etc.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Trying to pre-plan for every
eventuality is time-consuming—there is a fair amount of planning
and writing you must do. Improvising cuts down on preparation, but
forces you to work harder during the game. The best solution is to
compromise: Carefully detail the most important planned encounters
and simply sketch out and improvise the small encounters. This way
you are not overwhelmed in preparation or play.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Triggers</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Another type of planned
encounter is the trigger. It can be used with a key or by itself. A
trigger is a simple either/or or if/then type of statement. It is
used for more interactive types of encounters, where the action of
the event is what is important, such as the kidnapping described
below.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The next episode occurs at 1
o'clock in the morning: If any character is still awake, he hears a
muffled scream coming from the balcony of the room next door. If the
characters investigate, they will discover two hooded men (6th-level
thieves) attempting to drag a struggling young woman over the
railing. One man has her firmly gripped from behind, his hand clamped
over her mouth. The other is hoisting her legs over the side. A
confederate waits with the horses on the ground below. If the
characters do nothing, there will be a crash as she kicks over a
flower urn, followed by a muttered curse and then the galloping of
horses.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the characters are
noticed, the unburdened man wheels to face them, drawing two swords,
one in each hand. The woman attempts to break free, only to be struck
unconscious by the other man. The man on the ground quietly cocks a
crossbow and aims it at the party, keeping an eye out for
spellcasters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Here everything is dependent
upon previous and current choices of action. Is a character awake?
Will the characters investigate? How will they react to the
kidnappers? Each decision molds subsequent events. The characters
might leap to the young woman's rescue or they might rouse themselves
only in time to see the kidnappers gallop off with her tied to the
saddle. Their actions could alter planned events. Coming to her aid,
the characters rescue the lady. As DM you must be ready to tell her
story. Why was she attacked? Who were they? Are there any clues the
characters can find?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To write this type of
encounter, first outline the basic sequence of events that would
happen if the characters did not interfere. Next, think like a player
and try to anticipate what the characters might do. Would they aid
the lady? If so, you will need combat information—how the attackers
will fight and what weapons and tactics they will use. What happens
if the characters try to sound the alarm or talk to the kidnappers?
What will the lady say if rescued? At least a brief note should be
made to account for the probable reactions of the player characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As complete as you make them,
triggers are not without their weaknesses. While very good at
describing a scene, a trigger does not provide much background
information. In the event above, there is no description of the room,
the attackers, the lady's history, etc. There could be, but including
it would be extra work, and description would also get in the way of
the action.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A less critical problem is
that DMs can't anticipate every action of the player characters. No
matter how carefully a trigger is constructed, there is always
something the characters can do to upset the situation. In the
example above, what if the characters panic and a mage launches a
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>fireball</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
at the attackers? In a flash of flame, they and their victim are
killed and the building is on fire. Prescient is the DM who can
anticipate this event!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There is no simple solution
for unpredictable players (nor would you want one!). As a DM you are
never going to be able to predict every player decision. Experience,
both as a player and a DM, teaches you what the most likely actions
are. Beyond these you must improvise, relying on your skill as a DM.</font></p>

Keys and Triggers</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Many DMs make use of a dual
arrangement for preparing encounters. First they prepare a key,
describing the appearance of the encounter locations, items in them,
and other things that are relatively non-changing. Then they write
triggers focusing on the characters and the actions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When they need to describe a
room, they rely on the key, while the trigger describes the plot of
the adventure. Although this requires a little more set-up, this
allows different events to happen in the same place or area, giving a
feeling of continuity to the adventure and campaign.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition to planned
encounters, the DM also runs random encounters. These aren't tied to
a specific place or event. They are based on chance.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	During the course of an
adventure, the DM makes encounter checks, rolling a die to determine
if a random encounter occurs. If one does, the DM chooses or randomly
rolls for an encounter using a random encounter table he has prepared
or one provided with a published adventure. Complete random encounter
tables are provided in the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Monstrous
Compendium.</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> These
can be updated and replaced as new creatures are added to the 2nd
Edition AD&amp;D game.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a check indicates an
encounter is imminent, a creature or NPC determined by the encounter
tables will arrive in the area in the next few minutes to
investigate. Many encounters end in combat, but this isn't
necessary—it is possible to talk to intelligent creatures, whether
in the dungeon, out in the wilderness, or on the streets of a town or
city.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some argue that random
encounters are foolish and should not be used. These people maintain
that everything should be under the control of the DM, that there
should be no surprises for him while playing the game.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Certainly, random encounters
can be abused through overuse, and they can create illogical
encounters. (The word foolish would certainly apply to the DM who
allowed the characters to be attacked by an orc war-band in the
middle of a peaceful human city!) However, when used judiciously,
random encounters add to everyone's fun in a couple of ways.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Random
encounters introduce variety the player characters didn't expect. The
characters, exploring a dungeon, become overconfident if they only
encounter monsters in chambers and rooms. Random encounters reminds
them that any second could be dangerous, no matter where they are.</font></p>

encounters make the game more exciting for the DM. The game has to be
fun and challenging for him as well as the players. Part of the
challenge for the DM is to improvise an encounter on the spot. The DM
gets involved and excited, improving the play of the game.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To use a random encounter,
the DM doesn't just open his rulebook and blindly pick a monster
(although there is nothing that says he can't do this). Instead, he
uses or creates specific tables that are tailored to the needs of the
adventure and adventuring area, by including only those monsters or
NPCs that are appropriate to the setting.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Characteristics
of Random Encounter Tables</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All encounter tables share
certain concepts. Before you begin creating your own tables, some
understanding of these basics is necessary.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Uniqueness:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Although one
could create a single encounter table and use it for every situation,
this is a grievous limitation on the wealth and detail possible in a
campaign world. Encounter tables add distinction and differentiation
to areas. Encounter tables can reflect conditions as basic as terrain
or as complicated as entire social structures.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This in mind, the DM should
decide where in the campaign world each encounter table applies. A
single table could be made for all deserts; a separate table could be
made for the Desert of Shaar, which is noted for its fabulous beasts;
a further table could be made for the ten-mile area around the Palace
of Yasath in the Desert of Shaar, where the Emir of Yasath maintains
patrols to keep the beasts at bay. Within the palace an entirely
different encounter table would be needed, since the patrols don't
tramp through the hallways and harems.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Each table says something
about the conditions in a particular area—the level of
civilization, the degree of danger, even the magical weirdness of the
area. Although the players never see the entire table, such tables
help the DM define for himself the nature of his campaign world.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Frequency:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">All monsters
have a frequency of appearance, whether given in the monster's
description or assumed by the DM. Orcs are more common than
minotaurs, which are seen more often than dragons, which, in turn,
are seen more often than Tiamat, Evil Queen of the Dragons. Frequency
of appearance is normally listed as common, uncommon, rare, very
rare, and unique.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Common</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
creatures normally account for 70% of the local population. They may
be more prolific or just more outgoing, more likely to show
themselves to strangers.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Uncommon</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
monsters fill the next 20%. They are fewer in number and tend to be
more wary of outsiders.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Rare</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
creatures account for another 7%. Such creatures are normally
solitary, exceptionally powerful, or very retiring.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Very
rare</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> creatures
constitute only 3% of the population. They are truly exotic and
almost always extremely powerful. They may be creatures who have
wandered far from their normal range or whose magical nature is such
that not many can possibly exist at any one time in any one place.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Unique</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
monsters are just that. They are individuals, specific and named.
Such creatures should never be used on random encounter tables. They
are reserved for planned encounters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The chance of encounter is
not determined solely by the frequency listing, however. The DM
should also take into account a location's terrain or deadliness. A
polar bear can be considered unique only in the tropics and is very
rare at best even in the northernmost reaches of temperate lands. An
orc living in the deadliest area of an ancient ruin, an area
populated by a dragon, mind flayers, and medusae, would be very rare
indeed (and very lucky to be alive). Frequency must be modified to
suit conditions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Frequency must also be
subservient to the conditions the DM desires to create. If the DM
wants a valley filled with magical creatures of incredible
deadliness, then rare and very rare creatures are going to be more
frequent. A lost valley filled with dinosaurs defies the normal
chances of encountering such beasts. Indeed, they could only be
considered unique elsewhere.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, frequency does
not mean characters will encounter a creature 70% or 20% of the time,
only that it falls into a group that composes that percentage of the
population. The percentages and ratings given are not demographic
data; they are only guidelines.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Several common creatures will
compose the bulk of the population, so that the chance of meeting any
particular type is less than 70%. The same is true for all the other
categories. In the end, the chance of meeting a particular type of
common creature is still greater than that of meeting an uncommon or
very rare creature.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Logic:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The other
significant factor restricting encounter tables is rationality.
Everything on the encounter table should be justifiable for one
reason or another. By requiring justification, the DM can quickly
narrow his range of creature choices down to a reasonable number, in
essence winnowing the chaff from the wheat.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The first and easiest
criteria are terrain and temperature. Camels aren't found in jungles:
kraken don't crawl across deserts. Glaring contradictions of logic
must be justified. Produce a woodland dryad in the middle of a barren
waste and the players are going to demand some explanation. Worse
yet, they may assume the encounter is significant to the adventure
because it is so illogical, which may in turn throw your entire
adventure off track.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even if the creature fits a
given terrain, it may not be appropriate to the setting. Just because
an orc can appear on the plains doesn't mean it should, not if those
plains are at the heart of a fiercely guarded human empire. Out on
the fringes where raiding bands could slip across the border would be
a far more appropriate place.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As important as terrain and
temperature in assessing the logic of a random encounter is the
character of the society the table is supposed to reflect. Balance
what the players expect to meet with what would make a good
adventure. At the heart of an empire, the characters would expect to
find farmers, merchants, nobles, priests, and the like. The task for
the DM is to find ways to make these seemingly ordinary encounters
interesting.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In wilderness areas and
abandoned ruins, there may not be a particular culture to consider.
However, there is a society of sorts or, more accurately, an
ecosystem. This is often overlooked in dungeon settings. Just which
creatures feed on which? What relationships exist that allow all
manner of diverse creatures to live in the same place without
annihilating each other? Does a creature's random appearance make
sense with what the characters know about the place? Medusae make
poor wandering monsters, since logic says there should be statues of
their victims in areas where they live. To round a corner and run
into a medusa who just happens to be strolling the caverns grates
against logic.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Effect:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Finally, as DM,
consider the role of the random encounter. Such an encounter is not a
part of the adventure being told; it hasn't been worked into the plot
and doesn't advance the conflicts. A random encounter should not be
the most exciting event of an adventure. You don't want the players
remembering only the random encounter and forgetting the story you
worked to create!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Random encounters provide
breaks in the action and can build or release tension. The characters
are galloping after the desperately fleeing kidnappers. Suddenly a
flight of griffins, attracted by the clamor of the chase, swoop down,
aiming to make a meal of the player characters' horses. The
kidnappers may escape unless the characters can extricate themselves
from the attack in mere moments! The tension level goes up.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Random encounters can also
wear the player characters down in preparation for a larger, planned
encounter. The uncertainty of the encounters adds an element of risk
for the players. Will the characters be strong enough? A random
encounter should rarely cripple a party (unless they are in a sorry
state to begin with), but each one should weaken them a little.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It doesn't matter if the
player characters win every random encounter, especially not if they
are down a few more hit points, spells, and magical items after each.
Just knowing they are not at peak form and that they have expended
their abilities on wandering monsters makes the players nervous.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For these reasons, you don't
want to use the most powerful and significant creatures when creating
random encounter tables. You certainly don't want to use creatures
that are more powerful than those in the rest of your adventure!
Random monsters should be less significant than those you have
planned.</font></p>

Encounter Tables</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are a multitude of ways
a DM can create encounter tables (as many ways as there are different
ranges of die rolls). The choices range from very simple (roll 1d6
for one of six possible choices) to very complicated (roll percentile
dice, modify for time of day and weather and cross-index the result
with the terrain). With this, and the common characteristics
described above, in mind, you can create random encounter tables for
virtually any situation.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As already noted, an
encounter table can be constructed around virtually any type of die
or dice roll. Two of the best, however, are the 2-20 table and the
percentile table. Both provide a wide enough range of results to
account for the varying frequency of appearance of the monsters the
DM wants to use.</font></p>

<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">The 2-20
Table</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This table has nineteen
openings (although, by doubling up on some entries, more or less than
nineteen different encounters can appear on the table). The 2-20
number is generated by adding the roll of 1d8 to that of 1d12. Thus,
2s and 20s are very rare, while there is an equal chance for results
from 9 through 13. Monsters are assigned specific positions on the
table according to their frequency, as shown on Table 54.</font></p>

presence of the djinni on the table by deciding that it will be
helpful to the party, giving them a useful clue about the adventure
(unless, of course, they foolishly attack it). To fill the spots of
the creatures he set aside, the DM repeated a few entries, meaning
they may show up slightly more frequently than might be expected.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This is another simple form
of encounter table. Here, the creature frequency percentages can be
used directly. To create a percentile table, the DM repeats the steps
given above for selecting and grouping his encounters, again opting
not to use the efreeti or the brass dragon. Then the number of
creatures at each frequency is divided into the percentage for that
frequency (70%, 20%, 7%, and 3%, respectively, for common, uncommon,
rare, and very rare). In the earlier example, the list includes six
common monsters. (70%), resulting in an 11% spread per monster (66%
total). This is repeated for the monsters in each category. The
resulting number is the dice range for each creature. Using these
values as a guide, he arranges the creatures into a table.</font></p>

Encounter Tables</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Dungeon encounter tables are
normally set up according to levels—1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. Each level
is a relative measure of the power of those creatures on it. In
general, the level of the table corresponds to character level,
although characters may also encounter and defeat (or be challenged
by) creatures from higher or lower level tables. Generally, when
adventuring in a dungeon, characters should meet random encounters
that are equal to or no more than two levels higher or lower than
their own.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes dungeons themselves
are arranged in levels (although this is by no means required). In
this case, the dungeon level and the encounter table correspond.
Characters on the 1st-level of the dungeon would encounter creatures
from the first level encounter table. This not only keeps the power
of the monsters in line with the strength of a typical party, it also
maintains the logical structure of the dungeon level. It doesn't make
much sense for extremely powerful monsters to mingle freely (and
without consequence) among the weaker creatures that inhabit the
level.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When constructing the
encounter table, creatures with a greater or lesser power than the
table being designed can be used. However, each level of difference
between creature and table decreases the frequency of appearance by
one (a common creature becomes uncommon, a rare creature would be
very rare, and so on). Creatures less powerful than the given level
seldom venture into such dangerous territory. Creatures more powerful
are seldom met to ensure the player characters have a decent chance
of survival. After adjustment, these creatures can be added to the
table.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition, there is a
chance that an encountered creature will be more powerful than
expected: When designing a 2-20 table, the 20 result could be &quot;Use
next highest table&quot;; if a percentile table is used, 98-100 could
bump the DM to the next table. Thus, players would never be assured
of safety or good odds.</font></p>

<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Wilderness
Encounter Tables</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Unlike the dungeon tables,
those used for the wilderness are not so neatly organized according
to deadliness or power. One principle of wilderness adventuring
(which makes it more dangerous for low-level characters) is that
virtually any creature can be met—and often in sizeable numbers.
This is a risk the players should be aware of before they take their
characters out into the untracked forest.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This does not mean that
wilderness adventuring should be impossible for low-level characters.
It shouldn't be so deadly that they can't walk three steps before a
flight of red dragons appears and turns them to ash with one fiery
breath! That's just bad refereeing. Low-level characters should have
the opportunity to go on wilderness adventures that they can survive.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Perhaps an area of the nearby
forest is regularly patrolled by the King's Wardens who drive off the
greater threats to the safety of the population. Lone monsters often
escape their notice and sometimes raid the outlying farms. Special
encounter tables can be created to reflect the lower levels of
monsters that do manage to lurk in these woods, providing low-level
characters with a decent but not overpowering challenge.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The greatest consideration in
creating wilderness encounter tables is to have a separate table for
each type of terrain. These need not be created all at once, although
tables must exist for the terrain types the characters have to enter
during the course of an adventure. Different terrain types that can
be used include the following:</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Wilderness encounter tables
can reflect more than just terrain. There are differences between the
jungles of Africa and those of Asia or South America. Different areas
of jungle (or plains or whatever) can have different properties in a
fantasy world, too.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, an area's level
of civilization should be taken into account. There might be tables
for settled farmlands, border areas, and barely explored plains. All
cover the same type of terrain, but there are vast differences in the
types of encounters.</font></p>

Encounter Tables</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition to tables for
dungeons and wilderness areas, the DM can create others for any type
of special situation he creates. The most common of these are
encounter tables for towns and cities. These are not properly
wilderness and certainly aren't dungeons. The players shouldn't
expect to meet bands of ravening beasts intent on death and
destruction (unless it's a very peculiar city!).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Town and city encounters will
be with people, mostly player character races, of different social
classes and occupations. Guardsmen, merchants, beggars, urchins,
teamsters, and craftsmen plying their trade are all likely encounters
for a city.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A single encounter table will
do for most small villages and towns. Such places have a great deal
in common, although the DM can certainly create distinctions between
villages on the coast and those well inland.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Cities, however, tend to have
unique characters. Just as Los Angeles is different from New York or
Paris from Marseilles, different cities in a fantasy world should
feel different to the characters. Each major city should have a
unique encounter table to reflect these differences.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Indeed, even within a city
there may be different encounter tables to reflect the character of
the city's districts. The villas on the hillside are no less
dangerous than the waterfront, but these dangers take more subtle and
insidious forms.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In the end, there is no limit
to the degree of subdivision that can be applied to encounter tables.
Cities, individual districts, specific complexes within those
districts, and buildings within those complexes could all have
separate encounter tables. However, they do not need to. The DM
should only concern himself with those areas he knows or thinks the
players are going to frequent! There is no reason to do pointless
work—the DM has enough responsibility already.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, suppose the DM
decides to create tables for the Empire of Orrim. Orrim stretches
from the Harr Mountains to the Sea of Faldor. North of it lies the
Forest of Bane, a place noted for its evil denizens. Most of the
empire is agricultural, but the mountain district is heavily devoted
to mining. Several large, underground complexes have been built.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are two major
cities—Sulidam, the capital, located on the coast, and Coralport, a
pirate stronghold on an island offshore. To limit his work, the DM
decides to start the characters in a small village of the mining
district, close to an abandoned mine (his dungeon).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	First, the DM creates the
following tables:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	    </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>•
</b></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Dungeon levels 1-4

</b></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Black Opal Inn (the
residence of the player characters)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After a while, the characters
want to go exploring. Now the DM adds some new encounter tables to
his collection. These include:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	    </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>•
</b></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Settled mountains
(for low-level wilderness)</font></p>

when the characters travel to the capital)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Working in this manner, the
DM gradually creates a complete set of encounter tables. When he is
finished, his collection might look like this, in addition to those
already mentioned.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For DMs willing to devote
more time to advance preparation, another good trick is to slowly
build a collection of file cards describing special encounters. Each
card could have a more detailed description of a person, creature,
group, or thing on it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once the DM has this
collection, &quot;Special Encounter&quot; entries can be added to
random encounter tables. When a special encounter occurs, the DM
chooses a card from his collection and uses the detailed information
there to role-play the encounter. Some possible special encounters
include:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>The

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">of a creature,
complete with a small map, short key, tactics, and special treasure.
(For example, &quot;The nest of a female wyvern and her brood located
in an aerie on the side of a cliff. Woven into the nest are two suits
of </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>chain mail +1.&quot;</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">)</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">of an NPC,
including weapons, magical items, spells (if any), goods, physical
appearance, attitudes, companions, and perhaps even a mission or
story. (For example, &quot;The friar seeking companionship along a
lonely trail who is really a bandit leading the party into a trap.&quot;)</font></p>

breaks out on a city street after a band of Voorish outlanders,
squabbling with a merchant, overturn his melon cart.&quot;)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The great advantage of these
special encounters is that there is no requirement to use them at any
given time. The DM can prepare such cards in his spare time and
produce them whenever he needs them. Players will become convinced
that the DM is a genius, and his game will never be dull.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Random encounters need not be
limited to NPCs and monsters. All manner of things can be included,
dangerous or just mysterious. Other possibilities for encounter
tables include:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Shrieks in the distance</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Traps</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The clatter of a rock falling
from the ceiling</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All of these help build
atmosphere. Furthermore, if these are cleverly mixed with real
encounters that begin in similar ways, players become attentive and
involved. Exploring a dark, dank cave where hideous beasts may live,
with only a guttering torch, should be a nervous and scary event.
Adding &quot;fake'' random encounters will give players some idea of
the uncertainty their characters experience. If nothing else, this
kind of encounter will give players some respect for the risks their
imaginary characters are taking!</font></p>

terrain (or dungeons) may make checks more or less frequent.
Furthermore, the type of terrain and population density will affect
the chance the characters have a meaningful encounter. Table 56 lists
both the frequency of checks and the chance that an encounter will
occur for the most common wilderness situations. If characters are
adventuring in other types of terrain, the DM can use a comparable
entry from the table or can determine frequency and chance of

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The chance of having an
encounter can be modified by several factors. Foremost of these is
population density. The chances of an encounter listed on Table 56

patrolled or sparsely settled, the chance of an encounter increases
by one. In heavily populated areas, the chance of an encounter
increases by two. These modifiers should not be used unless the DM
has specially prepared encounter tables to reflect the differences
between settled lands and wilderness, however.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM can also choose to
modify the chance of an encounter for any other reason he feels is
justified. If the characters have been making excessive noise or if
the village alarm has been sounded, the DM can increase the chance of
an encounter. The DM can even decide arbitrarily that an encounter
will occur, although it can hardly be considered random any more.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the DM deems part of a
dungeon particularly dangerous, the number of checks can be increased
to once per turn (10 minutes of game time). The DM can also increase
the chance of an encounter occurring. If the characters engage in an
activity that makes excessive noise (hammering spikes or taking part
in a loud battle), an encounter check should be made immediately.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Any time the DM feels his
adventure is dragging along or that characters are getting
over-confident, he can declare a random encounter. Likewise if he
feels that a random encounter would hurt the adventure, he can ignore
one that's called for. Good judgment and story considerations are
more important than slavish devotion to procedure.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the DM decides that yes,
this encounter should happen, he determines how many creatures or
NPCs appear. There is no quick and easy formula for this. Experience
is the best guide. The </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Monstrous
Compendium</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> lists a
typical encounter size for each monster. Use this as a guideline,
especially when you're first starting out as a DM, but don't follow
this inflexibly.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When uncertain, use a small
encounter. It is far better for a random encounter to be easily
defeated by the player characters than it is for the monster to
overwhelm them. An easy PC victory gives the DM information and
experience (so he'll know to increase the difficulty of the next
encounter) without harming the player characters and his campaign. A
crushing PC defeat is almost impossible to correct without obvious
manipulation once the encounter has begun.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As always, use common sense
when determining how big an encounter is. Nature provides some
guidelines. Bear these in mind when figuring encounter size.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Many predators, especially
those that hunt by night, are solitary creatures. A nocturnal fantasy
creature might show up alone, as well.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of the predators that hunt by
daylight, some work alone while others cooperate in groups of two or
three. One or two will attack the prey from one direction while the
others wait for it to be flushed toward them. Such hunters are
usually stronger and faster than their prey. Again, fantasy creatures
can follow this pattern.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Smaller predators sometimes
hunt in packs of 5 to 12, attempting to surround and harry a chosen
victim. Herbivorous animals tend to flavor herds and the company of
others. Omnivores live in smaller groups and often have older members
that act as guards. All of these factors can play a part in the size
of a given encounter.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Before an encounter begins, a
check for surprise may be necessary. Given the right conditions, it
is possible for either side in an encounter to surprise the other. In
essence, the encounter is just as random for the monsters as it is
for the player characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

is not always assured nor is the check always necessary. Light,
excessive noise, and other types of prior warning can cancel the need
for the check. Surprise isn't usually possible when no form of
concealment is possible (as in the case of two ships at sea), though
darkness, storms, fog, and the like do act as concealment.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In some cases, one side may
be able to surprise the other without the other group having the same
opportunity. This is particularly true when the player characters are

the monsters can try to sneak closer and get the jump on the player
characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When making a surprise roll,
there are many factors that can increase or decrease the chance of
surprise. Some of these are very exotic or very particular to a
situation, but others can be anticipated. The more common modifiers
are listed on Table 57. By comparing other situations to these
modifiers, the DM has a guideline for making appropriate adjustments.</font></p>

can easily say, &quot;They snarl and leap to the defense!&quot;
Selection of the reaction based on the situation ensures rational
behavior and avoids the illogical results that random die rolls can
often give.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, there are times when
the DM doesn't have a clue about what the monsters will do. This is
not a disaster—it's not even all that unusual. When this happens,
the DM can randomly determine an encounter reaction by rolling for a
result on Table 59. To use the table, roll 2d10 and add the numbers
on the two dice. Increase or decrease this number by any modifiers in
the creature description or the morale modifiers (see Table 50 in
Chapter 9: Combat).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Using the column that most
closely matches the behavior of the player characters, find the entry
listed for modified die roll. The result is a general indication of
how the creatures will react. This reaction must be interpreted by
the DM to fit the situation.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM has accidentally
pitted his player characters against a group of creatures too
powerful for them, so much so that the player characters are doomed.
To fix things, the DM can have the monsters flee in inexplicable
panic; secretly lower their hit points; allow the player characters
to hit or inflict more damage than they really should; have the
monsters miss on attacks when they actually hit; have the creatures
make grievous mistakes in strategy (like ignoring the thief moving in
to strike from behind).</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes the DM discovers
his random encounters gave away too much treasure. In this case, he
can have more monsters of the same or more powerful type appear on
the scene. (The first group stole the treasure and these fellows want
it back; or the first was carrying the tribe's treasury to
safe-keeping; or the new group has been trailing the first to rob
them, and now takes a very dim view of the characters getting all the
loot.) In many ways this is like those westerns where everyone winds
up fighting over the gold. In this case, the monsters don't want to
annihilate the player characters so much as get the loot and run.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Of all the things the DM
does—judging combats, interpreting the actions of the player
characters, creating adventures, assigning experience—of all the
things he can possibly do, nothing is more important to the AD&amp;D
game than the creation and handling of nonplayer characters (NPCs).
Without nonplayer characters, the AD&amp;D game is nothing, an empty
limbo. The AD&amp;D game is a role-playing game, and for the players
to role-play, they must have something or someone to interact with.
That's what NPCs are for, to provide the player characters with
friends, allies, and villains. Without these, role-playing would be
very dull.	</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	An NPC is any person or
creature the player characters must deal with and that the DM has to
role-play. The player characters must deal with a trap, but the DM
doesn't role-play a trap. It's not an NPC. A charging dragon </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>is</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
an NPC—the DM acts out the part of the dragon and the players
decide how their characters are going to react to it. There are times
when the DM's role-playing choices are simple (run away or charge),
but often the DM's roles are quite challenging.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For convenience, NPC
encounters are generally divided into two broad categories: monsters
(those living things that aren't player character races) and full
NPCs (races the player characters commonly deal with). The range of
reactions in a monster encounter is generally less than in a full NPC
encounter.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM has to think of
himself as a master actor, quick-change artist, and impressionist.
Each NPC is a different role or part the DM must quickly assume.
While this may be difficult at first, practice makes the task much
easier. Each DM develops certain stock characters and learns the
personalities of frequently used NPCs.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are many different
categories of NPCs, but the most frequently encountered are common,
everyday folk. Player characters deal with innkeepers, stablers,
blacksmiths, minstrels, watchmen, petty nobles, and others, many of
whom can be employed by player characters. These NPCs are grouped
together as hirelings.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The Assassin, the Spy, and the
Sage</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Three experts, the assassin,
spy, and sage, require special treatment. Each of these, unlike other
hirelings, can affect the direction and content of an on-going
adventure. Used carefully and sparingly, these three are valuable DM
tools to create and shape stories in a role-playing campaign.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Assassins</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Assassination is not a
discreet occupation per se, but a reprehensible mind-set. The
assassin requires no special skills, though fighting, stealth, and
even magic are useful. All that is really needed to be an assassin is
the desire and the opportunity.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Hiring
an Assassin:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">When a player
character hires an assassin (which is </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>not</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
a good or lawful act), he is taking a chance. There is virtually no
way to assure oneself of the reliability and dependability of such a
person. Anyone willing to make a business out of murder is not likely
to have a high degree of morals of any type. Clearly, this is a case
of &quot;let the buyer beware!&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once a character has hired an
assassin, it is up to the DM to determine the success of the deed.
There are no simple tables or formulae to be followed.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Consider
the intended victim:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Assassination
attempts by one player character against another should not be
allowed. This type of behavior only leads to bitterness, bickering,
and anger among the players. NPC-sponsored assassination attempts
against player characters should be used sparingly, and then only as
plot motivators, not as punishment or player controls. Any time a
player character is targeted, role-play the encounter fairly—give
the PC a chance.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the intended victim is an
NPC, the DM should decide the effect of the assassination on his
game. Sometimes, player characters do these things out of spite. At
other times the deed may be motivated by simple greed. Neither of
these is a particularly good motive to encourage in a campaign.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the death of the NPC would
result in a major reworking of the campaign for no good reason,
consider seriously the idea of making the attempt fail. If the death
of the NPC would allow the player characters to by-pass or breeze
through an adventure you have planned, then it's not a good idea.
Don't just tell the players, &quot;Oh, that'd be bad for the game so
you can't even try to knock that guy off.&quot; Work the attempt—and
its failure—into the storyline.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Precautions:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If you decide
the attempt is legitimate, consider the precautions the intended NPC
victim normally takes. These may make the job particularly difficult
or easy. Kings, emperors, high priests, and other important officials
tend to be very cautious and well-protected. Wizards, with wise
magical precautions, can be virtually impossible to assassinate!
Devise specific NPC precautions before you know the assassin's plans.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Wizards make use of </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>magic
mouth, alarm, explosive runes,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
and other trap spells. Priests often rely on divination-oriented
items to foresee the intentions of others. Both could have
extra-dimensional or other-planar servants and guards. They may also
have precautions to foil common spells such as </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>ESP,
clairvoyance,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> and
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>detect magic.</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
Kings, princes, and other nobles have the benefit of both magical and
clerical protection in addition to a host of possibly fanatically
loyal bodyguards. If the victim has advance warning or suspects an
attempt, further precautions may be taken, and the job can become
even more difficult.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>The
Plan:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">After you have
decided (secretly) what precautions are reasonable, have the player
describe the plan he thinks would work best. This can be simple or
involved, depending on the cunning of the player. This is the plan
the assassin, not the player character, will use, therefore the
player can presume some resources not available to the player
character. However, you must decide if these resources are reasonable
and truly exist.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, if the player
says the assassin has a map of the castle, you must tell him if this
is reasonable (and, unless the victim is extremely secretive and
paranoid, it is). A plan involving a thousand men or an 18th-level
thief is not reasonable. The player character hasn't hired an entire
arsenal!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, compare what you
know of the precautions to the plan and the success or failure will
usually become clear. Ultimately, the DM should not allow
assassinations to succeed if he doesn't want them to succeed!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In general, allowing player
characters to hire assassins should not be encouraged. Hiring an NPC
to kill even a horrible villain defeats the purpose of heroic
role-playing. If the player characters can't accomplish the deed, why
should they be allowed to hire NPCs to do the same thing?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Overuse of assassins can
often result in bitter feelings and outright feuding—player vs.
player or player vs DM. Neither of these is fun or healthy for a
game. Finally, it is a very risky business. Assassins do get caught
and generally have no compunctions about confessing who their
employer is. Once the target learns this, the player character will
have a very dangerous life. Then the player character can discover
the joy and excitement of having assassins looking for him!</font></p>
<p class="western" >

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Spies</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	While less reprehensible
(perhaps) than assassins, spies involve many of the same risks and
problems. First and foremost, a spy, even more than an assassin, is
inherently untrustworthy. Spying involves breaking a trust.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A spy, unlike a scout,
actively joins a group in order to betray it. A person who can so
glibly betray one group could quite easily betray another, his
employer perhaps. While some spies may be nobly motivated, these
fellows are few and far between. Furthermore, there is no way to be
sure of the trustworthiness of the spy. It is a paradox that the
better the spy is, the less he can be trusted. Good spies are master
liars and deceivers even less trustworthy than bad spies (who tend to
get caught any way).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In role-playing, spies create
many of the same problems as assassins. First, in allowing player
characters to hire spies, the DM is throwing away a perfectly good
role-playing adventure! Having the characters do their own spying can
lead to all manner of interesting possibilities.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Even if NPC spies are
allowed, there is still the problem of success. Many variables should
be considered: What precautions against spies have been taken? How
rare or secret is the information the character is trying to learn?
How talented is the NPC spy? How formidable is the NPC being spied
upon?</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In the end, the rule to use
when judging a spy's success is that of dramatic effect. If the spy's
information will create an exciting adventure for the player
characters without destroying the work the DM has put into the
campaign world, it is best for the spy to succeed.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the spy's information will
short-circuit a well-prepared adventure or force the DM to rework
vast sections of the campaign world, the spy should not succeed.
Finally, the spy can appear to succeed while, actually, failing—even
if he does return with information, it may not be wholly accurate. It
may be slightly off or wildly inaccurate. The final decision about
the accuracy of a spy's information should be based on what will make
for the best adventure for the player characters.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A sage's ability
can be handled in one of two ways. First, since the DM must answer
the question any way, he can simply decide if the sage knows the
answer. As usual, the consideration of what is best for the story
must be borne in mind.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the player characters
simply can't proceed with the adventure without this answer, then the
sage knows the answer. If the answer will reward clever players (for
thinking to hire a sage, for example) and will not destroy the
adventure, then the sage may know all or part of the answer. If
answering the question will completely unbalance the adventure, the
sage doesn't know the answer.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of course, there are times it
is impossible to tell the effect of knowing or not knowing something.
In this case, the sage's answer can be determined by a proficiency
check, modified by the nature of the question. The DM can decide the
sage's ability or use the following standard: Sage ability is equal
to 14 plus 1d6 (this factors in his proficiency and normal ability
scores).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the proficiency check is
passed (the number required, or less, on 1d20), the sage provides an
answer. If a die roll of 20 is made, the sage comes up with an
incorrect answer. The DM should create an incorrect answer that will
be believable and consistent with what the players already know about
the adventure.</font></p>

accurate answer. Precision modifiers are listed on Table 62.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a question is particularly
complex, the DM can divide it into several parts, each requiring a
separate roll. Thus, a sage may only know part of the information
needed. This can be very good for the story, especially if some key
piece of information is left out.</font></p>

formidable. At the very least, a sage must have access to a library
of considerable size to complete his work. He is not a walking
encyclopedia, able to spout facts on command. A sage answers
questions by having the right resources at hand and knowing how to
use them. The size and quality of the sage's library affect his
chance of giving a correct answer.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This library can belong to
the sage or can be part of an institution. Monasteries and
universities typically maintained libraries in medieval times. If a
personal library, it must be at least 200 square feet of rare and
exotic manuscripts, generally no less than 1,000 gp per book. If the
library is connected with an institution, the sage (or his employer)
will be expected to make appropriate payments or tithes for its use.
Expenses in the range of 1,000 gp a day could be levied against the
character. Of course, a sage can attempt to answer a question with
little or no library, but his chances of getting the right answer
will be reduced as given on Table 62.</font></p>

sometimes more time than a player character can afford. Player
characters can attempt to rush a sage in his work, but only at the
risk of a wrong answer. The normal length of time depends on the
nature of the question and is listed on Table 63. Player characters
can reduce the sage's time by one category on this table, but the
chance that the sage's answer will be incorrect or not available
grows. These modifiers are also listed on Table 62.</font></p>

troop type is given here. In addition, specific historical examples
are also provided. More examples can be found in books obtainable at
a good wargame shop or at your local library. The more specific you
make your soldier descriptions, the more detail and color can be
added to a fantasy campaign.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

a fantasy game. No mention is made in these rules of the vast numbers
of strange and bizarre troops that might guard a castle or appear on
a battlefield. It is assumed that all troop types described here are
human. Units of dwarves, elves, and more are certainly possible, but
they are not readily available as hirelings. The opportunity to
employ these types is going to depend on the nature of the campaign
and the DM's wishes. As a guideline, however, no commander (such as
the knight of a castle) should have more than one or two exceptional
(i.e., different from his own race) units under his command.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This is a
footsoldier, typically armed with a shortbow, arrows, short sword,
and leather armor. In history, archers were known to operate as light
infantry when necessary, but this was far from universal. Highland
Scots carried bows, arrows, two-handed swords, and shields, but no
armor. Turkish janissaries were elite troops armed with bow and
scimitar, but unarmored. Byzantine psilos carried composite short
bows, hand axes, and, if lucky, chain or scale armor. A Venetian
stradiot archer (often found on ships) normally had a short bow, long
sword, and banded armor.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">These troops are
more specialists than regular soldiers. Since their duty is to work
and service heavy catapults and siege equipment, they don't normally
enter into combat. They dress and outfit themselves as they please.
Artillerists stay with their equipment, which is found in the siege
train.</font></p>

scimitar, and leather armor, although armor up to chain is sometimes
worn. Historically, most mounted bowmen came from nomadic tribes or
areas of vast plains.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The most famous mounted
bowmen were the Mongol horsemen, who commonly armed themselves with
composite short bow, scimitar, mace, axe, and dagger. Some also
carried light lances. They wore studded leathers or whatever else
they could find, and carried medium shields. Pecheneg horsemen used
the composite short bow, hand axe, lasso, and light lance, and wore
scale armor. Russian troops carried the short bow and dagger and wore
padded armor.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The classic
image of the heavy cavalryman is the mounted knight. Such men are
typically armed with heavy lance, long sword, and mace. They wear
plate mail or field plate armor. The horse is a heavy war horse and
barded, although the type of barding varies.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Examples include the early
Byzantine kataphractos, armed with medium lance, long sword, banded
armor, and a large shield. They rode heavy war horses fitted with
scale barding. The French Compagnies d'Ordonnance fitted with heavy
lance, long sword, mace, and full plate on chain or plate barded
horses were classic knights of the late medieval period.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In other lands, the Polish
hussar was a dashing sight with his tiger-skin cloak fluttering in
the charge. He wore plate mail armor and rode an unbarded horse but
carried an arsenal of weapons—medium lance, long sword, scimitar,
warhammer, and a brace of pistols (although the latter won't normally

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">These are
skirmishers whose role in combat is to gallop in quickly, make a
sudden attack, and get away before they can attacked in force. They
are also used as scouts and foragers, and to screen advances and
retreats. They carry a wide variety of weapons, sometimes including a
missile weapon. Their armor is nonexistent or very light—padded
leathers and shields. Speed is their main strength. In many ways they
are indistinguishable from mounted bowmen and often come from the
same groups of people.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The stradiotii of the Italian
Wars were unarmored and fought with javelins, saber, and shield.
Hussars were armed with scimitar and lance. Byzantine trapezitos
carried similar weapons, but wore padded armor and carried a medium
shield. Turkish sipahis, noted light cavalrymen, carried a wide
variety of weapons, usually a sword, mace, lance, short bow, and
small shield.</font></p>

forms the backbone of most mounted forces—it's cheaper to raise
medium cavalry than heavy knights, and the medium cavalryman packs
more punch than light cavalry. They normally ride unarmored horses
and wear scale, chain, or banded armor. Typical arms include lance,
long sword, mace, and medium shield.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A good example of medium
cavalry was the Normal knight with lance, sword, chain mail, and kite

crossbowmen are favored by some commanders, replacing regular archers
in many armies. The crossbow requires less training than the bow, and
is easier to handle, making these soldiers cheaper in the long run to
maintain. Each man normally has a light crossbow, short sword, and
dagger. Usually they do not wear armor. Crossbowmen fight
hand-to-hand only to save themselves and will fall back or flee from
attackers.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Italian crossbowmen commonly
wore padded armor and carried a long sword, buckler, and light
crossbow. Burgundians wore a light coat of chain and carried no
weapons other than their crossbows. Greek crossbowmen carried a

crossbowmen are given horses, for extra mobility. All use light
crossbows, since heavier ones cannot be cocked on horseback. The
horse is unbarded, and the rider normally wears little or no armor.
As with most light troops, the mounted crossbowmen relies on speed to
whisk him out of danger. An unusual example of a mounted crossbowmen

include Viking berserkers (no armor, but shield, and battle axe or

were Swiss and German pikemen (no armor, pike, and short sword),
Spanish sword-and-buckler men (leather armor, short sword, and

service, militiamen can be quite formidable.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some Italian militias were
well-equipped with banded or plate mail armor and glaives. The Irish
&quot;rising-out'' typically had no armor and fought with javelins
and long swords. Byzantine militias were well-organized and often
worked as archers (short bow and padded armor) in defense of city
walls. The Saxons' fyrd was supposedly composed of the freemen of a

These men, also known as miners or pioneers, provide the labor for

safety. If the position was attacked, the shieldbearer was expected
to fight as an infantryman. For this reason, shieldbearers have the

Hirelings</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Whether seeking everyday
workers or rare experts, the methods PCs use for employing hirelings
are generally the same. Basically, a player character advertises his
needs and seeks out the recommendations of others. Given enough
notice, hirelings will then seek out the player character.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Who
Might Be Offended?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When hiring, the first step
is to figure out if the player character is going to offend anyone,
particularly the ruler of the city or town. Feudal lords have very
specific ideas about their land and their property (the latter of
which sometimes includes the people on his land).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the hirelings are true
freedmen, they can decide to come and go as they please. More often,
the case is that the hirelings are bound to the fief. They are not
slaves, but they cannot leave the land without the permission of
their lord.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Depopulate
at Your Own Risk</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Depopulating an area will get
a strong negative reaction from local officials. If the player
character seeks only a few hirelings, he is not likely to run into
difficulty unless he wishes to take them away (i.e., back to his own
castle). This type of poaching will certainly create trouble.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If Targash, having
established his paladin's castle, needs 300 peasants to work the
field, he cannot go into the nearby town and recruit 300 people
without causing a reaction! The lord and the town burghers are going
to consider this tantamount to wholesale kidnapping.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, local officials have
this funny way of getting upset about strange armies. If Targash
comes into town to raise 300 heavy cavalry, the local lord is sure to
notice! No one likes strangers raising armies in their territory. It
is, after all, a threat to their power.</font></p>

Permission</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thus, in at least these three
situations, player characters would do well to secure the cooperation
of local officials before they do anything. Such cooperation is
rarely forthcoming without some kind of conditions: A noble may
require a cash bond before he will agree to release those under him;
guilds may demand concessions to regulate their craft within the
boundaries of the player character's lands; dukes and kings may
require treaties or even diplomatic marriages; burghers could ask for
protection or a free charter. Anything the DM can imagine and
negotiate with the player is a possibility.</font></p>

<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Finding
the Right People</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once a character has secured
permission, he can begin searching for the hirelings he needs. If he
needs craftsmen with specific skills, it is best to work through the
guild or local authorities. They can make the necessary arrangements
for the player character. This also obviates the need to role-play a
generally uninteresting situation. Of course, guilds generally charge
a fee for their services.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the character is seeking a
large number of unskilled men or soldiers, he can hire a crier to
spread the word. (Printing, being undiscovered or in an infant state,
is generally not a practical solution.) Fortunately, criers are
easily found and can be hired without complicated searching. Indeed,
even young children can be paid for this purpose.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the same time, the player
character would be wise to do his own advertising by leaving word
with innkeepers, stablers, and the owners of public houses.
Gradually, the DM makes applicants arrive.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the player character is
searching for a fairly common sort of hireling—laborers, most
commonly—the response is equal to approximately 10% of the
population in the area (given normal circumstances).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the position being filled
is uncommon, the response will be about 5% of the population.
Openings for soldiers might get one or two respondents in a village
of 50. In a city of 5,000 it wouldn't be unusual to get 250
applicants, a respectable company.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If searching for a particular
craft or specialist—a blacksmith or armorer, for instance—the
average response is 1% of the population or less. Thus, in a village
of 50, the character just isn't likely to find a smith in need of
employment. In a slightly larger village, he might find the
blacksmith's apprenticed son willing to go with him.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Unusual circumstances such as
a plague, a famine, a despotic tyrant, or a depressed economy, can
easily alter these percentages. In these cases, the DM decides what
is most suitable for his campaign. Furthermore, the player character
can increase the turnout by offering special inducements—higher
pay, greater social status, or special rewards. These can increase
the base percentage by 1% to 10% of the population.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The whole business becomes
much more complicated when hiring exotic experts—sages, spies,
assassins, and the like. Such talents are not found in every city.
Sages live only where they can continue their studies and where men
of learning are valued. Thus they tend to dwell in great cities and
centers of culture, though they don't always seek fame and notoriety
there. Making discreet enquiries among the learned and wealthy is an
effective way to find sages. Other experts make a point not to
advertise at all.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Characters who blurt out that
they are seeking to hire a spy or an assassin are going to get more
than just a raised eyebrow in reaction! Hiring these specialists
should be an adventure in itself.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, Fiera the Elf
has decided she needs the services of a spy to investigate the doings
of her archrival. The player, Karen, tells the DM what she intends,
setting the devious wheels of the DM's mind in motion. The DM plans
out a rough adventure and, when he is ready, tells Karen that her
character can begin the search.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Not knowing where to begin
(after all, where does one hire a spy?), Fiera starts to frequent
seamy and unpleasant bars, doing her best to conceal her true
identity. She leaves a little coin with the hostelers and word of her
needs. The DM is ready for this. He has prepared several encounters
to make Fiera's search interesting. There are drunken, over-friendly
mercenaries, little ferret-faced snitches, dark mysterious strangers,
and venal constables to be dealt with.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Eventually, the DM has
several NPCs contact Fiera, all interested in the job. Unknown to the
player (or her character) the DM has decided that one applicant is
really a spy sent by her rival to act as a double agent! Thus, from a
not-so-simple hiring, one adventure has been played and the potential
for more has been created.</font></p>

but most employers provide other benefits to their hirelings.
Appropriate room and board is expected for all but common laborers
and higher officials. Those falling in the middle range expect this
to be taken care of. Traveling expenses must come out of the PC's
pocket, as must any exceptional items of equipment or dress.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Important hirelings will also
expect gifts and perhaps offices to supplement their income. Soldiers
expect to be ransomed if captured, to have their equipment replaced
as needed, and to receive new mounts for those lost in combat. All of
these extra benefits add up quickly. Furthermore, most activities are
much more labor-intensive when compared to modern standards. More
workers are needed to perform a given job. More workers means greater
overall expenses and lower wages for each individual laborer.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	These costs cover only the
wages paid these nonplayer characters. It does not include the funds
necessary to provide provisions, maintain equipment, or expand
Targash's realm (a desire of many player characters). Over the course
of a year, Targash mush bring in at least 35,640 gp just to pay his
hirelings.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Considering a reasonable tax
to be one gold piece for each person and one or two silver for each
head of livestock, Targash must have a considerable number of people
or animals within the borders of his fief or go into debt!
Supplementing one's income thus becomes a good reason for
adventuring. However, even powerful, adventuring lords often find
themselves forced to borrow to maintain their households.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	And these costs don't even
begin to cover the salaries demanded by any extremely rare hirelings
Targash may need. Spies and assassins normally demand exorbitant
wages—5,000 to 10,000 gold pieces or more. And they are in a
position to get away with it. Aside from the fact that not many can
do their job, they can also force an employer to pay through
blackmail. The act of hiring must be secret, not only to succeed, but
to prevent the character from being embarrassed, disgraced, or worse.
Woe to the employer who attempts to cheat his assassin!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Others can also resort to
such blackmail. Mercenaries may refuse to go on campaign until they
are properly paid (a tactic used by the condottieri in Italy).
Peasants have been known to revolt. Guilds may withdraw their
support. Merchants can always trade elsewhere. All of these serve as
checks and balances on the uncontrolled power of any ruler from local
lord to powerful emperor.</font></p>

around. A henchman is a PC's friend, confidante, and ally. If this
aspect of the NPC is not stressed and played well, the henchman
quickly becomes nothing more than a cardboard character, depriving
the DM of a tool he can use to create a complete role-playing
experience. For the DM, a henchman is just that—a tool, a way of
creating an exciting story for the player characters.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There is no set time at which
a player character acquires a henchman. Running a player character
and a henchman together is more difficult than just a player
character alone. Not every player will be ready for this at the same
time, so the DM should control which players get henchmen and when.
Wait until the player has demonstrated the ability to role play his
own character before burdening him with another. If the player does
not assume at least some of the responsibility for role-playing the
henchman, the value is lost.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Neither is there a set way to
acquire a henchman. The DM must use his own judgment. Since a
henchman is a friend, consider those things that bind friends
together. Being treated as equals, helping without expecting reward,
trust, kindness, sharing secrets, and standing by each other in times
of trouble are all parts of it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a character does these
things for an NPC, a bond will develop between them. The DM can allow
the player to have more and more control over the NPC, deciding
actions, role-playing reactions, and developing a personality. As the
player does this, he begins to think of the NPC almost as another
player character. When the player is as concerned about the welfare
of the NPC as he would be for a normal player character, that NPC can
be treated as a henchman.</font></p>

Player Takes Over</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once the DM decides that an
NPC is a henchman, he should make two copies of the NPC's character
sheet, one for himself and one for the player. Not everything need be
revealed on the player's copy—the DM may choose to conceal
alignment, experience point totals, special magical items, or
character background. However, the player should have enough
information to role-play the henchman adequately. It is hard to run a
character properly without such basic information as Strength,
Intelligence, race, or level. Ideally, the player should not have to
ask the DM, &quot;Can my henchman do this?&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Naturally, the DM's character
sheet should have complete information on the henchman. Moreover, the
DM should also include a short description of the henchman in
appearance, habits, peculiarities, personality, and background. The
last two are particularly important.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Establishing the personality
of the henchman allows the DM to say, &quot;No, your henchman refuses
to do that,&quot; with reason. The astute player will pick up on this
and begin playing the henchman appropriately.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A little background allows
the DM to build adventures that grow out of the henchman's past. An
evil stranger may come hunting for him; his father may leave him a
mysterious inheritance; his wife (or husband) may arrive on the
doorstep. Even a little history is better than nothing.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A henchman should always be
of lower level than the player character. This keeps the henchman
from stealing the spotlight. If the henchman is equal or greater in
level, he could become as, or more, important than the player
character. The player might neglect his own character, an undesirable
result. Thus, if a henchman should reach an equal level, he will
depart the service of the player character and set out on his own
adventures. This doesn't mean he disappears forever. He is still
present in the campaign, can still show up periodically as a
DM-controlled NPC, and can still be considered a friend of the player
character.</font></p>

Henchmen</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The player is responsible for
deciding a henchman's actions, provided they are in character for the
NPC. This is one of the advantages of the henchman over the hireling.
The DM should only step in when the player is abusing or ignoring the
personality of the NPC.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, Fenris, a
henchman known for his sarcastic and somewhat self-centered view, has
been captured along with his master, Drelb the Halfling, by a band of
twisted trolls.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	DM (playing the trolls): &quot;Ha!
My brothers and I are going to roast one of you and let the other one
go! So, who's going to hang from the spit?&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Player: &quot;Well,
uh...Fenris remembers how many times Drelb has saved his life. He
volunteers.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	DM: &quot;Is Drelb telling
the trolls this? Fenris is going to be real upset if he is.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Player: &quot;No, no! It's
just what Fenris would do.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	DM: &quot;Sure. He thinks
about it and, you know, it doesn't seem like a real viable solution
to the problem. He leans over to Drelb and says, &quot;You always
wanted to sweat off a few pounds, Drelb.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Clearly, there are times when
the DM can step in and overrule a player decision regarding henchmen.
There are things a henchman simply will not do. The relationship is
supposed to be that of friendship. Therefore, anything that damages a
friendship sours a henchman. The DM should think about those things
he would never ask of a friend or have a so-called friend ask of him.
If it would ruin one of his own friendships, it will do the same in
the game.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, henchmen don't
give useful magical items to player characters, don't stand by
quietly while others take all the credit, don't take the blame for
things they didn't do, and don't let themselves be cheated. Anyone
who tries to do this sort of thing is clearly not a friend.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Henchmen don't, as a rule, go
on adventures without their player character friend unless the
purpose of the adventure is to rescue the PC from danger. They don't
appreciate being given orders by strangers (or even other player
characters), unless their PC friend is also taking orders.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As the henchman is played, it
is the player's responsibility to keep track of any information about
the henchman that isn't kept secret. Not only does this make running
the game a small bit easier for the DM, it forces the player to pay
attention to his henchman.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Among the things a player
should keep track of is a henchman's experience point total. Henchmen
do earn experience points from adventures and can advance in level.
However, since they are not full player characters, they only earn
half the experience a character would normally get.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	They also expect their fair
share of treasure and magical items discovered—more, if they took a
significant risk. They expect the same care and attention the player
character receives when they are injured or killed. Indeed it is
possible for a forsaken henchman to return as a vengeful spirit to
wreak havoc on those who abandoned him!</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some NPCs are available for
hire; others, because of social rank or profession, can be hired only
under special circumstances; still others can only be encountered
and, maybe, befriended, but never hired. Indeed characters are not
defined by profession only. Just as important (and sometimes more
important) is the NPC's social status.</font></p>

than a churl ploughman, even if his skills are more complicated. Some

of like the Old West, where there was always someone itching to beat

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For this reason, spellcasters
tend to be mysterious or, at least, quiet about their abilities.

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Assuming the player
characters know of a capable spellcaster, there is still the problem
of convincing the NPC to cast the desired spell. Often the NPC won't
even have the spell ready when the characters need it. After all, it
isn't every day a cleric needs to cast a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>raise

need a day just to rest and memorize the desired spell.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The faith of the
player characters and the ethos of the NPC's religion may pose an
even greater problem than spell availability. It is quite possible
for a cleric to refuse to cast a spell to aid an &quot;unbeliever,''
&quot;heathen,'' or &quot;heretic.'' Some may agree, but only at the
cost of a donation, service, or conversion. A rare few accept any and
all without passing any judgment. In general, it is best to seek the
services of a like-minded cleric than to go to a stranger.</font></p>

clerical spellcasters and most nonclerical types, spellcasting is
more a matter of finances than philosophies. If the characters find a
capable spellcaster, they must be prepared to pay (and pay dearly)
for his services. For a desperately needed service, the NPC knows he
has the player characters over a barrel and will bargain accordingly.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If player characters have the
nerve to ask NPCs (not hirelings or henchmen) to use up valuable
magical items or charges from these, they are going to get a very
cold reaction. Consider how often player characters sell or give away
the magic items they find during their adventures. Nonplayer
characters will have about the same likelihood of selling (or
giving!) powerful magic away. Offering to buy a charge from a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>staff
of healing</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> is just
plain insulting. No NPC's reaction is going to be improved by the
offer.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	More than what they can do,
how much they cost, or how loyal they are, NPCs live only when they
have personalities. Poorly played, an NPC can easily be reduced to
nothing more than a collection of numbers, spells, equipment, and
automatic reactions—a role-playing automaton. Vivid NPCs are much
more than this. These characters, developed and acted by the DM, are
complete. They have quirks, likes, dislikes, habits, ambitions, and
desires. In one way or another they fire and remain in the
imagination of the players</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some DMs have the naturally
ability to create such characters on the spur of the moment,
improvising as they go along. This is a rare gift, not possessed by
most. However, this doesn't mean any DM can't create good NPCs. All
that's required is a little effort.</font></p>

physical trait—baldness, pot-bellied, bad teeth, wheezy, and
more—can be stressed. This helps fix the appearance of the NPC in

traits, simple habits—scratches his head, tugs on his beard, stares
at the sky when talking, or mumbles—can be used. The DM can
actually act out these simple habits at the table, adding a visual

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For very important NPCs,
hirelings, and henchmen, the DM is going to need more than just a
single character feature. Saying that a hireling is greedy is not
enough. It doesn't make him any different from all the other greedy
NPCs the player characters have met.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Perhaps he struggles to
control his natural greediness out of loyalty. He may break into cold
sweats and become nervous when the player character accidentally
tempts him (&quot;Here, hold my horse while I go see what's making
that noise.&quot;). Will he remain loyal or will his baser nature get
the best of him? The answer to this question should come out through
role-playing.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Enough little questions like
this—and enough role-played answers—will bring the NPC's true
character into focus. And if the DM pays attention to the personality
of the NPCs, the players will also learn and study those characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Creating
an NPC Personality:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The best way to
create a personality is to use whatever seems right and not worry
about carefully constructing a background and rationale for the
character. The DM has to keep careful notes about each major NPC,
adding to it each play session. After several sessions, the NPC may
have a complete background and personality, one that has come out
little-by-little during play.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Alternatively, the DM can
prepare a personality in advance. This simply means he prepares some
background notes before he begins to play that character. This is
useful for powerful villains and important officials. However, during
play, the DM should be flexible enough to change any part of the
NPC's background that just doesn't work.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To aid in the process of
creating NPCs, Table 70 lists different types of attitudes,
tendencies, and habits. These are organized into major traits, with
similar characteristics grouped under each.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM can choose a major
trait and any appropriate characteristics; he can randomly determine
the major trait (rolling 1d20) and select appropriate
characteristics; or he can randomly determine everything (1d20 for a
major trait, percentile dice for characteristics).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, the DM randomly
determines a hireling is careless, selects thoughtless from that
sub-group and then rolls for an additional characteristic, getting
cheerful. The end result is somewhat scatter-brained, happy-go-lucky
person.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This table is provided to
spur the imagination of the DM, although it can be used to create
completely random personalities. However, random methods often lead
to confusing and seemingly impossible combinations! If a result seems
totally impossible or unplayable, don't use it simply because that's
how the dice rolls came up. Whenever possible, the DM should decide
the personality of the NPC!</font></p>

NPC Characteristics</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of course, NPCs are more than
just personalities and character traits. Each NPC, like each player
character, has abilities and a unique physical appearance. However,
considering NPCs come from the entire range of humanity (and some
fantasy races, as well!), no tables are given to fill in these
details. A few tables simply cannot do justice to the huge variety of
an entire game world.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, the physical
appearance and abilities should be determined by the needs of the
story, not random choice. If the player characters are dealing with
an innkeeper, the NPC should be an ordinary person, not a powerful
member of a character class. Furthermore, he should act, dress and
behave like an innkeeper. Therefore, the DM could decide the
innkeeper is fat and florid, over-talkative, with no exceptional
ability scores.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	On the other hand, say the
PCs encounter a mysterious stranger, a character of great power.
Here, the DM decides the stranger's mere appearance radiates a
powerful charismatic appeal. The stranger's Charisma score is
exceptionally high. To make the NPC even more impressive, the DM
assigns him a character class and quite a high level.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In both examples above, the
DM decided what effect he wanted from the NPC and built the character
around that.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Every aspect of an NPC is a
tool for the DM. Some are quite obvious, others may arise only in
special occasions. Listed below are some of the areas a DM can use to
create a distinctive character. Some descriptive words have been
listed for each area to spur the imagination. A good thesaurus can
provide even more adjectives useful for describing characters.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of course, there are
thousands of possible NPC aspects that could also be used: skin
color, stature, bearing, gait, and eye color are only a few more.
Sometimes it is useful for a DM to make a list of all the words he
can think of that describe a person. Once such a list is made, the DM
can keep that with his game notes, ready to use any time he needs to
quickly characterize an NPC.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Since NPCs, even henchmen,
are supposed to be unique personalities, they are not slavishly
obedient or bound to the player characters. Thus, NPCs associated
with the player characters in any way must have a morale rating. This
rating is for the DM's use only and is always kept secret from the
players.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	An NPC's morale rating
depends on his position, his personality, the quality of his
treatment, and the player character. Henchmen and hirelings each have
a base morale which is then modified by a number of factors.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The base morale for henchmen
is 12 and the base for a hireling is 10. The modifiers to the base
morale are given on Table 71 below and on Table 50.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	* These modifiers also appear
on Table 50. Do not apply them twice.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	An NPC must roll a morale
check when the combat rules call for one (see &quot;Morale&quot; in
Chapter 9). In combat situations, the NPC who fails a morale check
will retreat or flee as noted under Combat. The DM can require other
checks as he feels are appropriate.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Morale checks are also
appropriate when an NPC is faced with temptation. A failed roll means
the NPC gives in to the temptation. Note that temptation can take
many forms other than outright bribes. The opportunity to right an
injustice, strike back at a hated employer, work for one's real
beliefs, or get revenge for a long-held grudge are all forms of
temptation.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For such subtle forms of
temptation, the NPC's reaction may not be immediately obvious to the
player characters. The NPC may desert in time of need, spy on a
player character, rob the character of some valuable item, attempt to
assassinate the player character, or directly betray the player
character to his enemies. Indeed, he may remain in the service of the
player character for a long time after the check has failed, waiting
for his opportunity to strike.</font></p>

NPCs</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Creating a full-blown NPC
with a history, unique physical characteristics, personality traits,
skills, a morale rating, and so on, is a time-consuming process,
something the DM can't do in the middle of a game session.
Fortunately, there are quick ways around this problem. By using
these, the DM can create NPCs on the spot without slowing down his
game sessions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

Create only as much of the character as the players are going to see
in the game.</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">First and
foremost, the DM should never create more than he needs. Running a
role-playing game is a big job and there is no need to create more
work than is necessary.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If an NPC is just an
innkeeper or a groom or a smith, the DM doesn't need ability scores,
proficiencies, or detailed lists of equipment. All he really needs is
a physical description and a personality.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When the player characters
run into a hostile fighter, personality is not tremendously
important. In this case all that is needed is level, Strength,
weapons, and Armor Class.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>2.
Create and use stock characters but don't let them dominate.</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">While it is fine
to have every innkeeper and groom and smith different, this creatures
a lot of work on the DM. Some DMs are quick enough and creative
enough actors to do this with no problem; others are not. There is
nothing wrong with having a standard or stock shopkeeper or peasant.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If an NPC is minor or
unimportant, role-playing a detailed and intriguing personality can
even get in the way of the story! The players may remember that
character and perhaps forget more important ones. They may decide
this minor character is important to the plot. In a sense, the DM's
creation has stolen the scene.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Balancing major and minor
characters isn't easy, however. If all the minor NPCs are stock
characters, the game will eventually become dull and boring. The
players will resign themselves to meeting yet another crotchety, old
peasant or greedy and suspicious innkeeper.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>3.
Create as you go.</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The DM can start
with nothing more than an idea of what he wants an NPC to be like and
then ad lib the personality and description during the course of
play. This allows to him to create a character that interacts with
the imaginations of the players, since the DM reacts to their
suggestions and actions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, the DM who does this
has to be careful to be consistent. This can be hard since he is
making it all up on the fly. He should be sure to keep notes of what
each NPC does and what he becomes as he develops. This way the NPC
can remain the same from game session to game session.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>4.
Do your homework before and after game sessions.</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If the DM knows
the characters are going to meet a particular NPC, he should at least
make some basic notes about that character before the start of the
game. These may be only a few scribbles about personality, but it
will at least provide a starting point.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	After a game session, the DM
should add to those notes, expanding them with anything that came up
during that session. If these notes are maintained and the NPCs filed
so they can be found again, the DM will have less and less work to do
each time. With time, important NPCs, stock characters, and
improvised encounters will take on unique personalities and
backgrounds. This enriches the game for everyone and makes that DM's
game just that much better than the next guy's.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If player characters are
using light to find their way, then not only can they see, but they
can also be seen. Hiding one's light is impossible in this case.
Characters using a light to find their way can even be watched by
creatures beyond the range of their own light. Since the light source
illuminates the area around the player characters, it makes them
visible to people or creatures out to the watchers' normal visibility
ranges. The radius of the light source isn't the issue in this
situation.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, on a clear
plain, a raiding party of orcs could easily see the light of a fire
and the silhouettes cast by the characters, even at 1,500 yards.
Indeed, since the brightness of the fire is so different from the
surrounding darkness, the light would be noticeable at even greater
ranges, though details wouldn't be. Unless characters using a light
source take special measures (posting a guard in the darkness, for
example), they cannot surprise creatures who can see the light of
their fire, torch, or lantern.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Light sources, particularly
fires, tend either to attract or chase away creatures. Wild animals
tend to avoid lights and fires, especially if hunters frequent the
area. On the other hand, animals that hunt player characters (or
horse meat) will be attracted to a fire. They have learned that fires
signal a source of food.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Intelligent creatures always
approach a light source with caution. Friendly NPCs don't know if
they are approaching the camp of a friend or foe. Hostile NPCs will
likewise get as close as they can without revealing themselves, in
order to learn the strength and numbers of the enemy. Only a few
NPCs—those wishing to avoid all danger—flee at the sight of a
fire, generally heading away from it in the opposite direction.</font></p>

Tricks and Traps</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes a fire or light
source can be used by intelligent creatures as a diversion or trap.
One trick is to build a fire and then set up camp away from it. The
fire attracts whatever is likely to show up in the area, allowing the
characters the chance to ambush the unwary. This is a favorite tactic
of many evil and warlike races such as orcs, bugbears, goblins, and
bandits. It is also a trick used by adventurers to lure monsters away
from their real camp, although this is somewhat dangerous.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Since fires are often used to
determine the size and possible strength of an enemy, dull-witted
creatures and nervous player characters can be frightened away by
building a large number of campfires in an area. The enemy, counting
these fires, decides there is a huge force camping here for the night
and becomes frightened enough to leave. In reality, each fire might
have but a single man or orc tending it.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although the radius of a
light source is the limit a character can effectively see using that
source, it is not the absolute limit. The light doesn't just end
there as if it had hit a brick wall. Beyond the radius of the light,
there will still be flickering shadows, reflected eyes, and perhaps
glints of metal. Now, some of these may be nothing more than the
overactive imaginations of the player characters; others may be real
threats! The DM can use this unknown factor as a tool to build
suspense in his game.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are two definitions of
infravision that can be used in the AD&amp;D game. The first is
simple but lacks detail. It is, however, a perfectly adequate
definition for those who don't want to bother with the complexities
of infravision. The second, optional, definition, adds another level
of detail to the game. It allows the DM to create special situations
in which the function of infravision becomes important, but requires
the DM to keep track of more rules and more details.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Standard
Infravision</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The easiest definition of
infravision is that it allows characters to see in the dark. Nothing
more is said about how this works—it simply works. Characters do
not see into the infared spectrum or &quot;see'' heat or anything
else. They just see in the dark as clearly as they do in normal
light. However, since it is a somewhat magical power, the range is
not that of normal vision—infravision ability extends only 60 feet.
Beyond this only normal vision is allowed.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Optional
Infravision</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This definition is much more
scientific and accurate to what we know of physical properties of the
real world. To its advantage, this definition makes infravision very
different from normal sight, with its own strengths and weaknesses.
To its disadvantage, it introduces a certain amount of scientific
accuracy (with all its complications) into a fantasy realm.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	According to this definition,
infravision is the ability to sense or &quot;see'' heat. The best
comparison is to thermal imaging equipment used by the armed forces
of many different nations today. This special sense is limited to a
60-foot range. Within this range, characters can see the degrees of
heat radiated by an object as a glowing blob translated into colors
like a thermagram.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If this definition is used,
there are several things that must be considered. First, large heat
sources will temporarily blind characters with infravision just as
looking at a bright light blinds those with normal vision. Thus,
those attempting to use infravision must make the effort to avoid
looking directly at fires or torches, either their own or the
enemy's. (The light from magical items does not radiate significant
heat.) Second, the DM must be ready to state how hot various things
are. A literal interpretation of the rule means that characters won't
be able to tell the floor from the walls in most dungeons. All of it
is the same temperature, after all.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The DM must also be ready to
decide if dungeon doors are a different temperature (or radiate heat
differently) from stone walls. Does a different color or kind of
stone radiate heat differently from those around it? Does the ink of
a page radiate differently enough from the paper to be noticed?
Probably not. Can a character tell an orc from a hobgoblin or a
human? Most creatures have similar &quot;thermal outlines&quot;—somewhat
fuzzy blobs. They do not radiate at different temperatures and even
if they did, infravision is seldom so acute as to register
differences of just a few degrees.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Be sure you understand the
effects this optional definition of infravision can have—there are
dangers in bringing scientific accuracy to a fantasy game. By
creating a specific definition of how this power works, the DM is
inviting his players to apply logic to the definition. The problem
is, this is a fantasy game and logic isn't always sensible or even
desired! So, be aware that the optional definition may result in very
strange situations, all because logic and science are applied to
something that isn't logical or scientific.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the optional definition of
infravision is used, the DM has set a precedent for using scientific
laws to explain the ability. Some people, arguing that there are
visual organs that can apparently see into the infrared spectrum
(using infravision), will also argue for other forms of sight able to
see into other ranges of the spectrum. These can be included, if the
DM desires. However, before adding these to his game, the DM had best
have a firm grasp of the rules and, maybe, of physics.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, just what would
a character or creature with ultravision (the ability to see into the
ultraviolet spectrum) see? Our eyes see objects because of visible
light that is </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>reflected</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
off objects (except for a few objects, such as the sun, light bulbs,
fires, etc., that emit enough visible light for us to see them).
Infravision utilizes heat (infrared) energy </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>emitted</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
by objects, since almost everything emits infrared energy. The
problem with infravision is that many objects, such as normal weapons
and rocks, without internal heat sources, are at or very near the
temperature of their surrounding and thus are nearly
indistinguishable from those surroundings when using infravision.
Ultravision (and vision utilizing x-rays, gamma rays, or radio waves)
is useless since only stars and a few other celestial objects emit
significant amounts of energy in these regions of the electromagnetic
spectrum. All wold appear uniformly black with these forms of vision,
except for a few objects in the sky.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sooner or later characters
wind up blundering around in the dark. Normally they try to avoid
this, but clever DMs and foolish players generally manage to bring it
about. Perhaps the kobolds captured the player characters an stripped
them of all their gear; perhaps the characters forgot to bring enough
torches. Whatever the reason, those without infravision suffer both
physical and psychological effects in the dark.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For the purposes of this
discussion, &quot;darkness'' means any time the characters suffer
from limited visibility. Thus, the rules given here apply equally
well when the characters are affected by a darkness spell, blundering
about in pea-soup fog, out on a moonless night, or even blindfolded.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Since one can't see anything
in the dark, the safe movement rate of blinded characters is
immediately slowed by 1/3 the normal amount. Faster movement requires
a Dexterity check (see Chapter 14: Time and Movement). Characters
also suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls and saving throws. Their
Armor Class is four worse than normal (to a limit of 10).
Sight-related damage bonuses (backstabbing, etc.) are negated.

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Invisibility is a highly
useful tool for both player characters and DMs. Handled well, it can
create surprises and unexpected encounters. However, invisibility
requires careful judgment on the part of the DM, lest situations
occur that could unbalance a scenario or campaign.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	First, an invisible creature
is invisible to everyone, including itself. This is normally not a
great difficulty; most creatures are aware of their own bodies and
don't need to see their feet to walk, etc. However, when attempting
detailed actions (for example, picking a lock or threading a needle),
invisible characters have serious problems, suffering a -3 (or -15%)
penalty to their chance of success. This does not apply to
spellcasting.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Second, invisible characters
are invisible to friend and foe. Unless care is exercised, it is easy
for a visible person to blunder into an invisible companion. Imagine
a fighter swinging his sword just as he realizes he doesn't know
where good old invisible Merin is standing! The problem is even worse
with a group of invisible characters—characters crash and tumble
(invisibly) into one another, all because nobody can see anybody. It
would be like having a roomful of people play
pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey all at once!</font></p>

<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Detecting
Invisible Creatures</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Invisible creatures and
things are not detectable by normal sight or by infravision. They do
not create any significant distortion or haze pattern that can be
noted. However, invisible creatures aren't completely undetectable.
First, things still cling to them. Flour thrown into the air is
useful for this purpose, although it can be easily covered, washed
off, or brushed away. Second, they do not leave invisible footprints.
Again, flour on the floor is a good way to spot the movement of
invisible creatures.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The effects of specific
environments are more subtle. Fog and smoke do not reveal invisible
creatures. Smoke and fog are filled with swirls and eddies,
preventing the creature from being detected. Invisible creatures
completely submerged in liquids are also concealed; there is no
hollow space or &quot;air bubble'' to reveal the creature's presence.
At the surface, an invisible swimmer may be noticed by the observant
as an unusual distortion of the waves.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Invisible creatures are not
automatically silent. An invisible fighter in plate mail still clanks
and rattles as he moves, a dead giveaway to most creatures. They
still have scent, so creatures with keen noses can smell them.
Indeed, blind, or nearly blind, creatures are unaffected by
invisibility.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>detect
magic</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> shows only
the presence of something magical without pinpointing it exactly.
Thus, it cannot be used as a substitute for a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>detect
invisible</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell.
Furthermore, while an actual light source may be invisible, the light
emanating from it is not. This can reveal the location of an
invisible character.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When the DM thinks there is
minor but sufficient cause for a creature to detect an invisible
character, a saving throw vs. spell should be made (secretly if the
DM is checking for a player character). A minor cause might be a
strange odor, small noise, an object that disappeared when it
shouldn't have, or a strange reaction from another person (who has
been pushed, kicked, poked, etc., by the invisible character). Such a
saving throw should be allowed for each new event. A wolf would get a
save when it detected a strange scent, then shortly after when it
heard a stick break, and finally a last chance when the character
drew his sword from his scabbard. Furthermore, the acuity of the
creature's senses and its general intelligence can increase or
decrease the frequency of checks, at the DM's discretion.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the suspicious creature or
character rolls a successful saving throw, he detects some small sign
of the invisible foe's presence. He knows its general location, but
not its exact position. He can attack it with a -4 penalty on his
chance to hit. If the check fails, the creature or character is
unaware of the invisible opponent until it does something else that
might reveal its presence.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of course, a revealing action
(which could range from an attack to tripping over a pile of pots)
immediately negates the need for a saving throw. In such cases, the
character has a pretty good idea that something is not right and can
take actions to deal with the situation.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, even if an invisible
character is suspected, this does not mean the character will be
instantly attacked. The result, especially for less intelligent
creatures, may only be increased caution. Having scented the
intruder, the wolf bristles and growls, protecting its cubs. The
rattlesnake will give its warning rattle. Even the orcs may only
circle about warily, alert for an ambush.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The passage of time in an AD&amp;D
campaign can have relatively minor or extremely significant effects
on the play of the game. The importance of time is decided almost
entirely by the DM. Some DMs care very little about strict
timekeeping; others track every moment of action, using a rigid
calendar. Either method is acceptable and each has its advantages and
disadvantages. The two can even be combined, as appropriate to the
situation.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Regardless of how time is
handled, some timekeeping is unavoidable: Combats must be fought in
rounds; spells have specific durations which become important as
characters explore caverns and ancient ruins; days are used to
measure overland travel; characters must sleep sometime.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, most passing time
occurs within a single adventure: Spells rarely carry over from
adventure to adventure (unless the session is stopped with the
characters lost in winding caverns or the like); rounds of combat,
while taking several game minutes, don't affect or spill over into
subsequent adventures; days of travel often have no effect other than
healing and the consumption of supplies.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the DM wants, this is the
only sort of timekeeping required. Time passed in previous adventures
has little or no effect on the current session—each session or
adventure is distinct and separate. For example, in one adventure,
the characters spend a few hours in the dungeon, get injured, have
some success, and return wounded. The night's game session ends with
them returning to their home base. Next game session, the DM
announces, &quot;A week or so has passed since you last went out.
Everybody is healed and rested. People with spells can pick new
ones.&quot; The DM has chosen not to worry about the passage of time
in this instance. An entire campaign can be played this way.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Here's another example: In
one adventure, a group of characters travels for three weeks and has
several encounters, ending camped outside some ruins. The next
session starts after the characters have camped for five days, so
they can heal their wounds. Several hours pass as they explore the
ruins, but no one is particularly hurt when they return to camp, and
the game session ends.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The next session starts the
morning after their previous adventure, everyone having gotten a good
rest. The characters set out again. They spend a week on the road and
arrive at a village. Here, the mage insists everyone wait while he
researches a vital spell. Again, the game session ends. The next
session begins two months later, after the mage has learned his spell
and continues from there. Throughout all this, the DM is more or less
winging it, estimating the time required and time spent.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There is nothing wrong with
this method, nor is it particularly unrealistic. Medieval travelers
often stopped at friendly or safe heavens for long periods while on
their way to a final destination. There was little pressure to hurry.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Using this simple
time-tracking approach frees the DM from many of the concerns of
timekeeping and prevents some obstacles to the adventure from
occurring. (&quot;We can't go on an adventure! We're all hacked up
and have to heal.&quot;) Most of all, it is easy.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

Timekeeping</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As noted, however, there are
disadvantages to such simple time-tracking. Problems become more
pronounced as the characters advance in level, your campaign world
becomes larger, and more players take part in your game.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At low levels, characters
tend to go on short adventures. A few hours in the dungeon followed
by a speedy return is about all they can survive. Therefore, it is
easy to have a week's interval within adventures, since the time
passed does not impact on the characters' activities. As characters
reach higher levels, however, their ambitions grow and their
adventures become longer. More precise time-tracking proves useful.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	More precise methods can
become unworkable, however, when player characters split into small
groups, undertaking separate, simultaneous adventures. If one group
sets out on a long journey while the rest of the party stays in the
city, their game sessions are going to be at very different time
scales.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In their first session, the
city dwellers may go on a short dungeon expedition. Several hours of
game time (the amount of imaginary time spent on the adventure) pass.
The DM then has a session with the travelers, and they spend three
weeks of game time in the wilderness during their game. There is now
a game time difference between the two groups of three weeks minus
one day!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the travelers return to
the city at the end of their adventure, the group in town must
suddenly be moved forward in time to catch up with them if both
groups wish to adventure together. Fortunately, this is not a great
problem. The DM can simply say, &quot;Three weeks have passed and you
are all reunited again.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The city adventurers can
spend those three weeks doing background work—training, researching
spells, making a minor magic item, building a house, etc. This is a
good use of free time. However, if one of the city characters decides
to join the travellers (perhaps using a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>teleport</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell to catch up with them suddenly), the three-week difference
becomes a problem. Was that character actually with the traveling
group for three weeks without doing anything? Must he wait for three
weeks before he can join them? What if the other characters in town
want to adventure more during that time? At this point, keeping track
of time (or having the players do it) becomes pretty important.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One advantage of careful
timekeeping is the detail and flavor it adds to the DM's campaign. If
a calendar is kept, the DM has a way of recording the passing
seasons, holidays, months, cycles of the moon, or other details that
give a world life.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Clerics have holy days to
observe, werewolves become more prevalent near full moons, snows
come, and birds fly south. All of these are events that happen during
the course of a year and make a world seem more real. Without some
type of calendar, the DM has nothing to base his campaign on. Take,
for example, the following exchange between players:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Jon (Johan the Cleric's
player): &quot;Say, you know I'm a member of this temple. Do I have
to do anything, or what? Do I give a sermon every week or are there
some days of fasting or anything?&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	DM: &quot;Well, uh,
yeah—you've got holy days you're supposed to spend in prayer.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Jon: &quot;Oh, when?&quot;</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Preparing a calendar does
take time. The easiest method is to buy a small pocket calendar for
the current year. Start the campaign on the same date as the first
adventure. Thus, if the first game is played on April 3rd, the
campaign starts on that day. The real calendar and game calendar will
get out of sync quickly, but at least there will be a record of
seasons, moons, and important dates.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This is a good starting
point, but a modern calendar is not the same as that used in medieval
times and certainly not the same as one used for a fantasy world.
You'll want to customize your calendar with details from your game
world. So, what types of details should be included?</font></p>

on). Have fun.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Medieval calendars observed
over 100 different holy days for saints or special events. Create
your own such calendar, being sure to add special observances

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, remember that time
can be used quite effectively to balance a campaign. With it, a DM
can prevent an adventuring party from achieving too wide a spread of
character levels. If one character is advancing faster than the
others, that person's progress can be slowed a little by carefully
enforcing the rules for researching, training, and healing. If
several people are outpacing the rest of the group, they can be
required to go on longer adventures, ones that take more game time
(but not playing time) to complete.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the same time, characters
who are lagging in level can have time restrictions relaxed a little.
The day-to-day drudgeries go a little quicker for these characters,
and their adventures require shorter amounts of game time. This will
allow them to undertake several adventures to the other group's one
or two, giving the lower level characters a chance to catch up.</font></p>

Overland Movement</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Mounted movement
cross-country is affected by a number of factors. The two principal
ones are the movement rate of the mount and the type of terrain
traversed. Under normal conditions, all mounts are able to move a
number of miles per day equal to their movement rate. Terrain, such
as roads or mountains, can alter this rate.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Advantages
of Mounted Movement</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When determining overland
movement rates, remember that most riders spend as much time walking
their mounts as they do riding them. The real advantage of riding is
in the extra gear the mount can carry and its usefulness in combat.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Thus, while an unencumbered
man can go about the same distance as a heavy warhorse across clear
terrain (24 miles as opposed to 30), the man must travel with
virtually no gear to move at that rate. Were he to carry an
assortment of arms, a suit of chain mail armor, and his personal
items, he would find it impossible to keep up with a mounted man
similarly encumbered.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Increasing
Overland Speed</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A mount can be pushed to
double its normal daily movement rate, but only at the risk of
lameness and exhaustion. Any creature moving overland at double speed
(or any fraction thereof) must make a saving throw vs. death.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the saving throw is
successful, the creature is unaffected. If the saving throw is
failed, the creature is lame or spent; it can't travel any farther
that day. Thereafter, it can move only at its normal movement rate
until it is rested for at least one day. For each successive day a
horse is ridden at double movement, a -1 penalty is applied to the
saving throw.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Overland movement can be
increased to triple the normal rate, although the risks to the animal
are even greater. When moving at triple the normal rate, a saving
throw vs. death must be made with a -3 penalty applied to the die
roll. If the saving throw is failed, the creature collapses from
exhaustion and dies. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature is
merely spent and must be rested—not ridden at all—for 1d3 days.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a creature goes lame,
exhausts itself, or is ridden too hard, there is no way of knowing
just when the creature will collapse. Player characters can't be
certain of traveling the full double or triple distance. The DM
should determine where and when the creature collapses. This can be a
random place or at some point the DM thinks is best for the
adventure.</font></p>

<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although player characters
should not be forced into the role of grooms, all animals do have
some basic needs that must be provided for. However, each animal is
different, so the requirements for each are listed separately.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Horses:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">While strong and
fast, horses are not the hardiest creatures for traveling. Horses
need around ten pounds of forage and fodder a day. Furthermore, good
quality mounts should be fed grain, such as oats. A heavy war horse
can't survive the rigors of travel by grazing on grass. Characters
who can't provide enough food of high enough quality will watch their
horses weaken and die. Horses must also have water every day. This
can become particularly difficult in the desert.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	During daily travel, horses
must be allowed to stop and rest with regular frequency. During these
stops the mount should be unsaddled or all packs removed. If this
isn't done, little profit is gained from the rest. At night horses
should be hobbled or tethered on a long rope so they can graze. If
one or two are tied, the others will generally not wander off. Horses
need not be shod, unless they walk mostly on hard-surfaced roads or
rocky ground. Horseshoes should be replaced about once a month.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Ponies,
Donkeys, and Mules:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">These animals
have much the same needs as the horse. One of their main advantages
is their ability to survive by grazing. Well accustomed to grass,
there is no need to provide them with separate fodder. Their
happiness is such that saving throws vs. death made for double
movement gain a +2 bonus. This does not apply to triple movement.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The other great advantage of
these creatures is their sure-footedness. They can travel through
rugged terrain at one less than the normal movement cost. Thus, low
mountains cost only three movement points.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Camels:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Camels are
either suited to sandy deserts (as in the case of the dromedary) or
rocky deserts (the bactrian camel). It's worth nothing that
dromedaries are ill-suited to rocky deserts, and bactrian camels
aren't appropriate mounts in sandy deserts! Dromedary camels reduce
the movement cost of sandy desert by 1 point. Bactrian camels have
the same effect in rocky deserts.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All camels march better by
night, when it is cooler. Dromedary camels are able to withstand a
few days of cold weather (the temperature drops drastically in the
desert at night); and some bactrian camels actually live in freezing
and mountainous deserts.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although camels can manage
for long periods of time without water, they must be fed every day.
They do not need special fodder so long as grazing is possible. On
the average they should have water at least every four days, although
they can be trained to do without for longer periods, even up to
several months if green grass or leaves are available for grazing.
Like horses, camels should be hobbled or tethered to prevent them
from wandering off.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Dogs:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Particularly
tough breeds can be used to pull sleds and sledges. Some are suited
to cold weather and will withstand a great deal of hardship. They
require at least a pound of meat a day, so characters should pack
dried meat for the dogs. If necessary, one dog can be killed to feed
the others, but this is not recommended. Beyond the needs of feeding,
sled dogs tend to care for themselves fairly well, although the
characters may have to keep certain animals separated to prevent
fighting.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">As can be
expected, elephants eat a prodigious amount of fodder every day. In
thickly forested areas, this can be supplied without reducing the
beasts' already slow speed. Elephants can also be found in sparsely
forested plains, though. Here, if left to graze for itself, the beast
will move at ¼ its normal movement rate. Except for the carrying
capacity of the beast, the characters might as well walk at these
speeds! Elephants should bathe (or be bathed) every day and will
avail themselves of dust baths to keep biting flies away.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It should also come as no
surprise that elephants can't negotiate cliffs. They can bound down
steep slopes—indeed, it is the only time they go fast—but only at
great peril to themselves and their riders. If the beast fails a
saving throw vs. breath weapon (used for general tests of dexterity),
it stumbles, falls, and rolls the rest of the way down the slope. The
fall may kill or severely injure the elephant; the choice is left to
the DM. Elephants are affected only by the deepest mud, so the
movement penalty for mud is ignored.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Yaks are suited
to the cold regions of high mountains. While slow, they are sturdy,
unaffected by the cold. Their sure footing allows them to reduce all
mountain movement rates by one. They can survive by grazing on a
meagre amount of grass. Yaks also provide meat and milk for
travelers. They live in cool regions and cannot survive long in
warmer climates since they are prone to collapse from heat
exhaustion.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	While animals are useful for
getting around in the wilderness, they are seriously limited by the
size of the load they can carry. Peasants and merchants often use
wagons and carts for trade in civilized areas. Chariots are favored
by the wealthy and in times of war, but are not normally used for
long-distance travel. Sledges and dog sleds are handy in snow and
ice-bound regions. Player characters may find all these vehicles
necessary during the course of their adventures.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Carts</b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">

animals, but no more than this. </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Wagons</b></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
are four-wheeled and can hitch anywhere from two to 12 (or even
more!).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The movement rate of a horse
or other animal is automatically reduced by half when hitched.
Additional animals do not increase the speed. However, the standard
load the beast can carry is tripled. The weight of the cart or wagon
and driver is not considered for this, only the cargo. Each
additional animal adds its tripled capacity to the total load hauled.
Thus, a wagon pulled by eight draft horses could carry 6,420 lbs., or
slightly over three tons worth of cargo (260 x 3 x 8). Of course,
traveling will be slow—only 12 miles a day on a level road.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Chariots</b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
are intended more for speed, comfort, and their usefulness in
warfare, than for their ability to haul loads. Chariots can hitch one
to four horses (or other creatures), but no more than this. A horse
can pull its normal load (the weight of the chariot not included) at 
    its normal movement rate.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Each additional horse in the
hitch either increases the cargo limit by the horse's standard load
or increases the movement rate by a factor of 1. The chariot can't
have more movement points than the creatures pulling it would
normally have. A chariot pulled by four medium war horses could have
a movement rate of 15 or pull 880 lbs., enough for four large or
armored men. It could also have some combination of the two (movement
rate of 13 and a cargo of 660 in the above example).</font></p>

and Vehicles</b></font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The greatest limitation on
all these vehicles is terrain. Wagons, carts, and chariots are
restricted to level or open ground unless traveling on a road or the
best trails. While a wagon can cross a mountain range by staying to
the open valleys and passes, it just can't make good progress in a
thick forest. This problem generally restricts wagons to travel
between settlements, where roads and paths are common.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sledges and dog sleds can be
used only in snow-covered or ice-coated lands. Sledges (pulled by
horses or the like) are roughly equivalent to carts. No more than two
horses can be hooked to a sledge. Horse-drawn sledges are effective
only on hard-packed snows and ice and can ignore the penalties for
these. Deep snow merely causes the horse to flounder and the runners
of the sledge to sink, so no benefit is gained in these conditions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Dog sleds are normally pulled
by seven to 11 dogs. When hitched, a sled dog's movement is reduced
by ½. However, each additional dog adds one movement factor to the
sledge, up to the maximum of movement of the animal. Thus a dog sled
with seven dogs would have a movement of 13½. Each dog can pull 80
lbs., not including the weight of the sledge. Due to their lighter
weight and the sledge design, dog sleds can cross all types of snow
and ice without penalty.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If characters choose to move
more quickly (up to their normal movement rate), they must roll a
Dexterity check each round. If the check is passed, nothing happens.
If the check is failed, the character has tripped over some unseen
obstacle or sprawled out from an unexpected slide.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In perfect darkness the
character can't be certain that he is walking in the right direction
unless he has spells or other assistance. Assuming the character is
on his own, the DM can choose what happens or he can determine
randomly by rolling 1d12. On a 1-4 the character maintains the
desired course. On a 5-8 he veers to the right and on a 9-12 he goes
to the left. The consequences of such course changes depends entirely
on the DM and his map.</font></p>

Modifiers In Overland Movement</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Overland movement is much
more affected by terrain than single-round movement. Thus, a wide
variety of terrain types slow or, on very rare occasions, increases
the character's rate of movement.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Overland movement is measured
in miles. It is possible for characters to cross several different
types of terrain in a single day. To say that characters must take
the worst terrain modifier for all movement is ridiculous. Imagine
telling players they have to travel at the mountain movement rate
when they are crossing the plains just because they spent their first
hour in the mountains!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, in round
movement the DM can see where a character will be at the end of the
round and what terrain he had to cross to get there. In overland
movement, it is very hard to predict all the different terrain types
characters will enter during the course of a day.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Table 74 lists the effects of
different terrain. These are listed as points of movement spent per
mile of travel through that terrain type. When a character or
creature moves through the listed terrain, that number is subtracted
from the total movement available to the character or creature that
day.</font></p>

and Trails</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The main purpose of roads and
trails is to provide a clear route for wagons, carts, and other forms
of heavy transport. It is impossible for such vehicles to cross any
terrain that has a movement point cost greater than 1 unless they are
following a road or trail. In addition, roads and trails normally go
somewhere, so it is hard (but not impossible) for characters to get
lost while following them.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Trails</b></font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
are by far the most common cleared track found in AD&amp;D game
worlds. Often little more than narrow game trails, they are the
natural result of traffic moving from one point to another. Though
not roads (in that they are not maintained), they tend to be fairly
open pathways. Still, characters may have to see to the removal of
fallen trees and stones or the clearing of brush—all things that
can be accomplished by the occasional traveler.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Trails normally follow the
path of least resistance, avoiding difficult obstacles such as
chasms, cliffs, and unfordable rivers. While this may increase the
distance characters must travel, it usually results in an overall
saving of time and effort.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When traveling along a trail,
the movement point cost is half normal for the terrain type traversed
by the trail. Following a trail through the heavy forest, for example
(movement cost of four), costs only 2 movement points per mile. An
unencumbered man on foot would be able to march 12 miles through such
terrain without exerting himself. Trails through settled farmland
offer no improvement, since these areas are easy to travel through
already.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

are costly to build and maintain, so they were very rare in the
Middle Ages (the general time period of the AD&amp;D game). Only the
largest and best organized empires can undertake such ambitious
construction programs.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In areas of level or rolling
ground, such as forests and plains, roads reduce the movement cost to
one-half point per mile. In areas of mountainous ground, roads are no
better than trails and reduce movement costs accordingly. A road
traveling through high mountains is only four movement points per
mile.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The movement point costs
given above assume the best of conditions even in the worst of
terrain. The mountains are assumed to be free of cliffs; the woods
have no high-banked streams; rains haven't turned the plains to mud;
the tundra hasn't been blanketed in snow. However, poor traveling
conditions do occur, and when they do travel is slowed. Table 75
lists common obstacles and situations that slow movement. The
modifiers for these are listed as either additional movement point
costs or multipliers.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When additional movement
costs are listed, these are added to the cost of the surrounding
terrain. Thus, crossing a ridge in the high mountains costs nine
movement points for that mile instead of the normal eight.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Multipliers increase the
movement cost by the amount listed. Snow, for example, doubles the
cost of crossing the plains. Indeed, severe weather or torrential
rains—can actually bring all travel to a halt.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One of the fastest and
easiest ways to get somewhere is to travel on a river. It's hard to
get lost; a large amount of equipment can be easily carried; it is
faster and easier than walking; characters can even do other things
(mend clothes, learn spells, cook meals) while traveling on smooth
waters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	River travel is not without
its risks, however. Eddies, snags, sandbars, rapids, and dangerous
waterfalls can make a journey quite exciting. Fortunately, most of
these hazards can be avoided by knowledgeable characters.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The rate of movement on a
river is determined by two factors: the type of boat and the flow of
the current. If the boat is traveling downstream (in the direction of
the current), add the speed of the current to the speed of the boat.
If the boat is traveling against the current, subtract this amount
from the boat's speed. Table 76 lists rates in both feet/round and
miles/hour for the common types of riverboats.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When sailing downstream,
characters must be wary of unexpected hazards. While a good map can
show the location of waterfalls and rapids, only a knowledgeable
guide or pilot knows the location of hidden sandbars, snags, and
dangerous eddies. While these are easy to avoid when traveling
upstream (all one need do is stop paddling), unprepared boaters can
quickly be swept into them going downstream.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once characters find
themselves in a dangerous situation, they must make    a Wisdom
check (modified for seamanship proficiency, if this is used) to
prevent capsizing. Capsized boats and goods are swept downstream,
although hazards like waterfalls and particularly strong rapids will
smash most craft.</font></p>

Voyaging</font></font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Ocean journeys are a
dangerous business, especially in a fantasy world. Sea serpents,
incredible maelstroms, and other imaginary horrors that filled the
maps of medieval navigators really can lurk in the deeps of the AD&amp;D
game's oceans. Not that they are really necessary—pirates, storms,
hidden shoals, and primitive navigational techniques leave the
typical sea captain with more than enough danger to cope with.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Deep-sea sailing is pretty
much unknown in the AD&amp;D game world. The majority of captains
prefer to stay close to known coasts. Without navigation equipment
only a few ships venture into open water beyond the sight of land.
Ship-building skills are not fully up to the needs of deep-sea
sailing. Most ships are easily swamped by the stormy waters of major
oceans, while their small size prevents crews from carrying adequate
supplies for long voyages. Even the skills of sail-handling are in
their rudimentary stages.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, these limitations
are not serious in a fantasy world. Those with wealth can cross
oceans by other, more practical, means: flying mounts, undersea
dwellers, and teleportation are all available, at least to the rich
and powerful. (The vast majority of the population does not have
access to these forms of travel.) Also, magical transport is
impractical for moving large cargoes. The need to move goods and the
scarcity of magical transport make sailing a valuable and necessary
art.</font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Aerial movement rates are
handled according to the normal movement rules, with clear sky being
treated as clear terrain. A detailed system of aerial movement during
the round can be found in Chapter 9: Combat. The only special
consideration that must be given to aerial movement is the weather
condition. Weather is, for al practical purposes, the terrain of the
sky.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As with sea movement, the
weather for any particular occasion can be chosen by the DM or
determined randomly. If determined randomly, the DM should first roll
a wind condition (as found on Table 79, above).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Next, the DM rolls 1d6 to
determine precipitation (although storms and hurricanes have
automatic precipitation). During summer and winter, a 6 on the die
indicates rain or snow. In spring and fall, a 5 or 6 is rain. Clearly
the DM must adjust this according to the terrain of the region. There
is little need to make precipitation checks when flying over a
desert, for example.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Be aware that this is only a
very simple method for determining the weather, and judgment should
still be used. The effects of weather on aerial movement can be found
on Table 80.</font></p>

Lost</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Monsters, bandits, evil
wizards, and villainous knights can all make travel in the wilderness
dangerous. But none of these is the greatest hazard characters will
have to face. Getting lost is equally dangerous and far more common.
Once characters are lost, almost anything can happen.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There are two ways of getting
lost: There's just lost and then there's hopelessly lost. Each is
quite different from the other.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Just
Lost</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Sometimes, characters are
lost because they do not know how to get to a specific place. They
know where they have been (and how to get back there), but they don't
know the correct route to reach their goal. This occurs most often
when following a road, a trail, a map, a river, or a set of
directions.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Under these circumstances,
there is a reasonable certainty that the player characters will wind
up somewhere. After all, roads go from place to place and rivers
start and end somewhere. Whether this is where the player characters
want to go is another matter entirely. No particular rules are needed
to handle these situations, only some confusing forks in the road and
the wit (or lack thereof) of the players.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, imagine the
characters following a well-marked trail. Rounding the corner, they
find the trail splits into two equally used trails. The directions
they got in the last village said nothing about the trail branching.
They must guess which way is the right way to go. In a sense, they
are now lost. Once they choose a trail, they do not know if their
guess was correct until they get to the end. But, they can always
find their way back to the last village. So they are not hopelessly
lost. This can also happen when following rivers, roads, or blaze
markings.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Hopelessly
Lost</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Hopelessly lost is another
matter altogether. This happens when player characters have no idea
where they are, how exactly to get back to where they were, or which
way to go to get to where they want to be.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Although it can happen,
player characters seldom get hopelessly lost when following some
obvious route (a road or river). Trails do not guarantee safety since
they have a maddening habit of disappearing, branching, and crossing
over things that look like they should be trails (but aren't).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The chance of getting
hopelessly lost can be reduced by sighting on a landmark and keeping
a bearing on it, or by hiring a guide. Darkness, overcast days, thick
forests, and featureless wastes or plains all increase the chance of
getting lost.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Checks for getting hopelessly
lost should only be made when the player characters are not following
a clear road, river, or trail. Checks should be made when following a
little-used trail or when a river empties into a swamp, estuary, or
delta. Checks should also be made when moving cross-country without
the aid of a trail, river, or road. One check should be made per day.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To make the check, find the
entry on Table 81 that best matches the type of terrain the
characters are in. This will give a percentage chance to become lost.
From this, add or subtract any modifiers found on Table 82. Roll
percentile dice. If the die roll is less than the percentage, the
characters are lost.</font></p>

With Lost Characters</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once a group is lost, no
further checks need be made—they're lost until they get themselves
back in familiar territory (or until they get lucky and happen upon
someone who can help them out.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Don't tell players when their
characters are lost! Let them continue to think they are headed in
the right direction. Gradually veer them away from their true
direction. Player characters should realize for themselves that
they're no longer heading in the right direction. This generally
comes when they don't get to whatever point they hoped to reach.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, a group of
player characters is following a poor trail through lightly wooded
hills on their way to a village three days' march due west. On the
first day, they sensibly set their sights on a large rock to the west
as their landmark.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Their chance of getting lost
is 15%—40 for being in wooded hills minus 15 because they've got a
landmark minus 10 because they're on a trail (40 - 15 - 10 = 15). The
DM checks to see if they become lost and rolls a 07. They're lost,
but they don't know it!</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The players announce that
their characters are marching to the west (to follow the landmark),
but, unknown to them, the path takes them somewhat southwest. As the
characters get close to their landmark, they sight a new one in a
straight line beyond it. They think they are still headed west, but
their new course is now northwest.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The player characters are
likely to realize that they are off course only when they don't find
the village at the end of three days' marching. At that point, they
don't know just when they got off course and so they are hopelessly
lost.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Remember that the best
defense against getting lost is not to try to go anywhere in
particular. There is little point in checking to see if characters
get lost if they don't have a goal. It is perfectly possible for
characters just to strike out &quot;to see what can be seen.&quot; If
one has no place to be and no concern about ever getting back, one
cannot get lost.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The previous chapters have
presented a lot of rules and covered a lot of ground, but there are
always a few things that don't fit into neat little categories (or
even big categories!). Some of these are situations that arise all
the time during adventures. Others are situations or background facts
you will need only occasionally. These &quot;left-overs,&quot; common

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One of the useful tricks that
smart adventurers learn after a few trips into deadly dungeons is to
pay attention and listen for strange noises. Noise is a valuable
clue, alerting characters to possible danger and even occasionally
giving them a definite picture of what dangers they face. After
rashly bashing down a door only to discover a barracks full of unruly
orcs, the player characters may find it more prudent to stop outside
and listen before trying the same stunt again.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All characters have a
percentage chance to hear noises, the percentage varying by race, as
listed on Table 83. This ability is equal to that of a 1st-level
thief (however, thieves can choose to increase this score). This is
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>not</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
the character's chance to hear someone talking to him or the tolling
of the city watch's bell at night. This percentage should be used
only when hearing is difficult or there are extraordinary
circumstances involved.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The percentage chance is
followed by a number in parentheses. The second number is the same
chance on 1d20. You can either make a percentile check or roll 1d20,
whichever is most convenient. In either case, a roll equal to or less
than the number on the table means the character hears something.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of course, the chance to hear
noise given above represents more or less optimum conditions—helmet
off, not moving, and all others remaining relatively still for one
round while the character stands and tries to hear noises carried on
the breeze or down a hallway. Under such conditions, the character
will get a relatively clear idea of the nature of the noise—animal
grunts, slithering, speech (including language and race), and perhaps
even words.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Less than perfect conditions
don't alter the chance to hear (which is low enough) but can affect
the clarity. Some, like the muffling effect of doors or the echoing
of stone passages, may still allow the character to hear a noise
reasonably well, but may prevent precise identification.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In some situations, a
character can hear muttering, growls, panting, or voices, but may be
unable to identify the issuer of the sounds. The character would know
there is something ahead, but wouldn't know what. In other
situations, the chance to hear anything at all may be affected.
Extreme cases can give you the excuse to provide misinformation.
Guttural speech may sound like growls, the moaning wind could become
a scream, etc.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In some cases a check is
necessary even when the character is not attempting to discern some
unknown noise. The character tries to hear the shouted words of a
pirate captain over the raging storm. He can see the captain and can
clearly tell the man is speaking. Indeed, the captain may even be
speaking to him. However, a hearing check should be made to find out
if the character can make out the captain's words over the fury of
the storm. If the character were a little closer, the storm a little
less, or the captain's lungs exceptionally strong, the character's
chance of success would be increased.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In all cases, hearing a noise
takes time. The amount of time spent listening to the captain is
obviously the time it takes him to speak his peace. Standing and
hearing noise in a corridor or at a door requires a round, with the
entire party remaining still.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, a character can
make repeated checks in hopes of hearing more or gaining more
information. However, once a character fails a check, he will not
hear anything (even if he immediately makes a successful check on the
next round) unless there is a substantial improvement in the
conditions. The group will have to move closer, open the door, or
take some other action to allow a new check.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a check is successful, the
character can keep listening to learn more. This requires continued
checks, during which the player can attempt to discern
specifies—number, race, nature of beast, direction, approaching or
retreating, and perhaps even bits of conversation. The player states
what he is trying to learn and a check is made.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Trying to overhear things
this way is less than reliable. Thieves should not be allowed to use
their hear-noise ability like super-sensitive microphones!</font></p>

<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Doors</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When creating their
characters, all players come up with a number to open doors, based on
their Strength. Must the characters make checks to see if they can
open inn doors, the doors to their rooms, or a carriage door? Of
course not. Under most circumstances, don't worry about the chance to
open a door. Sometimes, however, there are doors the characters
aren't meant to open. That's when the check becomes important.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Doors can generally be
divided into different groups. First are regular normal doors. These
open when pushed or pulled because that's what they are supposed to
do. The DM who requires a check every time the characters try to
enter a tavern is misinterpreting the rules.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The next group are those
heavy, old, musty, swollen and rusted doors found in dungeons and
ancient ruins. These don't open with an easy pull. The hinges may be
frozen or the wood swollen in the frame. To open these the characters
must make a check, yanking on the handle or giving the door a good
shove.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Finally, there are locked,
barred, and ensorcelled doors, ones that are closed and sealed on
purpose. These take a bit of doing to open.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Every character has a chance
to force open a door, but it is up to the DM to determine when it is
appropriate to use this ability. The DM can legitimately allow the
characters to force open a door held shut by a flimsy lock or rotted
bar. An extremely heavy dungeon door, swollen in its frame may be
unforceable. The characters throw their shoulders against it and just
bounce. If picking a lock is particularly important to the adventure,
then that might be the only way to open the door (short of stealing a
key).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	One important note to
remember is that if a monster opened a door and fled through it, the
characters should be able to open the door with equal ease. The key
here is &quot;equal ease.&quot; What is easy for a troll or hill
giant may be quite a bit more than a gnome or halfling can manage!
Frequent opening and closing will also affect the ease with which a
door can be used.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a door fails to open on
the first attempt, a character can try again—there is no limit to
the number of attempts, but each subsequent attempt will reduce the
character's chance of success by one, as he grows more and more tired
of yanking or banging on the door.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Another common tactic players
use to deal with uncooperative doors is to put multiple characters on
it. Up to two people can attempt to force open a door at the same
time (more than this and the characters tend to trip over
themselves). The chance of opening the door is increased by half the
lesser character's chance (with fractions rounded up). Thus, if
Rupert opens doors on a 1, 2, 3, or 4 (on 1d20) and Delsenora on a 1,
2, or 3, together they can open a door on a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6
(Rupert's 1-4 plus half of Delsenora's 1-3, rounded up to a +2
bonus).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Resourceful characters
sometimes go after doors in a big way, improvising battering rams to
bash them in. The characters need a suitable ram (a stout log will
do) and some running room to gain the full advantage of this method.
Such a ram will enable the characters to total their chances to open
the door. Even without the running room, the characters can swing the
ram into the door. This allows more than two characters to apply
their muscle at one time.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Each character on the ram
contributes one-half his normal chance of opening doors to the
overall effort. Thus, Rupert (1-4), Delsenora (1-3), Tarus (opens
doors 1-6) and Joinville (opens doors 1-2) would have a (2 + 2 + 3 +
1 =) 1-8 chance of bashing down the door swinging a ram into it.
Their chance would be (4 + 3 + 6 + 2 =) 1-15 if they were able to
charge the door full tilt with their ram.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of course, bashing down doors
does have its disadvantages. First, the door is ruined and can't be
closed behind the group. The characters will leave a clear path, one
any pursuers can follow, and they won't be able to block their rear.
Unless the site has regular maintenance, the DM should note on his
key what doors have been destroyed for future references.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Forcing doors open also tends
to be noisy. Unless the door bursts open on the first try, creatures
on the other side cannot be surprised. Even if there isn't anything
behind the door, those nearby will be alerted (and if intelligent,
may take action). Finally, the noise may attract unwanted visitors.
The DM should immediately make a wandering monster check (if any
exist in the area) each time a door is smashed down. Silently picking
locks can have its advantages.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#ff0000"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Concealed
and Secret Doors</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In addition to all other
types of doors, the arcane architects of most fantasy buildings like
to include a few secret and concealed doors. These can range from
simple priest-holes to pivoting bookcases opening into hidden crypts.
The only limit is your imagination.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Secret doors operate
differently from normal doors. First and foremost, they must be
found. This isn't something that happens without effort (if it did,
the door wouldn't be very secret!). With the exception of elves,
characters must search for secret doors to find them.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Searching a 20-foot section
of wall takes about 10 minutes, during which the characters tap,
thump, twist, and poke, looking for secret catches, sliding panels,
hidden levers, and the like. The exact amount of time can vary
according to the amount of detail on the wall. A relatively barren
wall section will go fairly quickly, while one loaded with shelves,
ornamentation, sconces, and other fixtures will require more time. A
character can search a given wall area only once, although several
characters can search the same area.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Normally, when a character
discovers a secret door, he has found the means to open it.
Therefore, no roll must be made to open the door. In very rare cases,
the character may discover that the secret door exists (by finding
its outline, for example) but not know how to open it. In this case,
a separate check must be made to open the door.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Secret doors cannot be forced
open by normal means although they can be bashed down with rams (at
half the normal chance of success). Indeed, it is even possible for
characters to see the secret door in operation and not know how it is
operated. (&quot;You burst in just in time to see Duke Marask, the
vampire, disappear from sight as the sliding bookcase swings back
into position.&quot;) In such cases, knowledge that the door exists
will increase the chance of finding its opening mechanism by 1.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It is a good idea to note how
each particular secret door works and how it is concealed. While such
notes have no effect on the mechanics of the game, they will add a
lot of flavor and mystery at the expense of a little effort. Which is
more exciting—to say, &quot;You find a secret door in the north
wall,&quot; or &quot;You twist the lion-headed ornament over the
mantle and suddenly the flames in the fireplace die down and a panel
in the back slides up?&quot;</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, colorful
descriptions of secret doors allow you to place the burden of
remembering how a given door works on the player characters—&quot;What,
you forgot what to do to make that secret door open? Well, I suppose
you'll have to search again.&quot; If used in moderation, this will
help keep them involved in your game, encouraging them to make maps
filled with all manner of interesting notes.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A concealed door is a normal
door that is purposely hidden from view. There may be a door to the
throne room behind that curtain or a trap door under the rug. The
door isn't disguised in any way or opened by secret catches; it is
just not immediately obvious.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Any search for concealed
doors will reveal them and once found they can be opened normally.
Elves can sometimes sense concealed doors (if they make their die
roll) without having to stop and search. No one knows how this is
accomplished, although some theorize elves notice subtle temperature
gradients when they pass near these doors.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font color="#800080"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Lycanthropy</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Of all the afflictions that
can strike a character, one of the most feared is lycanthropy. While
often considered a disease, lycanthropy can more properly be
described as a natural condition, in some cases, or a curse, in
others. In either case, it is immune to the effects of </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>cure
disease</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spells and
powers. Freeing a character from the torments of lycanthropy is a
more involved and complicated matter than just casting a single
spell.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	True lycanthropy is neither a
curse nor a contagion, but the ability, possessed by a limited number
of species, to change into an animal shape at will. As such, true
lycanthropes are not affected by the phases of the moon, darkness, or
any other limitations on their changing abilities indicated in the
folklore of werewolves. Neither can a PC be afflicted with true
lycanthropy—it is an ability limited to those species born with the
power.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, one of the
characteristics of the true lycanthrope is his ability to transmit a
lycanthropic contagion to his victims. This is the dreaded
lycanthropy of folklore. Once stricken, the victim falls under the
sway of the moon, unable to resist the powerful change into a
bloodthirsty beast.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Whenever a character is
wounded by a true lycanthrope, there is 1% chance per hit point of
damage suffered that the character is stricken with lycanthropy. The
DM makes this check secretly, since characters never learn of their
fate until it is too late (although prudent characters may take
immediate steps as if they had been affected). If stricken, the
character suffers from this curse.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Cursed characters suffer
uncontrollable change on the night of a full moon and the nights
immediately preceding and following it. The change begins when the
moon rises and ends when it sets. During this time the character is
controlled by the DM, not the player. Often, the character discovers
that he has done terrible things while changed and under the DM's
control.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	During the change, the
character's Strength increases temporarily to 19, allowing him to
break bonds, bend bars, and otherwise escape confinement. The changed
character has the Armor Class, attacks, movement, and immunities
identical to the type of lycanthrope that wounded him.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	However, the intelligence and
alignment of the character are overwhelmed by an uncontrollable
bloodlust. The player character must hunt and kill and generally
chooses as his victims people he knows in his daily life. The
stronger the emotion toward the person (either love or hate), the
greater the likelihood the character will attempt to stalk and slay
that person.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Remember that during the
period of the change the player has no control over his character.
Neither will he be identifiable to his friends and companions unless
they are familiar with his curse or can recognize him by some
personal effect.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	At the end of each change,
the character returns to his normal form (perhaps to his
embarrassment). At the same time, he heals 10% to 60% (1d6x10) of any
wounds he has suffered. While the character may know or suspect that
he has done something terrible, he does not have clear memories of
the preceding night. Good characters will be tormented at the thought
of what they may have done, and paladins will find they have, at
least temporarily, fallen from grace.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Freeing a character from the
grip of lycanthropy is not the simple task of casting a spell. A </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>cure
disease</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> has no
effect on the character. A </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>remove
curse</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> allows the
character to make a saving throw to free himself from the
lycanthropy, but this must be cast on one of the nights when the
actual change occurs. If the character makes his saving throw vs.
polymorph, the lycanthropy is broken and will not affect the
character again (unless, of course he is infected by a lycanthrope
once again).</font></p>

we normally understand—germs, mosquitoes, rabid rats, etc. To that

<p class="western" >

property. As such it is not curable by normal means.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	These names are not
necessarily consistent from world to world or Prime Material Plane to
Prime Material Plane. Indeed, since the planes are without dimension
and form, it is possible for different lands in the same campaign
world to have entirely different pictures of planar structure and
order.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, an oriental-type
world might see the Outer Planes not as a series of separate regions,
but as a single mass throughout which are scattered different
agencies of the Celestial Bureaucracy. The Celestial Emperor might
reside on one plane, while his Minister of State operated from
another.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A Nordic land would see the
plane of Ysgard as dominant over all others, in accordance with the
importance they ascribe the powers there. These things are left to
your discretion, as the DM. The planes can be molded to meet the
needs of your campaign.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once the general category is
determined, the DM can choose a specific item from the tables below.
(Each item on the tables is given a die roll number so that the DM
can select items randomly, if he chooses.) Some tables have several
subtables. Each subtable has a range of numbers in parentheses at the
top. To select the appropriate subtable, check the die listed after
the table's title. Roll the listed die and find the result in the
number range at the top of one of the subtables. This is the subtable
you read to determine which item in the list has been found.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	For example, the Potions and
Oils table has &quot;(D6)'' after the title. That means you roll a
6-sided die to determine which Subtable (A, B, or C) to read. If you
roll a 2, for example, you check subtable A (which has &quot;1-2'' at
the top); if you roll a 6, you read subtable C (which has &quot;5-6''
at the top). Roll 1d20 on the appropriate subtable to determine the
specific item found. Then turn to the descriptions following the
tables to find out what each item does.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Potions are typically found
in ceramic, crystal, glass, or metal flasks or vials (though you can
change this, if you want). Flasks or other containers generally
contain enough fluid to provide one person with one complete dose to
achieve the effects described for each potion below.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Opening and drinking a potion
has an initiative modifier of 1, but the potion doesn't take effect
until an additional initiative modifier delay of 1d4+1 has passed.
Only then do the full magical properties of the potion become
evident. Magical oils are poured over the body and smeared
appropriately; this imposes a speed factor delay of 1d4 + 1.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Potions can be compounded by
mages at relatively low cost. However, they must have a sample of the
desired potion to obtain the right formula. Furthermore, ingredients
tend to be rare or hard to come by. This aspect of potions, as well
as the formulation of new ones by players, is detailed in the Spell
Research rules.</font></p>

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	As a general rule, potion
containers should bear no identifying marks, so player characters
must sample from each container to determine the nature of the liquid
inside. However, even a small taste should suffice to identify a
potion in some way. Introduce different sorts of potions, both
helpful and harmful, to cause difficulties in identification. In
addition, the same type of potion, when created in different labs,
might smell, taste, and look differently.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The magical mixtures and
compounds that make up potions are not always compatible. The
compatibility of potions is tested whenever two potions are actually
intermingled, or a potion is consumed by a creature while another
such liquid, already consumed, is in effect.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Permanent potions have an
effective duration of one turn for mixing purposes. If you drink
another potion within one turn of drinking one with Permanent
duration, check on Table 111. The exact effects of combining potions
can't be calculated, because of differences in formulae, fabrication
methods, and component quality employed by various mages. Therefore,
it is suggested that Table 111 be used, with the following
exceptions:</font></p>

a spellbook or read to release its magic, the writing completely and
permanently disappears from the scroll. The magic content of the
spell is bound up in the writing, and use releases and erases it.
Thus, reading a spell from a scroll of seven spells makes the item a
scroll of six spells. No matter what a player may try, each spell on
a scroll is only usable once. Exceptions should be made very rarely
and only when you have a very special magical item in mind—perhaps
a scroll that can be read once per week. This would be potent magic
indeed.</font></p>

special enough to require careful preparation and use by the DM,

rarely be given out randomly—the DM must have a suitable map

All hint at or imply the existence of great treasures to be found
while giving only a vague idea of the risks to be overcome. Some may
be genuine, others fake. Because of the wide range of possibilities,
the DM should use treasure maps as the springboard for new and

leaves the protected area, it is subject to physical attack. The
protection restrains up to 35 Hit Dice/levels of undead; excess Hit
Dice/levels can pass through the circle. It remains in effect for
10d8 rounds. Some protection scrolls of this nature protect only
against certain types of undead (one or more) rather than all undead,

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All magical rings normally
radiate magic, but most are impossible to detect as magical rings
without some mystic means. Furthermore, all magical rings look alike,
so determination of a given ring's magical powers is difficult. The
ring must be put on and various things tried in order to find what it
does. No ring radiates good or evil.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	No more than two magical
rings can be worn by a character at the same time. If more are worn,
none will function. No more than one magical ring can be worn on the
same hand. A second ring worn on one hand causes both to be useless.
Rings must be worn on the fingers. Rings on toes, in ear lobes, etc.,
do not function as magical rings.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The spell-like abilities of
rings function as 12th-level magic unless the power requires a higher
level. In cases where a higher level is necessary, rings function at
the minimum level of magic use needed to cast the equivalent spell.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Magical rings can be worn and
used by all character classes and humans/humanoids not specifically
prohibited elsewhere. You might allow &quot;monsters'' with digits to
wear rings, and some can actually benefit from them. For example, a
troll could wear a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>ring

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">When the wearer
of this ring approaches within 10 feet of any animals of neutral
alignment and animal intelligence, the creatures must roll saving
throws vs. spell. If they succeed, they move rapidly away from the
ring wearer. If the saving throws fail, the creatures become docile
and follow the ring wearer around. The item functions at 6th level,
so up to 12 Hit Dice of animals can be affected by this ring.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Animals feeling friendship
for the wearer will actually guard and protect that individual if he
expends a charge from the ring to cause such behavior. A ring of this
sort typically has 27 charges when discovered, and it cannot be
recharged. A druid wearing this ring can influence twice the
prescribed Hit Dice worth of animals (24 rather than 12), and a
ranger is able to influence 18 Hit Dice worth of animals.</font></p>

rounds. The ring then ceases to function for six turns (one hour)
while it replenishes itself. The command word is usually engraved
somewhere on the ring. The ring will activate whenever this word is
spoken, even though the command might be given by someone other than
the wearer, provided that the word is spoken within 10 feet of the

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the wearer is associating
with creatures of Intelligence 4 or greater at a distance of 60 feet
or less, the ring enables the wearer to seem to be one of those
creatures, but each turn of such association carries a 5% cumulative
chance that the creatures will detect the ring wearer for what he is.
Thus, such an association can never persist for more than 20 turns
without the wearer being detected—at the end of that time, the
chance of detection has risen to 100%. Creatures with 16 or greater
Intelligence use their Intelligence score as an addition to the base
chance of detection. For example, a creature of Intelligence 16 would
have a base chance of (16+5%) = 21% at the end of turn 1, 26% at the
end of turn 2, and so forth. Creatures with 3 or lower Intelligence
instinctively and automatically detect the wearer if they come within
a 10-foot radius of him.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The four types
of elemental command rings are very powerful. Each appears to be
nothing more than an ordinary ring, but each has certain other powers
as well as the following common properties:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	1. Elementals of the plane to
which the ring is attuned can't attack or even approach within 5 feet
of the wearer. If the wearer desires, he may forego this protection
and instead attempt to </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>charm</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
the elemental (saving throw applicable with a -2 penalty to the die).
If the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>charm</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
fails, however, total protection is lost and no further attempt at
charming can be made, but the secondary properties given below will
then function with respect to the elemental.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	2. Creatures, other than
normal elementals, from the plane to which the ring is attuned attack
with -1 penalties to their attack rolls. The ring wearer takes damage
at -1 on each die of damage and makes applicable saving throws from
the creature's attacks at +2. All attacks are made by the wearer of
the ring with a +4 bonus to the attack roll (or -4 on the elemental
creature's saving throw), and the wearer inflicts +6 damage (total,
not per die) adjusted by any other applicable bonuses and penalties.
Any weapon used by the ring wearer can hit elementals or elemental
creatures even if it is not magical.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	3. The wearer of the ring is
able to converse with the elementals or elemental creatures of the
plane to which the ring is attuned. These creatures will recognize
that he wears the ring, and will show a healthy respect for the
wearer, if alignments are similar. If alignment is opposed, creatures
will fear the wearer if he is strong, hate and desire to slay him if
the wearer is weak. Fear, hatred, and respect are determined by the
DM.</font></p>

The class of spells contained within the ring is determined in the

level of each spell is determined by rolling 1d6 (for priests) or 1d8

to the wearer the names of its spells. Once spell class, level, and
type are determined, the properties of the ring are fixed and
unchangeable. Once a spell is cast from the ring, it can be restored
only by a character of appropriate class and level of experience
(i.e., a 12th-level wizard is needed to restore a 6th-level magical

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This ring
distorts the three normal dimensions, causing many spells cast at the
wearer to rebound upon the spellcaster. Sometimes, a spell's entire
effect is turned against the caster; sometimes, a portion of the
effect rebounds.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some spells are immune from
the effects of a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>ring
of spell turning:</i></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	1. Spells that affect an
area, and which are not cast directly at the ring wearer, are not
turned by the ring.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	2. Spells that are delivered
by touch are not turned.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	3. Magic contained in devices
(rods, staves, wands, rings, and other items) that are triggered
without spellcasting are not turned. A scroll spell is </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>not</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
considered a device.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a spell is cast at an
individual wearing a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>ring
of spell turning,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
1d10 is rolled and the result is multiplied by 10. This score
indicates what percentage of the spell has been turned back upon its
caster.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once the spell is turned, the
effects must be determined. If the spell normally allows a saving
throw, the intended target (the one wearing the ring) gains an
automatic plus equal to the number rolled on the turning die. The
caster receives a bonus equal to the number rolled on the turning
die. The caster receives a bonus equal to the number rolled on this
die subtracted from 10. For example, a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>charm
person</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell is
cast at a character wearing a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>ring
of spell turning.</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> A
7 is rolled on the die, turning back 70% of the effect. The
ring-wearer gains a +7 to his saving throw; the caster has a +3.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A saving throw is also
allowed for spells which normally do not have one if 20% to 80% of
the effect is turned. The saving throw adjustment is calculated as
given above. No further adjustments are made for race, magical items,
or any other condition including existing spells. To save, the
character must have a modified die roll of 20 or greater. If the
saving throw is made, the effect of the spell is negated. For
example, an illusionist casts a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>maze</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell at a fighter wearing a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>ring
of spell turning.</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
The spell normally allows no saving throw, but the ring turns 70% of
the effect. The fighter is allowed a saving throw with a +7 modifier.
The illusionist must also save, gaining only a +3. The fighter's die
roll is 15, which saves (15+7 = 22); the illusionist's die roll is a
16 which, while close, fails (16+3 = 19). The illusionist becomes
trapped in his own </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>maze</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once a spell is turned, the
effects are divided proportionately between the two targets. If the
spell causes damage, determine the damage normally and then assess
the amount to each according to the percentage determined, rounding
fractions to the nearest whole number. If a spell caused 23 points of
damage, and 30% of it was turned, the intended victim would suffer 16
points of damage, while the caster would suffer 7. Durations are
affected in a similar manner. In the above case, the spell duration
would be 30% of its normal length for one character and 70% for the
other. The effect of permanent spells for both characters remains
unchanged.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Some spells affect a certain
number of levels. When one of these is aimed at the ring wearer, the
spell must be able to affect as many levels as the wearer and the
spellcaster combined. If this condition is fulfilled, then the
procedure above applies.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the spellcaster and spell
recipient both wear </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>spell

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Rod
of Absorption:</b></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This rod acts as
a magnet, drawing magic spells of any nature (priest or wizard) into
itself. It then nullifies their effects and stores their potential
until the wielder releases this energy in the form of spells of his
own casting. The magic absorbed must have been directed at the
character possessing the rod. The wielder can instantly detect a
spell's level as the rod absorbs the spell's energy.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A running total of absorbed
(and used) spell levels should be kept. For example, a rod that
absorbs a 6th-level spell and a 3rd-level spell has a total of nine
absorbed levels. The wielder of the rod can use captured spell energy
to cast any spell he has memorized, at a casting time of 1, without
loss of spell memory. The only restriction is that the levels of
spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater than the
level of the spell the wielder wants to cast. Continuing the example
above, the rod-wielder could cast a maximum of one 9th-level spell,
one 6th-level and one 3rd-level, and so on.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>rod
of absorption</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> can
never be recharged. It absorbs 50 spell levels and can thereafter
only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The wielder
will know that the rod's limit has been reached upon grasping the
item. Used charges indicate that it has already absorbed some of its
maximum of 50 spell levels and that some of those have been used.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Here is a more specific
example: A priest uses a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>rod
of absorption</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> to
nullify the effect of a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>hold
person</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell cast
at him by a mage. The rod has now absorbed three spell levels and can
absorb 47 more. The cleric can cast any 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level
spell he has memorized, without memory loss of that spell, by using
the stored potential of the rod. Assume the cleric casts a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>hold
person</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> back. This
spell is only 2nd-level to him, so the rod still holds one spell
level of potential, can absorb 47 more, and has disposed of two
charges permanently.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This magical rod
is indistinguishable from a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>footman's
mace +1.</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> It has
eight flanges on its macelike head. The rod bestows +1 to the
possessor's die roll for being surprised, and in combat the possessor
gains -1 on initiative die rolls. If it is grasped firmly, the rod
enables the character to </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>detect
alignment, evil, good,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
illusions, </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>invisibility,

The use of these detect powers does not expend any of the charges in
the rod.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>rod

planted in the ground, and the possessor wills it to alertness, the
rod will &quot;sense'' any creature intends to harm the possessor.
Each of the flanges on the rod's head then cast a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>light</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell along one of the main directions (N, NE, E, etc.) out to a
60-foot range. At the same time, the rod creates the effect of a
</font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>prayer</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell upon all creatures friendly to the possessor in a 20-foot
radius. Immediately thereafter, the rod sends forth a mental alert to
these friendly creature, warning them of possible danger from the
unfriendly creature(s) within the 120-foot radius.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Lastly, the rod can be used
to simulate the casting of an </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>animate
object</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> spell,
utilizing any 16 (or fewer) objects specially designated by the
possessor and placed roughly around the perimeter of a 6-foot-radius
circle centered on the rod. The selected objects can be 16 shrubs, 16
specially shaped branches, or whatever.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All of the rod's protective
functions require one charge. The </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>animate
object</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> power
require one additional charge, so, if all of the rod's protective
devices are utilized at once, two charges are expended.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The rod can be recharged by a
priest of 16th level or higher, as long as at least one charge
remains in the rod when the recharging is attempted.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This rod enables
its possessor to radiate an emotional and mental wave of fellow
feeling to all creatures with any Intelligence whatsoever (1 or

love and respect the rod wielder. They will listen, trust, and obey
him, insofar as communication is possible and instructions given

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	To find out if the draining
can be prevented, a d20 roll must be made for the target item. If the
die roll result in a number equal to or higher than the number listed
on the table above, the target is unaffected. If the roll is lower,
the item is drained. Upon draining an item, the rod itself becomes

changing from a normal-seeming rod to a double-headed flail. In close
quarters, or if the wielder is mounted, it is the small, horseman's
weapon (base damage 1d4+1, S-M/L); otherwise, it is a footman's
weapon (base damage 1d6+1/2d4, S-M/L).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In either form, the weapon
has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls. Each of the weapon's two
heads can be used to attack, so double hits can be scored, either on
a single opponent or on two opponents who are man-sized or smaller
and standing side by side.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

expends one charge, he gains +4 bonuses on Armor Class and saving

back into a rod) does not expend any charges.</font></p>

the maximum being 200 days divided by the number of creatures
affected. Thus, one creature (the rod's possessor) can stay for 200
days; four creatures can stay for 50 days; a group of 60 creatures
can stay for three days. All fractions are rounded down, so that a
group numbering between 101 and 200 inclusive can stay for one day
only.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	In this &quot;paradise,''
creatures don't age (except from magical causes such as the casting
of a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>wish</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
spell), and natural healing and curing take place at twice the normal
rate. Fresh water and food (fruits and vegetables only) are in
abundance. The climate is comfortable for all creatures involved, so
that protection from the elements is not necessary.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Activation of the rod causes
the wielder and as many creatures as were touched with the item at
the time of use to be transported instantaneously to the paradise.
(Members of large groups can hold hands or otherwise touch each
other, allowing all to be &quot;touched'' by the rod at once.)</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When the rod's effect is
cancelled or expires, all of the affected creatures instantly
reappear in the location they occupied when the rod was activated. If
something else occupies the space that a traveler would be returning
to, then his body is displaced a sufficient distance to provide the
space required for &quot;re-entry.&quot;</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This rod is a +3
magical weapon that inflicts 1d8+3 points of damage. Against golems,
the rod causes 2d8+6 points of damage, and any score of 20 or better
completely destroys the golem. Any hit upon a golem drains one
charge.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The rod causes normal damage

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The possessor of
this rod is automatically and continually bestowed with a Charisma of
18 for as long as the item is held or carried. Whatever garments the
possessor wears (including armor) appear to be of the finest quality
and condition, although no special magical benefit (such as a change
in Armor Class) is enjoyed.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the possessor already has
a Charisma score of 18 or greater, the rod does not further enhance
this attribute. When the possessor expends one charge, the rod
actually creates and garbs him in clothing of the finest fabrics,
plus adornments of furs and jewels.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Apparel created by the magic
of the rod remains in existence unless the possessor attempts to sell
any part of it, or if any of the garb is forcibly taken from. In
either of these cases, all of the apparel immediately disappears. The
garments may be freely given to other characters or creatures,
however, and will remain whole and sound afterward. Characters
bedecked in a magically created outfit can't replace or add garments
by expending another charge—if the possessor tries this, the charge
is simply wasted.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The value of any noble garb
created by the wand will be from 7,000 to 10,000 gp (1d4+6). The
fabric will be worth 1,000 gp, furs 5,000 gp, and jewel trim from
1,000 to 4,000 gp (i.e., 10 gems of 100 gp value each, 10 gems of 200
gp value each or 20 gems of 100 gp value, and so forth).</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The second special power of
the rod, also requiring one charge to bring about, is the creation of
a palatial tent—a huge pavilion of silk encompassing between 1,500
and 3,000 square feet. Inside the tent are temporary   
furnishings and food suitable to the splendor of the pavilion and in
sufficient supply to entertain as many as 100 persons.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The tent and its trappings
will last for one day. At the end of that time, the pavilion may be
maintained by expending another charge. If the extra charge isn't
spent, the tent and all objects associated with it (including any
items that were taken out of the tent) disappear.</font></p>

Furthermore, the wielder can expend a charge to envelop himself in a

must roll successful saving throws vs. rods or be struck motionless
with terror. Those who succeed on their save suffer a -1 penalty to

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Staves are about 5 feet or 6
feet long and as thick as a young sapling—about an inch and a half
at the base, tapering to an inch at the tip, although they can be of
nearly equal diameter throughout. Staves are typically fashioned of
wood, often carved, usually metal bound, and likely to be gnarly and
twisted. They can be unusual or appear to be ordinary.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Staves, like wands and rods,
are powered by charges. A staff typically has 1d6+19 charges when
found. Again, it is possible for a stave to have fewer charges,
although almost none have more than this number. Some staves can be
recharged according to the rules for making magical items. Once all
the charges are used, the stave is rendered nonmagical and cannot be
recharged.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Unless inapplicable or
otherwise specified, staves function at the 8th level of magic use.
Their spell discharge is that of an 8th-level wizard with respect to
range, duration, and area of effect.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Damage is nominally 8d6 with
respect to fireballs, lightning bolts, etc.</font></p>

Words (Optional Rule)</font></font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If the DM desires, unleashing
the power of a stave can require a specific command word or phrase
that must be discovered or researched separately from the item
itself. This command can be as simple as a single word (&quot;Heal'')
or could be as complicated as a rhyming phrase that must be adjusted
to fit the circumstances (&quot;I touch this elf; restore his
health,&quot; or &quot;In this moment of great toil, I command thee,
staff—uncoil!&quot;). Since command words are the key to great
power, wise owners will memorize them and destroy all other evidence.
Indeed, knowledge of command words can be used as a bargaining point
in surrender negotiations.</font></p>

absorb wizard spell energy directed at its wielder, but if the staff
absorbs energy beyond its charge limit, it will explode as if a
&quot;retributive strike&quot; (see below) had been made. The spell
levels of energy absorbed count only as recharging the staff, but
they cannot be redirected immediately, so if absorption is desired,
that is the only action possible by the staff wielder that round.
Note also that the wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast
at him, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>rod

to eight times the number of spell levels of energy in the rod (1 to
25), those between 10 feet to 20 feet take 6 x levels, and those 20

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The python strikes as a +2
magical weapon and inflicts 1d6+2 points of damage when it hits. If
the priest throws the staff to the ground, it grows from its 6-foot
length, becoming a constrictor snake, 25 feet long (AC 3, 49 hit
points, movement rate of 9). This happens in one round. The snake
will entwine if it scores a hit, the opponent being constricted for
2d4+2 points of damage per round. The victim will remain trapped by
the python until he dies or the creature is destroyed. Note that the
python will return to its owner upon command. If it is destroyed
while in snake form, the staff is destroyed.</font></p>

magical weapon and does 2d2 points of damage when it hits. Upon
command the head of the staff becomes that of an actual serpent (AC
5, 20 hit points). This head remains for one full turn. When a hit is
scored, damage is not increased, but the victim must roll a
successful saving throw vs. poison (strength E) or be slain. Only
evil priests will employ an adder staff. If the snake head is killed,
the staff is destroyed.</font></p>

which can be employed </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>only</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
by a druid, is activated when one end of the staff is touched to a
heavy object of roughly spherical shape (a stone, metal ball, pottery
crock, etc.) of up to nine inches in diameter and five pounds in
weight. The object adheres to the end of the staff, and the wielder
need then only swing the staff in an overhand arc to release the
missile toward a desired target.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The missile leaves the staff
on the downstroke of the overhand swing and travels in a low, rising
trajectory, with the missile going one foot upward for every 10 feet
traveled. Of course, the arc may be higher, or the missile aimed so
as to travel nearly vertically. (In the latter case, reverse the
arcing ratio so that one foot of distance laterally is covered for
every 10 feet of vertical rise.) The maximum range of such a missile
is 180 feet, with limits of 60 feet and 120 feet on short and medium
range, respectively.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This staff also carries
charges, and a druid wielding the item can expend one charge and
thereby use the staff to hurl a missile of large size, as if the
wielder were a stone giant (range out to 300 feet, 3d10 points of
damage per hit). Whether used as a magical quarterstaff or by
employing one of its slinging powers, the staff bestows +1 to the
wielder's attack roll and +1 per die to damage dealt out. The weapon
may be recharged by a druid of 12th or higher level.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A staff of this
sort is typically short and thick. When initially obtained or
encountered, much of its length is covered with finely done carvings
depicting winged biting and stinging insects (bees, deerflies,
horseflies, wasps, and the like). Any priest character (cleric,
druid, shaman, witch doctor, etc.) holding it can command the staff
to create a swarm of such insects, at the same time expending one of
the staff's charges.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Range is 60 yards+10 yards
per level of the user. The number of insects produced is 60 plus 10
per level. Every 10 insects will inflict 1 point of damage upon the
target victim, regardless of Armor Class, unless the victim is
protected by a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>force
field,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> engulfed in
flames, etc. Note, however, that the insects will not affect
creatures larger than man-sized with a natural Armor Class of 5 or
better.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	When a vulnerable target is
attacked by the swarm of flying insects, the target will be unable to
do anything other than attempt to dislodge and kill the things. The
insect attack lasts for one round. Each time the staff is employed,
one of the insect-shapes carved into its wooden surface will
disappear, so it is easy to determine how many charges are left in
the staff. Unlike others of its ilk, a staff of this sort can have as
many as 50 initial charges. However, it cannot be recharged.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Wands are 1¼ feet long and
slender. They are made of ivory, bone, or wood and are usually tipped
with something—metal, crystal, stone, etc. They are fragile and

each use costing one or more charges (depending on the item). When
discovered, a wand typically contains 1d20+80 charges. Captured wands
taken from a defeated foe often have many fewer charges. Wands never
have a greater number of charges than those listed. Most wands can be
recharged according to the rules for making magical items.</font></p>

dark brown or black cloth, a cloak of this type is not readily
noticeable as unusual. It radiates both enchantment and alteration in
equal proportions. The cloak bestows a 90% probability of being
invisible when the wearer is stationary within a shadowy or dark
place. The wearer is also able to hang upside down from the ceiling,
like a bat, and to maintain this same chance of invisibility.</font></p>

garment, the wearer is able to fly at a speed of 15 (Maneuver Class:
B). If he desires, the wearer can actually transform himself into an
ordinary bat—all possessions worn or carried will be part of the
transformation—and fly accordingly. Flying, either with the cloak
or as an ordinary bat, can be accomplished only in darkness (either
under the night sky or in a lightless or near-lightless environment
underground). Either of the flying powers is usable for up to one
hour at a time, but after a flight of any duration, the cloak will
not bestow any flying power for a like period of time.</font></p>

his actual position. Any missile or melee attack aimed at the wearer
automatically misses the first time. This can apply to first attacks
from multiple opponents only if the second and successive attackers
were unable to observe the initial displacement miss.</font></p>

When this card is drawn, one of the character's henchmen will be
totally alienated and forever-after hostile. If the character has no

were worn, but this protection cannot be augmented by further magical
means.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Once all of its jewels have
lost their magic, the helm loses all of its powers. The gems turn to
worthless powder when this occurs. Removing a jewel destroys the gem.
They may not be recharged.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	If a creature wearing the
helm is attacked by magical fire and fails to save vs. magical fire,
he must attempt another saving throw for the helmet without magical
additions. If this is failed, the remaining gems on the helm overload
and detonate, inflicting on the wearer whatever accumulated effects
the gems would normally have.</font></p>

loses 18,000-51,000 experience points at the DM's discretion. The
reverse is true with respect to a black robe donned by a good aligned
wizard. An evil or good wizard putting on a gray robe, or a neutral
wizard donning either a white or black robe, incurs 6d4 points
damage, 6,000-24,000 experience points loss, and the wearer will be
moved toward the alignment of the robe by its enchantments (i.e., he
will feel himself urged to change alignment to that of the robe, and
he will have to make an effort to maintain his old alignment).</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The robe does have its
limits: It will not make its wearer appear to be more than twice

hues, color after color cascading from the upper part of the robe to
the hem in sparkling rainbows of dazzling light.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	This effect sheds light in a
40-foot diameter sphere, and it has the power to hypnotize opponents,
making them unable to attack the wearer. A full round passes before
the colors begin &quot;flowing'' on the robe. Each round after that,
any opponent who fails a saving throw vs. spell (or magic resistance
check, then save) will stand hypnotized and transfixed for 1d4+1
rounds. Even when this effect wears off, additional saves must be
made in order to attack.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Furthermore, every round of
continuous scintillation of the robe makes the wearer 5% more
difficult to hit with missile attacks or hand-held or body weaponry
(hands, fists, claws, fangs, horns, etc.) until a maximum of 25% (-5)
is attained—five continuous rounds of the dazzling play of hues.</font></p>

concealment, the wearer is able to cast spells or engage in all forms
of activity that do not require movement of more than 10 feet from
his starting position. In noncombat situations, the robe simply
hypnotizes creatures failing their saving throws vs. spell for 1d4+1
turns.</font></p>

However, it will radiate a strong aura of alteration and evocation if
examined for magic. The robe enables its wearer to travel physically
on the Astral Plane, along with all that he is wearing or carrying.
The garment also enables the wearer to survive comfortably in the
void of outer space. In other situations, the robe gives its wearer a
+1 bonus to all saving throws.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The robe is embroidered with
stars, and the wearer can use up to six of these as missile weapons,
provided he is proficient with darts as a weapon. Each star is a
throwing weapon of +5 value, both to hit and damage. Maximum range is
60 feet and base damage is 2d4 points per hit. The special star
weapons are located on the chest portion of the robe. If the wearer
does not use all of these missiles, they will replace themselves
magically at the rate of one per day. If all six are used, all of the

weapon will, of course, be absolutely true to its alignment, and if
the character who possesses the weapon is not, personality
conflict—weapon versus character—will result.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Similarly, any weapon with an
ego of 19 or higher will always consider itself superior to any

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Note that the personality
score is reduced by one for every group of hit points of damage taken
equal to the character's average number of points per level. Divide
the character's total hit points by his level (round up). For
example: A fighter of 7th level has 53 hit points: 53 divided by 7
equals 7.6. Thus for every eight points of damage he suffers, his
personality score will be lowered by one.</font></p>
<p class="western" >

<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Any time the personality
score of a weapon exceeds the personality score of the character who
possesses it, the weapon will dominate its possessor, and it can
force any or all of the above demands or actually cause any of the
following actions:</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	1. Force its possessor into

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	2. Refuse to strike opponents</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	3. Strike at its wielder or

<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	4. Force its possessor to
surrender to an opponent</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	5. Cause itself to drop from
the character's grasp</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Naturally, such actions are
unlikely where the character-weapon alignment and purposes are
harmonious. However, the weapon might well wish to have a lesser
character possess it so as to easily command him, or a higher level
possessor so as to better accomplish its goals.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	All magical weapons with
personalities will desire to play an important role in the success of
activities, particularly combat. Such weapons are rivals of each
other, even if of the same alignment. They will be aware of the
presence of any similar weapon within 60 feet, and try their best to
lead a possessor into missing or destroying the rival unless this is
totally inimical to its nature—a </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>holy
avenger,</i></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"> for
example, would certainly not allow destruction of any other lawful
good weapon and might encourage their discovery, even at the risk of
having to face grim odds to do so.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Weapons of this nature will
never be totally controlled or silenced by the characters who possess
them, even though they may be heavily outweighed by personality
force. They may be powerless to force their demands, but they will be
in there plugging. Even a humble +1 weapon of unusual nature can be a
vocal martyr, denigrating its own abilities and asking only that the
character give it the chance to shatter itself against some hated
enemy, etc.</font></p>
<p class="western" >
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Note: Most players will be
unwilling to play weapons with personalities as the personalities
dictate. It is incumbent upon the DM to ensure that the role of the
weapon is played to the hilt, so to speak, with the DM assuming the
persons of the weapon if necessary.</font></p>
