<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Beads of Force:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">These small, black spheres might be mistaken for common beads, marbles, or
unusually black but lusterless pearls. From 5-8 of these beads are usually found
at one time. Each is about three-quarters of an inch in diameter and quite
heavy, weighing almost an ounce. One can be hurled up to 30 yards.
<P></P>
Upon impact, the bead sends forth a burst of force that inflicts 5d4 points of
damage upon all creatures within a 10-foot radius of its center. Each victim
is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. Those who save will be thrown out of the
blast area, but those who fail to save will be encapsulated by a <I>sphere of force</I> after taking damage.
<P></P>
The sphere will form around any and all such creatures in the 10-foot-radius
area, even those of large size, and will persist for 3d4 rounds. Victims will be
unable to escape except by the same means and used to bring down a <I>wall of force</I> spell.
