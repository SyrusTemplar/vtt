The movement point costs given above assume the best of conditions even in the
worst of terrain. The mountains are assumed to be free of cliffs; the woods
have no high-banked streams; rains haven't turned the plains to mud; the tundra
hasn't been blanketed in snow. However, poor traveling conditions do occur, and
when they do travel is slowed. <A HREF="DD00640.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00640.htm">Table 75</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> lists common obstacles and situations that slow movement. The modifiers for
these are listed as either additional movement point costs or multipliers.
<P></P>
When additional movement costs are listed, these are added to the cost of the
surrounding terrain. Thus, crossing a ridge in the high mountains costs nine
movement points for that mile instead of the normal eight.
<P></P>
Multipliers increase the movement cost by the amount listed. Snow, for
example, doubles the cost of crossing the plains. Indeed, severe weather or torrential
rains?can actually bring all travel to a halt.
