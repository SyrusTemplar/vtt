<B>Description:</B> The Berserker is a warrior who has special attributes and abilities when he's
in combat. In combat, he can achieve an ecstatic state of mind that will
enable him to fight longer, harder, and more savagely than any human being has a
right to. This makes him a deadly warrior . . . who can be as much a menace to
himself as to his enemies. In a campaign, he's nearly identical to the
Barbarian?except it's obvious from the outset that he has a truly savage and inhuman
element in his personality, and he tends to disturb and unsettle other people.
<P></P>
Like the Barbarian, the Berserker<I> must have a Strength ability score of 15 or more.</I>
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> In his tribe, the Berserker has a special role. He's been touched by
supernatural forces, and accepted that touch so that he might better defend his people.
<P></P>
The idea of a Berserker Paladin is a little strange, and some Dms will prefer
not to allow it. That's fine. It's not always inappropriate, though. If the
character's tribe is deeply involved with an appropriate animal totem, such as a
bear or wolverine, a paladin might even be <I>required</I> to be a Berserker, since the DM may reason that it's only the supernatural
touch of the totem animal spirit that gives the paladin his other powers. But,
again, that's up to the individual DM.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> As with the Barbarian, the DM will decide what sort of secondary skill is
most appropriate for that specific barbarian/berserker tribe.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> No specific weapon proficiencies are required of the Berserker?but he may not
start out play having a proficiency in a ranged weapon (no thrown axes or
knives, no bows or crossbows, etc.). The Berserker lives to destroy things in
hand-to-hand combat, so he cannot start play with any sort of ranged weapon
proficiency. He can learn others during the course of the campaign, if he and his DM
wish to allow it?but it's a little out of character for the Berserker.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Bonus Proficiency: Endurance. Recommended: General?Animal Handling, Animal
Training, Direction Sense, Fire-Building, Riding (Land-Based), Weather Sense,
(Warrior) Blind-Fighting, Hunting, Mountaineering, Running, Set Snares, Survival,
Tracking, (Priest?costs twice the listed number of slots if Fighter or Ranger)
Herbalism, (Rogue?costs double slots) Jumping. As with the Barbarian, the DM
may choose to insist that the Berserker character take a proficiency in the
tribal specialty (Trapping, Agriculture, etc.).
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> As with the Barbarian, the Berserker may not use his starting gold to buy
armor heavier than splint mail, banded mail, or bronze plate mail. Once he has
adventured in the outer world, he can use any type of armor without penalty. When
he spends his starting gold, he must limit himself to weapons known to his
tribe, and may not choose missile weapons. Good choices include battle axe, club,
dagger or dirk, footman's flail, mace, or pick, hand axe, spear, or sword (any).
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> Berserkers receive a +3 reaction adjustment bonus from NPCs belonging to any
tribe that also has Berserkers?they recognize the Berserker instinctively and
respect him, even if he is an enemy.
<P></P>
The other benefit the Berserker receives is his Berserk.
<P></P>
At any time, the Berserker may choose to Go Berserk. This isn't an
instantaneous process?he must spend a little time to &quot;psych himself up.&quot; It takes a full <I>turn</I> (ten combat rounds) to Go Berserk. In that time, the character is growling,
moaning, uttering imprecations . . . it's impossible to be quiet when trying to
Go Berserk. He may also be fighting during that time, meaning that he can
start to Go Berserk on the round the fight begins, fight for ten full rounds, and
then be Berserk on the eleventh round.
<P></P>
Of course, when the Berserker knows a fight is coming, he can begin to Go
Berserk, even if there is no fight currently going on. At the end of a full turn of
preparation, he can become Berserk instantaneously. If there's no enemy in
sight yet, he can hold the Berserk until combat is engaged. But if no combat takes
place within five more full turns, he automatically reverts to &quot;normal&quot; and
suffers the ordinary consequences for coming out of a Berserk (described below).
The character can come out of his Berserk once the last enemy is down (he must
literally be down on the ground, even if still alive and surrendering; the
Berserker will stay berserk and continue fighting so long as there are enemies
still on their feet). Once the fight ends, the Berserker must come out of his
Berserk state.
<P></P>
For these reasons, Berserking is a more appropriate reaction when the
characters are about to attack or be attacked by a foe they know about. If the
characters are, instead, jumped by a small party of orcs, it's usually not worth the
effort to Go Berserk; the consequences and effort outweigh the benefits.
<P></P>
When Berserk, the character has phenomenal endurance and resistance to pain
and some forms of magic. Only while Berserk, he gains the following benefits:
<P></P>
(1) He is immune (no Saving Throw is necessary) to the wizard spells <I>charm person, friends, hypnotism, sleep, irritation, ray of enfeeblement,
scare, geas,</I> and the clerical spells<I> command, charm person</I> or <I>mammal, enthrall, cloak of bravery,</I> and <I>symbol</I>.
<P></P>
(2) He gets a +4 to save against the wizard spells <I>blindness, Tasha's uncontrollable hideous laughter, hold person, charm monster,</I> and<I> confusion,</I> and the clerical spells <I>hold person</I> and <I>hold animal.
<P></P>
</I> (3) The <I>emotion</I> spell has no effect on the Berserker, unless the caster chose the <I>fear</I> result. If <I>fear</I> was chosen, the Berserker gets a normal Saving Throw; if he makes it, he
continues on as before, but if he fails it, he is prematurely snapped out of his
Berserk, with all the normal effects of coming out of the Berserk (but he doesn't
suffer other fear effect). The <I>fear</I> spell has exactly the same effect: If he saves, there is no effect, and if he
doesn't save, he's snapped out of the Berserk. If he fails a saving throw
against <I>charm monster</I>, he simply counts the caster as one of his allies; he doesn't come out of the
Berserk or obey the caster's commands.
<P></P>
(4) Being Berserk offers no real protection from<I> finger of death,</I> except that the spell effects do not take place until the character has come
out of his Berserk. If the Berserker saves, he doesn't suffer the 2d8+1 damage
until immediately after he snaps out of the Berserk. If he fails to save, he
doesn't die until he snaps out of the Berserk.
<P></P>
(5) The Berserker, while Berserk, is immune to KO results from the Punching
and Wrestling rules, and takes only half damage from bare-handed attacks from
these rules.
<P></P>
(6) While Berserk, the character gets +1 to attack, +3 to damage, and +5 hp.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> The Berserker has hindrances as severe as all those benefits he receives.
<P></P>
(1) The Berserker character receives a ?3 reaction from all NPCs (except, that
is, characters from tribes which have berserkers in them, as described above).
<P></P>
(2) When the Berserker goes Berserk, the DM should immediately say to him,
&quot;Tell me how many hit points you currently have.&quot; From that point until the fight
is done and the Berserker has returned to normal, the DM keeps track of his hit
points. The player is not told how many hp he has left, nor how many points of
damage he is taking with each attack. (After all, the character can feel no
pain . . . so he cannot keep track of how close he is to death.) The DM simply
tells him something like: &quot;The orc-captain hits you with his axe, a mighty blow
which you barely feel . . .&quot; It is therefore very possible for a Berserker to
be nickled and dimed to death and not know it until he drops dead. The DM can
also, if he so chooses, roll all Saving Throws for the Berserker, not telling the
player whether they were failures or successes.
<P></P>
(3) While Berserk, the character can use no ranged weapons. He kills only in
hand-to-hand or melee-weapon combat.
<P></P>
(4) While Berserk, he must fight each opponent until that opponent is down.
Once an opponent is felled, the Berserker must move to the nearest enemy and
attack <I>him</I>. He can't, for instance, choose to attack the enemy leader if that leader is
behind seven ranks of spearmen. The Berserker must keep fighting until all
enemies are down, as described earlier.
<P></P>
(5) While Berserk, the character cannot take cover against missile fire.
<P></P>
(6) If, while the character is Berserk, another character tries something he
can interpret as attack (for instance, hits him to move him out of the way of an
incoming attack,) the Berserker must roll 1d20 vs. his Intelligence. If he
succeeds (that is, rolls his Intelligence score or less), he's dimly aware that
his friend is not attacking him. If he fails (rolls higher than his
Intelligence), he now thinks his friend is an enemy, and continues to think so until the
fight is done and he is no longer Berserk.
<P></P>
(7) While Berserk, the character is temporarily unaffected by the clerical
spells <I>bless, cure light wounds, aid, cure serious wounds, cure critical wounds,
heal, regenerate</I> (and <I>wither</I>). He will gain the benefits of those spells only <I>after</I> he has come out of his Berserk and suffered any and all damages which
occurred then.
<P></P>
(8) The <I>taunt</I> spell is automatically successful, and will cause the Berserker to abandon
his current enemy and rush to attack the taunter.
<P></P>
(9) Finally, when the character comes out of his Berserk, bad things happen to
him. He loses the 5 hp he gained when he became Berserk. (This could drop him
to or below 0 hp and kill him, of course.) He collapses in exhaustion (exactly
as if hit by a <I>ray of enfeeblement</I>, no saving throw possible, for one round for every round he was Berserk. He
suffers the effects of any spells which wait until he's returned to normal
before affecting him (<I>finger of death</I>, for instance). And only then can healing spells affect him.
<P></P>
<B>Wealth Options:</B> The Berserker gets the ordinary 5d4x10 gp for starting gold. Like the
Barbarian, however, he must spend it all (before starting play) except three gp or
less.
<P></P>
<B>Races: </B>It's the DM's choice as to whether his demihuman characters can have
Berserkers among them. It's entirely appropriate for dwarves, and not inappropriate for
elves, gnomes and half-elves. Halfling Berserkers are not very likely. In any
case, demihuman Berserkers would not advertise the fact that they were such;
until the first time they Berserked in combat, their companions would probably
be unaware that they were Berserkers. (The DM can help preserve the secret by
not publicizing the fact that all NPCs are taking a ?3 to reaction rolls
concerning the Berserker characters.)
