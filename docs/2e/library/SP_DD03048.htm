<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Gaming:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character with this proficiency is familiar with all manner of gambling
games. A successful proficiency check means the character will win a given game
being played with NPCs-although cumulative negative modifiers should be assigned
for each NPC with the gaming proficiency. Subtract 1 for each proficient NPC,
with ?2 for those with higher than basic gaming expertise.
<P></P>
The character might try to cheat, which confers a +3 to the gaming proficiency
score and requires a check. If the proficiency check rolled is a 20, the
character gets caught cheating, even if no NPCs have the gaming proficiency. Add one
to this spread for each NPC with gaming proficiency-i.e., if two others have
this skill, the cheater will be caught on a roll of 18?20.
