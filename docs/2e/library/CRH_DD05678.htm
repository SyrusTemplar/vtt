The ranger is one of the most popular character classes in the AD&amp;D® game. A
woodsman and tracker, as well as a dangerous fighter, he combines good combat
skills with a few extra abilities that give him many options and decisions during
play. He boasts the courage and strength of a warrior and the stealth and
self-reliance of a thief. He combines the druid's affinity for the outdoors with
the devotion and magical aptitude of a priest. He's a hunter, a tracker, and a
survivalist. By temperament and by choice, he's a loner, often preferring the
company of animals to people. Without question, he's one with nature, sworn to
protect the inhabitants of the wilderness and preserve the integrity of the land.

   The ranger's origins can be traced to the time when isolated human settlements
were first founded in areas of unclaimed wilderness, or in areas occupied only
by savage humanoid tribes. Those who were at first hunters, trappers, and
guides were turned by the necessities of survival into canny wilderness warriors;
and ultimately into the principle protectors of the scattered settlements of
humans and demihumans, which had to fend off countless humanoid raids.

   Few in number, but effective far beyond the power of local militias or the
occasional military patrol of a ruling lord, the rangers have kept a protective
watch on the forward frontier of human expansion. There are seldom more than one
or two to be found in any place, but somehow, as a group, they manage to cover
huge areas of the frontier. Where the tide of expansion has been turned back,
they are the last to fight a desperate rear guard action against encroaching
hordes of evil humanoids.

   In more civilized areas, it is common for kings and wealthy nobles to annex
large tracts of forests for personal use. Some are maintained as private game
preserves, others are harvested for the valuable timber. As a king's wilderness
holdings grow, so does the need to protect them. But suitable candidates are hard
to come by. Often, from among local woodsmen and hunters, able-bodied and
trustworthy retainers are recruited as forest justices or wardens. Skilled in the
management of land, wilderness survival, and natural lore, the forest justices
are charged with guarding the king's holdings, preserving his game from poachers
and his subjects from outlaws and brigands.

   In other places, the local authorities have either lost control or become
tyrannical. Perhaps the local order has broken down and the land is overrun by
bandits or robbers. Perhaps a bad ruler has taken over and driven the peasantry
beyond all possible tolerance. At such time a hero may arise, striding out of the
wilderness, setting right the wrongs, returning a just overlord to power, and
then disappearing back into wild and unknown lands. Such is the stuff of
legends. Such is the legacy of the ranger.
