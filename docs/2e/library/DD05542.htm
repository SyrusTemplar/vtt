<P></P>
This is an evil god which dislikes mankind and other sentient races. It
creates new and ever-more-terrifying illnesses to inflict upon the sentient races.
<P></P>
The priests of this god spread illness and ignorance. They carry infected
victims and rats infested with disease-bearing insects to new ports. Through their
actions, they deny their victims an honorable death and can sometimes topple
entire civilizations. This is not a character class for PCs to take unless the
campaign is very unusual.
<P></P>
Lesser gods of disease would be gods of specific ailments. It's entirely
appropriate, for instance, for the Black Plague to have its own representative god.
<P></P>
Gods of disease are just as likely to be male as female.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Death and Evil.
The priests of this god dislike the priests of Birth/Children, Fire, Healing,
and Strength.

<B>Followers and Strongholds:</B> The followers are received at 9th level, and consist of one fifth-level

and ten first-level fighters. The priest may take the following on adventures:
Three priests (only one of whom can be third-level) and three fighters of his
choice. The priesthood will pay for half of the cost of stronghold construction at
9th level. In most cultures, to keep the priesthood safe from the wrath of the
people, the priests will have to keep the location of the stronghold secret;
it must either be built in the wilderness, or may be built in a community if it
is disguised as some other facility (for example, the front rooms may
ironically be a healer's guild, while the back rooms are where the real temple
activities take place).
