<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Appraising:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This proficiency is highly useful for thieves, as it allows characters to
estimate the value and authenticity of antiques, art objects, jewelry, cut
gemstones, or other crafted items they find (although the DM can exclude those items
too exotic or rare to be well known). The character must have the item in hand to
examine. A successful proficiency check (rolled by the DM) enables the
character to estimate the value of the item to the nearest 100 or 1,000 gp and to
identify fakes. On a failed check, the character cannot estimate a price at all. On
a roll of 20, the character wildly misreads the value of the item, always to
the detriment of the character.
