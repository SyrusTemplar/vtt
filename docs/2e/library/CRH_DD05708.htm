<FONT SIZE="4"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Kit Subsections</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; All character kits described in this
chapter consist of the following elements:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Description:</B> This section
describes the features that distinguish a character associated with
this kit, including his cultural background, duties, manner, and appearance.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Requirements:</B> Any special racial,
ability score, or alignment requirements are listed here. Characters
can't take the kit if they don't meet the listed qualifications.
&quot;Standard&quot; means that no special racial or ability
requirements apply to this kit. A good alignment is assumed.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Primary Terrain:</B> Certain kits tend
to be associated with specific environments. <I>Required</I>
indicates that a character taking the kit must take the indicated
primary terrain; if more than one type is listed, the player may
choose whichever type he prefers. <I>Recommended</I> means that a
character taking this kit is advised to use one of the listed primary
terrain types, but isn't required to do so. <I>Any</I> means that
there are no required or recommended types for this kit; the player
may use any primary terrain he likes.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Role:</B> The character's role in
society and in a campaign is detailed here. Typical motivations,
personality, and beliefs are examined, along with common
relationships with other people, reasons for joining an adventuring
party, and usual function within a party. Note that these traits
don't necessarily apply to each and every character associated with
this kit; players may shape the personalities of their characters
based on these suggestions, or they may disregard them entirely and
create personalities of their own design.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Secondary Skills:</B> If you're using
the rules for secondary skills from Chapter 5 of the <I>Player's Handbook,</I>
the character is restricted to the choice of skills listed in this
section, or &quot;no skill.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> If you're
using the weapon proficiency rules, a kit may require the character
to take specific weapon proficiencies or choose from a restricted
list. Alternately, the character may have the option of choosing from
a list of recommended weapons.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Although
nonweapon proficiency rules are technically optional, they're
strongly recommended when using ranger kits. However, if you're using
secondary skills, you shouldn't use nonweapon proficiencies.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Bonus</I> proficiencies are received
free of charge; they cost no proficiency slots. A <I>required</I>
proficiency must be taken and does cost slots. <I>Recommended</I>
proficiencies are skills typical for the kit. They cost the normal
number of proficiency slots. It's a good idea for a beginning player
to spend all or most of the ranger's initial slots on recommended
proficiencies. <I>Barred</I> proficiencies cannot be taken initially,
though they can be taken during play.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; An asterisk (*) indicates a new
proficiency described in Chapter 5.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Some character types tend to
use specific equipment, while others have limitations on the items
available to them. Requirements and recommendations are given here,
along with any style preferences associated with the kit. Unless
indicated otherwise, a character must buy the required equipment,
including weapons, from his initial funds. Like all members of the
warrior group, a ranger begins with 50-200 (5d4 * 10) gp. If he lacks
the funds to buy all of his required equipment, he should buy as much
as he can, then pick up the rest as soon as he gets the money.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Species Enemy:</B> A particular
species enemy may be required or recommended. If the enemy is <I>required</I>,
the character has no choice; he must take the indicated creature as
a species enemy. If more than one creature is listed as a required
enemy, the character can pick the one he prefers. <I>Recommended</I>
enemies are only suggestions; the character may choose one if he
likes, or ignore the recommendation. <I>Any</I> means that a ranger
should choose his species enemy normally, as described in Chapter 2.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Followers:</B> As with the species
enemy entry, this section may include either required or recommended
followers. The DM should make sure that at least one of each <I>required</I>
type shows up as a follower some time in the ranger's career
(depending on there being enough slots available). <I>Recommended</I>
followers show up at the DM's option. Any means that the character
has no special follower restrictions or recommendations.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Special Benefits:</B> All kits give
special benefits that aren't normally available to other characters.
Typical benefits include improved abilities, special relationships
with followers, and reaction bonuses. All benefits are received free
of charge, and don't count against the normal limitations of the
ranger class.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Special Hindrances:</B> To balance
their special benefits, kits also carry special hindrances.
Hindrances may include reaction penalties, cultural restrictions, or
ability limitations. All special hindrances are in addition to any
disadvantages normally associated with the ranger class.</FONT></P>
