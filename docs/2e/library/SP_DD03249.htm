With this power, the user harnesses, focuses, and explosively releases the
latent psionic energy inside non sentient (0 Intelligence) plants and inanimate
objects. The power also works against animated undead (skeletons and zombies),
but doesn’t affect incorporeal undead. It can’t be used against animals,
intelligent creatures, or free-willed undead.
<P></P>
The explosion causes destructive damage to the target, based on the MTHAC0
roll. If the roll is equal to the power’s MAC, 10% of the target area is
destroyed. For every number rolled above the MAC, an additional 10% is destroyed, up to
a total of 8 cubic feet of material (by a single power use).
<P></P>
Monsters such as skeletons and golems targeted by the detonate power take
damage based on the percentage of their mass that was destroyed, losing an equal
percentage of hit points. Magically animated material, like golems, can make a
saving throw vs. spell to resist detonation.
<P></P>
Weapons and armor that have been detonated receive penalties of –1 to attack
rolls and AC values for each 10% destroyed. Magical items make a saving throw
vs. disintegration to resist detonation. Vulnerable objects or living things
within 10 feet of the target suffer 1d10 points of damage from the resulting
explosion. A save vs. breath weapon reduces damage to half.
