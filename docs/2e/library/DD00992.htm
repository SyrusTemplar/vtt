<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Manual of Bodily Health:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The metal-bound <I>manual of bodily health</I> appears to be an arcane, rare, but nonmagical book. If a <I>detect magic</I> spell is cast upon it, the manual will radiate an aura of magic. Any
character who reads the work (24 hours of time over 3-5 days) will know how to increase
his Constitution by one pointâ€”this involves a special dietary regimen and
breathing exercises over a one-month period. The book disappears immediately upon
completion of its contents.
<P></P>
The point of Constitution is gained only after the prescribed regimen is
followed. In three months the knowledge of the secrets to bodily health will be
forgotten. The knowledge cannot be articulated or recorded by the reader. The
manual will not be useful to any character a second time, nor will more than one
character be able to benefit from a single copy.
