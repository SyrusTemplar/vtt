By completing this ritual, a high priest forges a powerful pact with his or
her deity. The covenant ensures that a chosen individual will survive an untimely
death. A <I>death pact</I> is triggered whenever the protected individual is reduced to fewer than 0 hit
points (mortally wounded) due to combat, spell, or accident. In the same
round, the subject receives the following benefits:
<P></P>
? The individual (or his or her remains) and all possessions are transported
immediately back to a religious sanctuary as if by a <I>word of recall</I> (the location of the sanctuary must be specified at the time of forging the <I>death pact</I>).
<P></P>
? Upon arrival, the individual receives a <I>raise dead</I> spell (if necessary) and automatically makes any required system shock roll.
<P></P>
? Any physical damage sustained by the individual is completely <I>healed</I> except for 2?5 (1d4+1) points of damage.
<P></P>
? Any severed or amputated limbs are instantaneously <I>regenerated</I>.
<P></P>
? The body is cleared of lingering enchantments with a <I>dispel magic</I> (bestowed at caster-s level), whether beneficial or baneful, and cleansed of
all poisons, diseases, blindness, curses, and insanity.
<P></P>
A <I>death pact</I> will remain in effect indefinitely until the conditions established at the
time of its forging have been fulfilled. The <I>pact </I>may be established to benefit an individual other than the caster. However, in
almost all cases, the chosen one must be in good standing with the caster-s
religion and agree to undertake a mission that will directly benefit the deity or
dark power responsible for granting the spell. A <I>dispel magic</I> cannot end a <I>death pact</I> prematurely.
<P></P>
This powerful spell is not without its costs, however. Forging a <I>death pact</I> is an exhaustively stressful process, drawing the priest into draining
audiences with extraplanar powers. As a result, establishing a <I>death pact</I> ages the caster five years and requires at least one week for complete
recuperation, during which time the priest cannot cast any spells or engage in any
physically demanding activity. Furthermore, when the pact is invoked, the
mystical transport and instantaneous healing exacts another toll, this time aging the
recipient for five years (if the individual was raised, he or she also loses
one point of Constitution permanently). Thus, if the priest casts the spell on
him- or herself, he or she must be prepared to sacrifice at least ten years of
life!
<P></P>
The spell-s material components are an (un)holy sanctuary consecrated to the
caster-s deity and seven drops each of the caster-s blood, the recipient-s
blood, (un)holy water, and dew. This powerful pact has enabled many -slain? priests
to return from the dead and eliminate their enemies. Wicked necromancers in the
service of evil deities are rumored to have significantly reduced the terrible
personal toll on the caster by some unspeakably foul sacrifice. Note that
powerful wizard necromancers might achieve a similar effect with <I>wish</I>-fortified <I>contingency</I> spells.
