Most priesthoods demand some sort of minimum ability scores of their priests.
<P></P>
The prime characteristic of priests is Wisdom. To be a priest of any sort
whatsoever, the character must have at least a wisdom of 9. Some priesthoods will
require that the wisdom score be higher, though usually not higher than 13.
<P></P>
Generally, if the priest's Wisdom is 16 or better, he gets a +10% bonus to his
earned experience.
<P></P>
Many priesthoods will require a second prime requisite. For example, priests
of a god of War may have to have a certain Strength score, while priests of a
god of Magic might have to have a certain Intelligence score. Usually, this
second prime requisite must have a score of at least 12; up to 15 is not an
excessive requirement.
<P></P>
In such cases, the DM may decide that the character, if he has <I>either</I> the Wisdom score or the other Prime Requisite at a score of 16, gets a +5%
bonus to earned experience, but if he has <I>both</I>, he gets a +10% bonus.
<P></P>
In the next chapter, you'll find numerous examples of such priesthoods and
recommended minimum ability scores for them.
