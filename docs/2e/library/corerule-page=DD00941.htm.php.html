When in place, the wearer is able to <I>charm persons</I> merely by meeting their gaze. Those failing a saving throw vs. spell are
charmed as per the spell. The user can look at and charm one person per round.
Saving throws suffer a -2 penalty if the wearer has both lenses, or a +2 bonus if
he wears only one of a pair of <I>eyes of charming.</I>
