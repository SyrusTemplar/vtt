Whew, another big project behind me! Never did I realize when I started work
on the <I>Tome of Magic</I> that it would become such an undertaking. After all, it seemed so simple. At
that point, I should have known better.
<P></P>
<P></P>
It all started with a seemingly innocent comment, something like, &quot;There are a
lot of gaps in the spell lists for wizards and priests. Maybe we should do
something about it.&quot; I don't know if I said that, or if it was someone else's
idea, but whoever said it was right. I knew they were right because I could see
them clearly by the time the AD&amp;D® 2nd Edition<I> Player's Handbook</I> was finished.
<P></P>
<P></P>
These gaps were not yawning chasms in the game system. They were little
things, like, &quot;Gee, it would be nice to have a spell that did X--or Y, or Z, or
whatever. &quot;Sometimes they were things to help explain the weirdness people were
always putting in adventures or little touches that would smooth things out for
players and DMs alike. The <I>Tome of Magic</I> could be just the place to get some of these ideas into the AD&amp;D® game
system. Months later (because months always pass between the idea and actually doing
the work), it was time to make all this real.
<P></P>
<P></P>
That's when I discovered the warts on the great idea--two in particular.
First, filling a book with a mis-matched collection of spells was not enough. How
many variations on <I>fireball, lightning bolt,</I> and <I>confusion</I> did you really need? Second, a book of odds and ends didn't sound exciting
for either a game designer or for the players. The <I>Tome of Magic</I> needed something--a hook--to make it interesting.
<P></P>
<P></P>
As a result, the <I>Tome of Magic</I> is much more than just a collection of spells. There are many new ideas about
the types and uses of magic in these pages--wild magic, cooperative magic,
focuses, elementalists, and more. In the end, the <I>Tome of Magic</I> offers more than just spells--it gives breadth and range to wizards and
priests. In many ways, it is a peek inside the Pandora's box of magic.
<P></P>
<P></P>
On top of these concerns was a problem of mental health. If I alone had to
fill all these pages with spells and magical items, I'd be writing from the
nut-house by now. There was no way I could create all these new spells and remain
sane. That's why there is a host of designers listed in the credits. Taking often
the barest of my ideas and suggestions, these creative conspirators produced a
wide variety of spells and items. After weeding out spells too similar in form
and function, I can offer you the cleverness and diversity of six different
designers, not just one! For myself and the other designers, we hope you find the <I>Tome of Magic</I> both entertaining and useful. Let it be your guide to just how much further
wizards and priests can go in the AD&amp;D game.
