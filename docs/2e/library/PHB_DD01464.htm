</B>The paladin is a noble and heroic warrior, the symbol of all that is right and
true in the world. As such, he has high ideals that he must maintain at all
times. Throughout legend and history there are many heroes who could be called
paladins: Roland and the 12 Peers of Charlemagne, Sir Lancelot, Sir Gawain, and
Sir Galahad are all examples of the class. However, many brave and heroic
soldiers have tried and failed to live up to the ideals of the paladin. It is not an
easy task!
<P></P>
Only a human may become a paladin. He must have minimum ability scores of
Strength 12, Constitution 9, Wisdom 13, and Charisma 17. Strength and Charisma are
the prime requisites of the paladin. A paladin must be lawful good in alignment
and must always remain lawful good. A paladin who changes alignment, either
deliberately or inadvertently, loses all his special powers -- sometimes only
temporarily and sometimes forever. He can use any weapon and wear any type of
armor.
<P></P>
A paladin who has Strength and Charisma scores of 16 or more gains a 10% bonus
to the experience points he earns.
<P></P>
Lawfulness and good deeds are the meat and drink of a paladin. If a paladin
ever knowingly performs a chaotic act, he must seek a high-level (7th or more)
cleric of lawful good alignment, confess his sin, and do penance as prescribed by
the cleric. If a paladin should ever knowingly and willingly perform an evil
act, he loses the status of paladinhood immediately and irrevocably. All
benefits are then lost and no deed or magic can restore the character to paladinhood:
He is ever after a fighter. The character's level remains unchanged when this
occurs and experience points are adjusted accordingly. Thereafter the character
is bound by the rules for fighters. He does not gain the benefits of weapon
specialization (if this is used) since he did not select this for his character at
the start.
<P></P>
If the paladin commits an evil act while enchanted or controlled by magic, he
loses his paladin status until he can atone for the deed. This loss of status
means the character loses all his special abilities and essentially functions as
a fighter (without weapon specialization) of the same level. Regaining his
status undoubtedly requires completion of some dangerous quest or important
mission to once again prove his worth and assuage his own guilt. He gains no
experience prior to or during the course of this mission, and regains his standing as a
paladin only upon completing the quest.
<P></P>
A paladin has the following special benefits:
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>A paladin can detect the presence of evil intent</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">up to 60 feet away by concentrating on locating evil in a particular
direction. He can do this as often as desired, but each attempt takes one round. This
ability detects evil monsters and characters.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>A paladin receives a +2 bonus to all saving throws.
<P></P>
A paladin is immune to all forms of disease.</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">(Note that certain magical afflictions --lycanthropy and mummy rot --are
curses and not diseases.)
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>A paladin can heal by laying on hands.</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The paladin restores 2 hit points per experience level. He can heal himself or
someone else, but only once per day.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>A paladin can cure diseases</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">of all sorts (though not cursed afflictions such as lycanthropy). This can be
done only once per week for each five levels of experience (once per week at
levels 1 through 5, twice per week at levels 6 through 10, etc.).
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>A paladin is surrounded by an aura of protection</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">with a 10-foot radius. Within this radius, all summoned and specifically evil
creatures suffer a -1 penalty to their attack rolls, regardless of whom they
attack. Creatures affected by this aura can spot its source easily, even if the
paladin is disguised.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>A paladin using a <I>holy sword</I> projects a circle of power</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">10 feet in diameter when the sword is unsheathed and held. This power dispels
hostile magic of a level up to the paladin's experience level. (<I>A holy sword</I> is a very special weapon; if your paladin acquires one, the DM will explain
its other powers.) See <A HREF="DMG_DD01124.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD01124.htm">Sword, +5 Holy Avenger</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>A paladin gains the power to turn undead and fiends</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">when he reaches 3rd level. He affects these monsters the same as does a cleric
two levels lower--for example, at 3rd level he has the turning power of a
1st-level cleric. See the section on <A HREF="DD01477.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01477.htm">priests</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> for more details on this ability.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>A paladin may call for his war horse</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">upon reaching 4th level, or anytime thereafter. This faithful steed need not
be a horse; it may be whatever sort of creature is appropriate to the character
(as decided by the DM). A paladin's war horse is a very special animal, bonded
by fate to the warrior. The paladin does not really -call? the animal, nor does
the horse instantly appear in front of him. Rather, the character must find
his war horse in some memorable way, most frequently by a specific quest.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>A paladin can cast priest spells</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">once he reaches 9th level. He can cast only spells of the combat, divination,
healing, and protective spheres. (Spheres are explained in the <A HREF="DD01477.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01477.htm">Priest</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> section.) The acquisition and casting of these spells abide by the rules
given for priests.
<P></P>
The spell progression and casting level are listed in <A HREF="DD01465.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01465.htm">Table 17</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. Unlike a priest, the paladin does <I>not</I> gain extra spells for a high Wisdom score. The paladin cannot cast spells
from clerical or druidical scrolls nor can he use priest items unless they are
allowed to the warrior group.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>A paladin may not possess more than 10 magical items.</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Furthermore, these may not exceed one suit of armor, one shield, four weapons
(arrows and bolts are not counted), and four other magical items.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>A paladin never retains wealth.</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">He may keep only enough treasure to support himself in a modest manner, pay
his henchmen, men-at-arms, and servitors a reasonable rate, and to construct or
maintain a small castle or keep (funds can be set aside for this purpose). All
excess must be donated to the church or another worthy cause. This money can
never be given to another player character or NPC controlled by a player.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>A paladin must tithe</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">to whatever charitable, religious institution of lawful good alignment he
serves. A tithe is 10% of the paladin's income, whether coins, jewels, magical
items, wages, rewards, or taxes. It must be paid immediately.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>A paladin does not attract a body of followers</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">upon reaching 9th level or building a castle. However, he can still hire
soldiers and specialists, although these men must be lawful good in comportment.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>A paladin may employ only lawful good henchmen</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">(or those who act in such a manner when alignment is unknown). A paladin will
cooperate with characters of other alignments only as long as they behave
themselves. He will try to show them the proper way to live through both word and
deed. The paladin realizes that most people simply cannot maintain his high
standards. Even thieves can be tolerated, provided they are not evil and are
sincerely trying to reform. He will not abide the company of those who commit evil or
unrighteous acts. Stealth in the cause of good is acceptable, though only as a
last resort.
