Spells such as <I>charm person, command, confusion, domination, forget, grease, hold person,
suggestion taunt, web</I>, and other spells that make the target respond to the caster’s commands,
force an unwanted action, or render the target unable to act freely have only a
temporary effect in a duel. The affected character is unable to move or cast
spells—but counter spells are allowed—until the hostile spell is destroyed through
combat or a counter spell.

Duelists can never be compelled to leave the arena or perform unwanted
actions. Instead, control over their mental constructs are temporarily limited.
