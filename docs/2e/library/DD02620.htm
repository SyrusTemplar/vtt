Fighters, paladins, and rangers may apply their bonus language slots for high
Intelligence scores to any kind of weapon proficiency. Characters of any other
type can only use these extra proficiency slots to learn nonweapon
proficiencies. This rewards fighters who chose brains over brawn by allowing them to
compensate for shortcomings in physical attributes with the benefits of skill and
training.
<P></P>
Under this rule, the character’s number of allowed languages simply represents
the most languages she can ever learn. The character isn’t assumed to begin
play knowing any extra languages; instead, she must use nonweapon proficiency
slots to learn any extra languages she wants to speak. Characters can always speak
their native tongue without spending any proficiency slots.
<P></P>
Demihuman characters who are allowed to learn extra languages still have to
spend slots learning these tongues. Their advantage lies in the fact that they
can begin play with knowledge of these languages, because they had access to
people who spoke them when they were growing up.
