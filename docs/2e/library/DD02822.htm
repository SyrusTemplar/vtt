<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Keep paper and pencil handy to keep track of the troops on both sides.
<P></P>
Start by dividing the opposing forces into groups of a convenient size; groups
of 5, 10, or 20 usually work the best. If there is an odd number of troops,
make one group shorthanded. For example, a group of 35 creatures could be divided
into three groups of 10 and one group of five or seven groups of five. It is
best to keep groups of similar creatures together.
<P></P>
Assign each group an Armor Class based on the most prevalent AC in the group.
For example, if a group of 20 halflings included three leaders in chain mail
and 17 archers in leather armor, the group has an Armor Class of 8. If there is a
tie for the most prevalent armor type, use the worst one. Assign each group a
THAC0 based on the most prevalent THAC0 in the group, as above.
<P></P>
Once you have assigned an Armor Class and THAC0 to each group, you are ready
to begin. You may choose to roll for surprise, allowing one group to attack
unopposed, but after this combat is considered simultaneous. Assign one side of the
combat to be the attackers, and one side to defend. Line up attacking groups
against defending groups on a one-to-one basis. Each defending group must be
attacked once before any defending group can be attacked twice. For example, a
force of 60 orcs divided into six groups of 10 are attacking 40 dwarves divided
into four groups of 10. Two groups of dwarves are attacked once, and two groups
are attacked twice. The orcs can-t attack one group six times. Note that in some
cases only part of an attacking force can get into a battle. A force of 20
dwarves guarding a cave mouth might hold out against hundreds of orcs because only
20 of them can attack at a time.
<P></P>
The attacking group makes a normal attack roll. If the roll succeeds, they
will inflict one Hit Die on the defenders for each creature in the attacking
group, ignoring critical hits; however, do not remove any casualties yet.
<P></P>
Now, reverse the process, having the defenders return the attack, using the
same procedure. When both sides have made all of their attack rolls, mark off
enough casualties in wounded groups to account for all the Hit Dice inflicted,
leaving only one wounded defender. For example, if a group of 10 orcs successfully
attacks 10 3rd-level dwarves, three dwarves are killed and one loses a single
Hit Die.
<P></P>
Repeat this procedure until one side is killed or breaks morale. Apply
subsequent hits to wounded creatures first.
<P></P>
To save time toward the end of a combat, you can reorganize survivors into new
groups.
<P></P>
Creatures -killed? in a mass combat are allowed a saving throw vs. death if
they receive some form of healing immediately after the battle. These figures are
assume to be hovering at death-s door (see <A HREF="DD02457.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02457.htm">Chapter One</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) and can be saved. If there are a lot of casualties, roll the saving throws
in groups of 5, 10, or 20.
