<FONT SIZE="3">This spell transforms the caster&#146;s body into
living iron, which grants him several powerful resistances and
abilities. While the spell is in effect, the caster can only be
injured by blunt weapons of +3 or better value, or monsters of 8+3
Hit Dice or more. Slashing weapons, falling, crushing, and
constriction attacks of all types are completely unable to harm the
caster, although an attack may knock him off-balance or pin him
beneath tons of debris. Spells or attacks that affect the
subject&#146;s physiology or respiration&#151;for example, <I>poison,
cloudkill, enfeeblement, contagion, </I>or <I>pain touch</I>&#151;fail
completely, since the caster <I>has </I>no physiology or respiration
while the spell is in effect. Also, spells that have weight limits
should be applied to the wizard as if he weighed over 3,000 pounds.
The wizard ignores electrical attacks and saves at +4 against fire
attacks. If he saves, he takes quarter damage; if not, he takes half
damage. If hit with a <I>rod of smiting</I>, he takes 2d8+6 points of
damage unless the attacker rolls a natural 20. If this occurs, then
the damage is doubled.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">In addition to the natural immunities of an iron body,
the wizard enjoys powerful offensive abilities. His Strength score is
raised to 20 (+3 to attack rolls, +8 damage) for the duration of the
spell, and he can punch or bludgeon his enemies twice per round for
1d4 points of damage per blow, plus his Strength bonus.
Unfortunately, his movement becomes slow and awkward, so he is
reduced to a move of 3 and suffers a &#150;2 penalty to his
initiative rolls (or a reduction of his base phase by one step, in <I>Player&#146;s
Option: </I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><I><A HREF="corerule-page%3dCT_DD02411.htm.php.html">Combat
&amp; Tactics</A></I></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>). Most
importantly, the wizard&#146;s clumsiness and lack of breath prevent
him from casting any spells while the iron body is in effect.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Iron body may create additional hazards for the wizard
as the DM deems appropriate. For example, rust monsters are extremely
dangerous to a wizard using this spell. <I>Heat metal </I>spells
inflict double damage to the caster. And, naturally, the wizard sinks
like a stone in water&#151;although he could survive the crushing
pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the ocean&#151;at least
until the spell expired. Some magical items, such as potions or
winded instruments, may be temporarily unusable as well.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The material component for this spell is a small piece
of iron that once belonged to an iron golem.</FONT></P>
