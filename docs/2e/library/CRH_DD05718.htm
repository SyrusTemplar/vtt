<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Mountain Man</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Description:</B> Some people find the
lure of the wild irresistible. Having tasted the pleasure of life in
its purest, most primitive state, these hardy souls reject the
trappings of civilization and wholeheartedly embrace the challenges
of the untamed wilderness. These Mountain Men (and Women) spend their
lives in relative isolation, enduring uncertain climates, hostile
creatures, and chronic shortages of food and other vital supplies.
They couldn't be happier.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The typical Mountain Man is robust,
courageous, and uncomplicated. Book learning and formal schooling
mean far less than self-reliance and common sense. Though uneducated
by conventional standards, the Mountain Man has mastered all the
skills needed to survive. He can manufacture his own weapons from the
crudest materials, brew potent medicines from wild herbs, and
doggedly persist in strenuous physical labor when others have long
since succumbed to exhaustion. While hunting wild game and navigating
dangerous terrain may be daunting to an outsider, it's all in a day's
work for the Mountain Man.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Requirements:</B> A Mountain Man must
have a minimum Strength of 14 and a minimum Constitution of 15. The
Mountain Man cannot be a full elf.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Primary Terrain:</B> <I>Required:</I> Mountains.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Role:</B> Mountain Men value privacy
more than comfort. Accordingly, they make their homes in secluded
caves or crude shacks hidden in remote mountain ranges. Many are
nomadic, wandering from place to place with their possessions
strapped to their backs, or carried by a bear or other loyal animal
follower. They have little need for money, but occasionally procure
goods from traveling salesmen or small town merchants, bartering with
fur or hides.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the most stubbornly independent
Mountain Man hankers for human companionship now and then, which is
one of the reasons he might agree to hook up with an adventuring
party. Faced with a problem too formidable for him to tackle alone--such
as an encroachment from an enemy army or an infestation of powerful
monsters--a Mountain Man may seek out an agreeable party to lend him
a hand.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mountain Man speaks his mind openly
and directly, regardless of who he might offend. Etiquette is hardly
his strong suit, nor is personal hygiene. While some party members
may find the Mountain Man's straightforward approach to life
refreshing, or even endearing, most will probably view him as an
unsophisticated brute, gruff and ill-mannered. Some Mountain Men have
a crude sense of humor that compels them to play adolescent practical
jokes, such as leaving bear droppings in a companion's sleeping bag.
The Mountain Man has little interest in art or philosophy, but is a
natural storyteller and loves to tell outlandishly embellished
tales--often of his own exploits. He approaches combat much as he
does the other elements of his life, attacking with vigor.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Bowyer/Fletcher,
Fisher, Forester, Hunter, Miner, Trapper/Furrier.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> A Mountain
Man must choose his initial weapon proficiencies from among the
following: axe (any), bow (any), crossbow (any), club, dagger, dart,
javelin, knife, quarterstaff, spear, staff sling, warhammer.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonus:</I>
Mountaineering. Required: Hunting. <I>Recommended:</I> Alertness*,
Endurance, Fire-building, Foraging, Mining, Running, Set Snares,
Signaling*, Trail Marking*, Trail Signs*, Weather Sense. <I>Barred:</I>
Agriculture, Armorer, Blacksmithing, Boating*, Bowyer/Fletcher
(included in the special Weaponsmithing bonus, described below),
Charioteering, Engineering, Etiquette, Falconry*, Heraldry,
Navigation, Reading/Writing, Seamanship, Spellcraft.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Special Bonus:</B> The Mountain Man
also receives Weaponsmithing (Crude) as a bonus proficiency. He is
restricted to making the weapons listed in Table 47, and can only
make weapons in which he is proficient. He uses stones, wood, and
other naturally available materials, so these weapons are made at no
cost. This proficiency can't be improved; that is, assigning
additional slots to Crude Weaponsmithing has no effect.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>Optional Rule:</I> If a weapon made of stone or
bone scores a hit, roll 1d6. A stone weapon shatters on a roll of 1;
a bone weapon shatters on a roll of 1 or 2 (as per <I>The Complete
Fighter's Handbook</I>).</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> A Mountain Man
begins his career with any two weapons in which he has a weapon
proficiency. He receives these weapons at no charge. These weapons
are handmade. Once his career is begun, the Mountain Man may
manufacture additional weapons in accordance with the rules for his
Crude Weaponsmithing proficiency. He may also use weapons he obtains
from his companions or other sources.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A Mountain Man normally doesn't wear
armor. Instead, he wears a handmade suit of leather and fur which
gives him an Armor Class of 8. A Mountain Man often decorates his
suit with dyed porcupine quills or strings of colorful pebbles. He
sometimes adds bone necklaces, elaborate leather fringes, or a hat
made of beaver or raccoon skin.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Though not strictly forbidden from
wearing metal armor, a Mountain Man is so uncomfortable when doing so
that he suffers a -2 penalty to all attack rolls.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Species Enemy:</B> Any.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Followers:</B> A Mountain Man has only
a 20% chance of attracting human, demihuman, or humanoid followers.
Treat a roll of 81-00 as a bear (type determined by DM: usually
black, brown, or cave). Any followers rolled as full elves will be
dwarves instead (except for full elf mages, who will instead be gnome illusionists).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Special Benefits:</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Will to Live:</I> Where others would
submit to death, the hardy Mountain Man clings to life ferociously.
This ability manifests itself in the following ways:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> If missing a saving
throw vs. death magic would be fatal, the Mountain Man receives a +2
saving throw bonus.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> If a damage roll
would reduce the Mountain Man to zero hit points or less, the
Mountain Man makes a Constitution check. If the check succeeds, he is
reduced to 1 hit point. A Mountain Man cannot use this ability if he
has only 1 hit point remaining.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> If an encounter
results in the death of a Mountain Man, he may not die immediately.
If he makes a<I> system shock</I> roll, he fights on for another 1-4
rounds or until he suffers damage below -10 hit points equal to his
level, whichever occurs first. He then drops dead.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Brew Healing Elixir:</I> When a
Mountain Man reaches 7th level, he gains the ability to brew a
special healing elixir. He must spend 1-4 hours gathering the
necessary fresh herbs and mosses, usually available in any forest,
jungle, or mountain region (as determined by the DM). It takes an
hour to brew the elixir, which remains potent for 24 hours. The
elixir acts as one dose of a potion of healing. The Mountain Man may
brew the healing elixir once per day.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Special Hindrances:</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Limited Stealth:</I> The Mountain Man
has a -5% chance to hide in natural surroundings and a -5% chance of
moving silently.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Limited Magic:</I> A Mountain Man
lacks the patience and discipline to wield magic effectively. He
memorizes fewer spells than other rangers and doesn't acquire them
until he reaches 10th level (see Table 48).</FONT></P>
