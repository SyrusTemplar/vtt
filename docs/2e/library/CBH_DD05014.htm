As a role-player, if you can capture this performing aspect of the bard class,
you will have captured the essence of your character. Everything should center
around this aspect. The spells you choose should not always be chosen to
maximize your character's effectiveness in combat. Rather, they should make the most
dramatic impact upon those around him (including the adventuring party). Your
bard lives to perform.
<P></P>
Likewise, when you select your bard's weapons, clothing, items, proficiencies,
friends, allies, enemies, <I>etc</I>., you should try to examine these choices from a performer's point of view.
<P></P>
What weapon will compliment your bard's role as a performer, both on the stage
and off? What color should his cape be? Which proficiencies will make him a
more effective performer or a more memorable personality? Which spells produce
effects in line with your bard's persona? How can these spells be used to build
up the reputation of your bard? These are the questions to ask yourself.
<P></P>
Playing a bard can be a lot of fun. Play up the details. Add flavor to the
game. Immerse the other players in the fantasy of the game. You should always play
heavy on description and mood. For example, it isn't the success or failure of
an attack that matters, it's the way in which it is made.
<P></P>
As a player you are succeeding at your job if your fellow role-players know
the color of your bard's boots, what kind of weapon he wields, the name of his
favorite song (better yet, the words to it), the material components to his
most-used spells, the lesser details of his personality, his vocal range, <I>etc</I>. If they know your bard as if he were a real person, then you are a true bard
role-player.
<P></P>
To establish such a realistic character, you must have a very solid mental
image of your bard's appearance, personality, and mannerisms. For believability,
these aspects must be predetermined, consistent, and you must portray them
reliably.
<P></P>
Some role-players are skilled at establishing such a solidly defined
character. Often they base the bard upon a character in a movie or book that they know.
Others spend hours mentally developing their bard and getting to know him as a
friend. Some generate pages of notes to help them out. You can use any method
you like and the following section should help you out with this process.
