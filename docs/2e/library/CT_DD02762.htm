<P></P>
These lightweight, two-wheeled vehicles are usually open topped. They are
fairly quick and maneuverable. One to four large creatures can be hitched to a
single chariot. An animal drawing a chariot can pull twice its normal
(unencumbered) load at 2/3 of its normal movement rate. Each additional animal added to the
team either increases the movement rate by one point or adds its maximum load
to the chariot's useable load.
<P></P>
For example, two light horses could pull a 340-pound chariot load at a
movement rate of 17 or a 680-pound chariot load at a rate of 16. Standard movement
rates for fully loaded chariots are given in the individual descriptions below.
<P></P>
A chariot must stop immediately if an animal drawing it is killed. The driver
or a passenger must spend a half-move action getting out and disentangling the
animal and an additional half-move action or an attack cutting it loose.
Cutting an animal loose requires a knife or slashing weapon.
<P></P>
Although chariots are highly maneuverable vehicles, they are not as agile as
characters. A chariot must spend one point of movement to change facing. A
chariot cannot change facing in response to attacks. If a chariot changes facing
more than four times during a round, the driver must make a driving check for each
additional change or the chariot flips over.
<P></P>
Chariots function best on smooth, fairly level ground. Chariots must avoid
most obstacles; at the DM's option, chariots can attempt to cross obstacles less
than 2' high (or deep) at a cost of two movement points per square, but a
driving check is required to avoid flipping over. If a chariot crosses any terrain
where the footing reduces movement, the chariot must pay the movement penalty and
must pass a driving check at the end of any phase when it attempts to move or
change facing.
<P></P>
A chariot moves on its driver's base initiative phase.
<P></P>
A chariot has no cargo capacity beyond what its passengers can carry on their
persons (though passengers can lay their packs at their feet while riding).
<P></P>
A chariot can perform overruns as though it were a Huge creature; use the
driver's THAC0 to resolve the attack of opportunity when an opponent is knocked
down (see <A HREF="DD02422.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02422.htm">Chapter One</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). Chariots are treated as Huge creatures when resolving fire from bombardment
engines. A chariot occupies as many squares on the map as required to
accommodate the figure representing it, but never less than four squares in any case.
<P></P>
A chariot's passenger capacity, protective value, and other characteristics
vary with the type of chariot:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> <FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> A light chariot's car can hold as many creatures as one map square (one Large
<P></P>
creature, two Man-sized creatures, and so on; see <A HREF="DD02374.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02374.htm">Chapter One</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). If the passengers go into close order so they can fit into a car they need
not all have the same facing, but the driver must face forward. Man-sized
passengers in a light chariot can claim 50% concealment from frontal attacks.
<P></P>
An overrun attack vs. a Large or Man-sized creature with a light chariot
requires a driving check if the opponent is knocked down. If the check fails, the
chariot flips over.
<P></P>
A light chariot drawn by two light horses can carry two armored men at a speed
of 18.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> A medium chariot's car can hold as many creatures as two map squares.
Man-sized passengers in a medium chariot can claim 50% cover from frontal attacks and
50% concealment from flank attacks.
<P></P>
An overrun attack vs. a Large or Man-sized creature with a medium chariot
requires a driving check at +1 if the opponent is knocked down. If the check fails,
the chariot flips over.
<P></P>
A medium chariot drawn by three light horses can carry four armored men at a
speed of 18.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> A heavy chariot's car can hold as many creatures as three map squares.
Man-sized passengers in a heavy chariot can claim 50% cover from frontal and flank
attacks.
<P></P>
Heavy chariots do not require driving checks when making overruns.
<P></P>
A heavy chariot drawn by four light horses can carry six armored men at a
speed of
<P></P>
18.
<P></P>
<P></P>
A chariot driver cannot attack while the vehicle is moving, except for
swerving attacks (see below).
<P></P>
Chariot passengers get their full allotment of melee or missile attacks
regardless of the chariot's movement. Passengers cannot make melee attacks against
opponents in front of the chariot unless they are armed with weapons long enough
to reach those squares. Passengers make their melee attacks in the normal
initiative order.
<P></P>
If the chariot is moving during an action phase when a passenger makes an
attack, the passenger attacks at the end of the chariot's movement. If a chariot is
moving at full speed, any missile or melee attacks the passengers make suffer
a ?2 attack penalty. If the chariot moves at half speed or less, the attack
penalty is ?1. There is no penalty for attacking from a motionless chariot.
<P></P>
It is not possible to cast a spell from a chariot moving at greater than half
speed or from a chariot moving over rough ground at any speed. If the chariot
is moving at half speed or less, a passenger can cast a spell only if another
passenger helps steady him.
<P></P>
Any chariot can be equipped with scythe blades on its wheels and the front of
the car. A scythe chariot inflicts an extra 2d6 points of damage when making
overruns. If the defender is not knocked down during an overrun attempt the
attacker still can make an attack of opportunity that inflicts 1d6 points of damage.
<P></P>
A character driving a scythe chariot also can swerve, making his normal
allotment of melee attacks against single creatures in the car's flank squares. The
attacks are made during the chariot's movement phase and are resolved as normal
melee attacks except that the defender receives no Armor Class bonuses for
Dexterity or a shield and the attack receives no attack roll or damage bonuses from
Strength. If the attack hits, treat it as a successful overrun; the minimum
damage is 2d6. If a swerve attack inflicts a critical hit, treat the scythe as a
large slashing weapon.
