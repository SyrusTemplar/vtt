When cast, the <I>move earth</I> spell moves dirt (clay, loam, sand) and its other components. Thus,
embankments can be collapsed, hillocks moved, dunes shifted, etc. However, in no event
can rock prominences be collapsed or moved. The area to be affected dictates the
casting time; for every 40 yard x 40 yard surface area and 10 feet of depth,
one turn of casting time is required. The maximum area that can be affected is
240 yards x 240 yards, which takes four hours.
<P></P>
If terrain features are to be moved--as compared to simply caving in banks or
walls of earth--it is necessary that an earth elemental be subsequently
summoned to assist. All spell casting or summoning must be completed before any
effects occur. As any summoned earth elemental will perform most of its work
underground, it is unlikely that it will be intercepted or interrupted. Should this
occur, however, the movement of the earth requiring its services must be stopped
until the elemental is once again available. Should the elemental be slain or
dismissed, the <I>move earth</I> spell is limited to collapsing banks or walls of earth.
<P></P>
The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or
bury creatures; its primary use is for digging or filling moats or for adjusting
terrain contours before a battle.
<P></P>
The material components for this spell are a mixture of soils (clay, loam,
sand) in a small bag and an iron blade.

Note: This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead,
it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with
glacierlike fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock
formations, etc. are relatively unaffected, save for changes in elevation and
relative topography.
