<P></P>
This is a god devoted to man's communion with and honoring of his dead
ancestors. As such, this is a god of civilization and learning, even of courtesy.
<P></P>
The priests of this god keep the deeds of ancestors and heroes in the minds of
the population. They commune with and honor the dead, and are also devoted to
learning from them # not just reading their writings, but communicating with
them magically, even exploring alternate planes to understand the meaning of life
and death.
<P></P>
They are also devoted to the protection of new generations, whom they teach to
appreciate the previous generations of this race.
<P></P>
This priesthood places a high value on truth.
<P></P>
Priests of the god of ancestors <I>hate </I>the undead, regarding them as a mockery of true and noble death. These priests
seek to eradicate the undead whenever encountered.
<P></P>
Lesser gods of this attribute would be devoted to subsets of the broad field
of Ancestors. Such subsets include: Ancestors of a particular race, of a
particular city, of a particular extended clan; all male ancestors, all female
ancestors, all warrior ancestors, all scholar ancestors, etc. It would be appropriate
for a civic deity (see <A HREF="DD05535.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD05535.htm">Community</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, below) also to be a god of the city's ancestors, for instance.
<P></P>
Ancestor deities are not inclined toward either sex.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Birth/Children,
Community, Divinity of Mankind, Fate/Destiny, Race, and Sites. The priests of
this god dislike the priests of Disease.

<B>Powers:</B> <I>Detection</I> (as described in the Designing Faiths chapter) of graves and undead. The
priest can detect graves where remains lie, and the presence of undead, within 60';
he can tell the difference between the truly dead and the undead, but has no
other analytical ability (i.e., he cannot tell that the undead detected is a
vampire); through wooden or thin stone walls, he can only detect them at a
distance of 30', and through thick stone or the earth can only detect them at 10'
distance. (Therefore, when he walks over a grave, he will only detect its presence
if it is 10' or less down.) <I>Immunity </I>(as described in the Designing Faiths chapter) to the charm abilities of
undead creatures such as the vampire. Turn undead (same as the Cleric ability). <I>At 8th level: Prophecy</I> (as described in the Designing Faiths chapter); the priest cannot actively
try to prophesy; when receiving prophecies, he is hearing the voices of the dead
advising him.
<P></P>
<B>Followers and Strongholds:</B> The followers are received at 8th level, and consist of five third-level
priests and fifteen first-level priests, all of the same priesthood. The priest may
take the following on adventures: Five priests, no more than two of whom may
be chosen from the third-level priests. The priesthood will pay for half of the
cost of stronghold construction at 8th level. The stronghold must also act as a
genealogical library for the surrounding communities, and will constantly be
visited by scholars looking for information on families and ancestry (or who
come with information to contribute).
<P></P>
<B>Possible Symbols:</B> Tree.
