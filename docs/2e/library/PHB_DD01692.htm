<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="5">Individual Initiative (Optional Rule)
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This method of determining initiative is the same as that just given earlier,
except that each PC, NPC, and monster involved in the fight rolls and then
modifies his own initiative roll. This gives combat a more realistic feel, but at
the expense of quick play.
<P></P>
To players, it may not seem like too much for each to roll a separate
initiative die, but consider the difficulties: Imagine a combat between six player
characters (each controlled by a player) and five hirelings and henchmen against 16
hobgoblins and five ogres (all of which must be rolled by the DM).
<P></P>
Furthermore, each die roll must be modified according to each individual's
actions. The resulting rolls make every combat round a major calculation.
<P></P>
This method is not recommended for large-scale combats. It is best used with
small battles in which characters on the same side have vastly different speeds.
<P></P>
<P></P>
In the third round of combat, the DM decides to use individual initiatives.
Each character is involved in his own fight and there aren't too many to deal
with. Cut off from retreat by fallen rock, the trolls attack. The DM asks the
players their intentions.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Harry: ?Hit him with my hammer +4!?
<P></P>
Rupert: ?Chop him up.?
<P></P>
Anne (now in serious trouble): ?Cast a</I> burning hands<I> spell.?
<P></P>
<P></P>
Each character or monster now rolls 1d10. The rolls and modified results are:
<P></P>
Rath rolls a 2 and is attacking with his hammer (weapon speed 0 instead of 4
due to +4) and is hasted (-2), so his modified initiative is 0.
<P></P>
Rath's troll rolls a 1 and is attacking with natural weapons (+6 modifier) for
a total of 7 (1+6=7).
<P></P>
Rupert rolls a 2 and has a weapon speed of 7 and is hasted (-2) for a modified
initiative of 7 (2+7-2=7).
<P></P>
Rupert's troll rolls a 5 and modifies this by +6 for an 11 (5+6=11).
<P></P>
Delsenora is very unlucky and rolls a 9. Since she is casting a spell, she
gains no benefit from the</I> haste <I>spell, this round. She has a casting time of 1 for a total of 10 (9+1=10).
<P></P>
The troll fighting Delsenora is very quick and rolls a 1, modified to 7
(1+6=7).
<P></P>
The order of attacks is: Rath (initiative 0) strikes with his hammer. Rupert
and the two trolls (attacking Rath and Delsenora, all initiative 7) attack
immediately after. Rupert hits. The troll attacking Rath misses, but Delsenora is
hit. Delsenora's spell (initiative 10) would normally happen next, but instead it
fizzles, her concentration ruined by the blow from the troll. Next, Rupert's
troll attacks and misses. Because of the</I> haste<I> spell, Rath and Rupert now attack again (in order of initiative), Rath first,
then Rupert.</I>
