Inevitably, some campaign priests, including some player-character priests,
will see their followers as a resource to be exploited and abandoned for the
priest's amusement. For example, a priest might seduce and cruelly abandon
attractive followers, or might send soldierly followers into certain-death situations
in order to enhance his own glory.
<P></P>
If the faith is not an evil one, the priest is not following the dictates of
his faith and will eventually suffer for it. The first few followers who
perish or feel compelled to leave will be replaced normally. After twenty experience
levels' worth of followers have left in this manner, however, the other
temples of the faith and the local population will &quot;catch on&quot; and the priest will
find replacements slowing.
<P></P>
At that point, the priest will receive one experience level of replacement
follower for every two he loses. (This doesn't even count experience levels gained
by followers through adventuring. If a second-level guard-captain rises to
sixth level and then is wasted in this manner, he'll be replaced by a soldier half
his <I>original </I>experience level, i.e. a first-level fighter.)
<P></P>
If the priest loses another twenty levels through neglect or maliciousness, he
will receive one experience level of replacement follower for every five he
loses. If he loses another ten levels through neglect or maliciousness, he will
receive one experience level of replacement follower for every ten he loses. If
he loses any more through his misbehavior, they are not replaced.
<P></P>
That isn't the only result of evil behavior. The higher-ranking priests of the
faith will launch an investigation, assigning a priest of level equal to the
offending priest to his temple to conduct the investigation. If it is this
priest's conclusion that the priest has behaved badly, he could find himself
punished; he could have his temple taken away and could even lose experience levels
(if his god is offended by his misbehavior and decides to punish him).
<P></P>
Also, the other followers and the flock could become disillusioned. Surviving
followers could leave or even betray the priest. The local population could
gradually cease to attend the priest's church, and seek their spiritual
fulfillment elsewhere.
<P></P>
How long does all this take? That's a role-playing consideration. A priest can
be corrupt and hide his behavior from the faith and from his following for
years. If he does &quot;waste&quot; followers, but does so at a very slow rate, it could be
years or decades before the population catches on. If he's overt, and flaunts
his corruption or wastes his followers at a more advanced rate, he could find
himself in trouble mere weeks or months after first attracting his followers.
<P></P>
However, if the faith is an evil one, such behavior is normal. Wasted
followers will be replaced normally. (They are not, however, likely to be <I>loyal</I> followers, and may conspire to eliminate and replace the priest.)
