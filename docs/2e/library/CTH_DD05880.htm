</B> Beggars can be excellent spies. Their presence anywhere outside of the
higher-class areas of cities and towns will go unmentioned, if they are seen at all.
Beggars ply their trade everywhere, and some of them may just be sleeping off
the effects of drink. If one is hunched up against packing boxes by a warehouse,
so what? Anyway, no one wants to get too close to beggars. They have an
unpleasant range of startlingly contagious diseases, and approaching them is an open
invitation to lice to infest your person-just for starters. And, of course,
beggars are harmless (in the sense that they are too feeble, dim-witted, drunk,
etc., to cause anyone any harm). For all these reasons, well-trained beggars are a
real boon to the enterprising thief. They can get into places where other
people would look suspicious, they often go unnoticed, and they don't have a lot to
do apart from keep their eyes peeled. Just the people to have hanging around
the places a thief intends to rob. After the job, the grateful beggars can be
given a little percentage of the take.

Beggary can even be semi-professional, in large cities in particular. Dominant
beggars control lucrative patches of territory, where they know that pickings
are richest. Fit and able-bodied people, their senses undulled by illness or
drink, can pose as beggars for a better living (in a rich city) than they can
make by honest means (e.g., as farm laborers). Such people would make excellent
spies. A Guild of Beggars is by no means unlikely in many city settings. And,
since children make very appealing beggars as they look soulfully up from their
sad little eyes and beg for a penny for a poor orphan, such a guild will find and
train such rapscallions. The more talented (dexterous and/or intelligent) ones
may well be sold on to the thieves' guild, for a consideration, to become
apprentice thieves.
