Casting a<I> gate</I> spell has two effects: it causes an interdimensional connection between the
plane of existence the priest is in and the plane in which dwells a specific
being of great power. The result of this connection is that the sought-after being
can step through the gate or portal, from its plane to that of the priest.
Uttering the spell attracts the attention of the dweller on the other plane. When
casting the spell, the priest must name the entity he desires to make use of
the gate and to come to his aid. There is a 100% chance that<I> something</I> steps through the gate. The actions of the being that comes through depend on
many factors, including the alignment of the priest, the nature of those
accompanying him, and who or what opposes or threatens the priest. The DM will
decide the exact result of the spell, based on the creature called, the desires of
the caster and the needs of the moment. The being gates in either returns
immediately or remains to take action. Casting this spell ages the priest five years.
