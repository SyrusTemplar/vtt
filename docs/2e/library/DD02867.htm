Once a player character’s six ability scores have been established, it’s time
to introduce the Player’s Option concept of <I>subabilities</I>. Each standard ability score—Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity,
Constitution, and Charisma—is divided into two subabilities. These are more specific
definitions of what makes up a character. For example, a character’s Strength
score is divided into the subabilities of Stamina, which reflects being able to
physically exert oneself over a period of time, and Muscle, which measures the
raw power needed to force open locked doors or overturn banquet tables.
<P></P>
To determine a character’s subabilities, simply double the score of the parent
ability (Strength, Wisdom, etc.) and divide that total between the
subabilities. The scores for the two subabilities must be within four points of each
other. Only whole numbers are allowed, no subability score can be lower than 3,
and—with the exception of Strength—no subability score can be higher than 18.
Racial modifiers to ability scores are exceptions to this rule. Also, subabilities
can exceed racial ability maximums and minimums.

For example, Leon is determining the subabilities for his fighter. The
fighter’s six ability scores are:

Leon doubles the fighter’s Strength score (16x2=32), and divides the 32 points
as follows: Stamina—15, Muscle—17 (15+17=32). Leon records this on his
character’s record sheet.

Subabilities are used as the base numbers for many proficiencies in the <I>Player’s Option</I> system.

Subability scores also are used in place of the six standard ability scores
when ability checks are called for. For example, if Leon’s fighter wanted to lift
a large piece of fallen masonry that is trapping a fellow adventurer, the DM
normally would call for one Strength check to see if the fighter is capable of
lifting the heavy block of stone, and another Strength check to see if the
fighter can hold the block aloft long enough for the other character to crawl free.
Without subabilities, the fighter stands an equal chance of succeeding at both
attempts.
<P></P>
Using the same scenario with the <I>Player’s Option</I> system, the DM would call for a Muscle check (Muscle score of 17) to see if
the fighter has the sheer power to lift the stone block off his friend. Assuming
that roll is successful, next a Stamina check (Stamina 15) would be needed to
hold the masonry in the air long enough for his friend to move out from under
it.

The 12 subabilities are listed below, along with their effects on characters.
