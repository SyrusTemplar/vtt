The skulking burglar pilfering through the night is perhaps the most common
picture of the thief. Neither players nor Dungeon Masters should blind themselves
to other possibilities, some of them more useful (and socially acceptable)
than common theft.
<P></P>
The thief character kits introduced in Chapter 3 provide a variety of thief
types. These are not new character classes by any means, but the kits can help
players define thieves in one of several areas of specialty. Some of these
include:
<P></P>
<B>The Spy</B>, long a noble practitioner of the thiefly skills. Indeed, lockpicking, moving
silently, hiding in shadows, and the like are all skills of prime importance
to the Spy.
<P></P>
<B>The Scout</B> can do for an adventuring party what skirmishing troops do for an army: he is
a fast, lightly armored individual who can utilize stealth and speed to study
terrain and watch for ambush. Thief-scouts and rangers in combination make
splendid reconnaissance bands.
<P></P>
Other kits include the<B> Troubleshooter</B> (the dungeon-crawling thief<B>), Acrobats, Beggars, Bounty Hunters, Swindlers</B>, and many more.
<P></P>
Typical thiefly personalities are also provided, allowing players to create
detailed PCs based upon these archetypes, but also providing useful pieces of
imaginative roleplaying information for many long-lived, high-level PCs.
<P></P>
Chapter 2 describes additional nonweapon proficiencies of particular use to
thief characters. New equipment types, both magical and mundane, are introduced
in later chapters. And a few new rules cover areas of concern to thievesâ€”lethal
and non-lethal poisons, for example, and how to determine the quality of
workmanship used to build a lock or trap.
<P></P>
A section on running a thief campaign provides players, and most particularly
DMs, with suggestions and guidelines on ways to tailor the campaign toward the
thief PCs' areas of interest and expertise.
<P></P>
Whatever area of the book yields the most use, players and DMs alike who wish
to expand the domain of the thief in their campaign world should find many
things of interest between these covers.
