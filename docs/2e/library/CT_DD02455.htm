</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">If a creature is able to position itself for a rear or flank attack, it gains
a significant advantage. Flank attacks get a +1 bonus to hit, and rear attacks
a +2 bonus. A thief attacking from the rear can declare a <I>backstab </I>and gain a +4 bonus to his attack roll. In addition to the attacker
advantages, the defender's shield doesn-t help against flank attacks on his unshielded
side nor on <I>any </I>rear attacks. Last but not least, the defender's Dexterity adjustment doesn-t
count against rear attacks, since the defender can-t see the attack coming and
attempt to dodge it.
