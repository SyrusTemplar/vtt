Magical item research is discussed in detail on pages 84-88 of the <I>Dungeon Master's Guide</I> and needs little elaboration here. However, a few points are worth mentioning:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Laboratories:</B> The laboratory requirements for researching magical items are different than
those for researching spells. Spell research requires shelving, easels, writing
tools, files, and similar supplies, while item research requires test tubes,
beakers, burners, chemicals, and other equipment.
<P></P>
Consequently, a wizard who invested in a spell research laboratory will still
need to buy equipment to research an item. For example, assume that a wizard
just spent 5,000 gp on a laboratory for spell research, and now wants to research
a new potion. The basic cost for an alchemical laboratory is 2,000 gp (see
page 87 of the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00529.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00529.htm.php.html">DMG</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">). Since the 5,000 gp laboratory is useless for potion research, the wizard
must spend 2,000 gp for alchemical equipment.
<P></P>
<B>Libraries:</B> Just as a wizard's spell research lab is relatively useless for item
research, so is his spell research library. However, a sizeable library of magical
tomes probably contains short-cuts, hints, and formulas that will help the wizard
in his item research. At the DM's discretion, access to a sizeable library (say,
with a value of at least 74,000 gp) can increase a wizard's chance of success
by as much as 10 percent. Access to a library doesn't change the amount of time
it takes to research and create an item, nor does it change the amount of
money that must be spent.
<P></P>
<B>Specialist Bonus:</B> If a specialist is researching an item that duplicates an effect of a spell
from his school, his chance of success can be increased by as much as 10
percent. If the DM uses this rule, he should also deny a specialist the chance to
research an item that duplicates a spell effect from any of the specialist's
oppositional schools. The researcher's school has no effect on the amount of research
time required, nor does it affect the amount of money that must be spent.
