The ability of your player characters to see something and their ability to be
seen are important to the play of the AD&amp;DÂ® game. Characters unable to see
monsters have a nasty tendency to be surprised. Characters stomping through the
woods waving torches tend to give away their position, making it hard to surprise
others. For these and other reasons, you should always be conscious of
visibility and light sources when running an adventure.
