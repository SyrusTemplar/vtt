<I>The Complete Fighter's Handbook</I> follows all normal game rules for character alignments. Once the player has
chosen an alignment for his character, he needs to have his choice approved by
the DM; it may be that his choice will clash excessively with the alignments of
other characters in the party, so the DM is within his rights to disapprove any
alignment choice. (The chaotic evil fighter who wants to play with the troupe
of wandering paladins <I>will</I> be a problem.)
