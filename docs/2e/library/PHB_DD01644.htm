</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> One of the special properties of magical armor is its effect on encumbrance.
Although magical armor appears to weigh as much as normal armor, the weight of
magical armor applies only toward the weight limit of the character. It does not
apply when determining the effects of encumbrance on movement and combat. In
essence, the armor appears to weigh as much as normal armor but does not
restrict or hamper the character.

<I> Cwell the bard finds a suit of chain mail +1. Lifting it up, he finds it
weighs 60 pounds. Cwell is already carrying 50 pounds of gear. Donning the chain
mail, he is now carrying 110 lbs. of gear. Cwell's Strength is 12, which means
that he can carry only 30 more pounds of equipment. However, when calculating the
effect of all this weight on his movement, Cwell is considered to only be
carrying 50 pounds of gear--the magical armor doesn't count. Furthermore, he does
not suffer any combat penalties for the chain mail's weight.
