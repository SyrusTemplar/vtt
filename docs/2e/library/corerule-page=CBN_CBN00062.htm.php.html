</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Because of their affiliation with dark and terrible powers, certain
necromancers lose their ability to be harmed by mundane weapons. Such wizards, when less
than 12th level of experience, can only be harmed by magical weapons or
slashing or thrusting weapons of cold iron or silver. Necromancers of 13th level or
greater with this ability can only be harmed by magical weapons of +1 or greater
enchantment.
