<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Herbalism:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This skill indicates that a character is familiar with the uses of natural
plant products for good and ill. If a character spends a day searching the woods,
and makes a successful proficiency check, enough herbs, fungi, roots, leaves,
pollen, and pulp has been gleaned for 2d6 doses.
<P></P>
The most common use of these herbs is as an aid to healing; one dose of herbs
can be used in conjunction with the healing proficiency (by the herbalist or
another healer). This dose adds +1 point to the wounds cured by a successful
healing proficiency check. Even if the healing check fails, the herbs still restore
the 1 hit point. With no healing proficiency, the herbs can still be used, but
the herbalist needs to roll a successful check to restore the 1 hit point.
<P></P>
The herbs also can be used to create a poison, either ingested or injected. A
single use of poison requires two doses of herbs. The lethality or other
effects of the poison (paralysis, unconsciousness, delusions, etc.) must be worked
out with the DM.
