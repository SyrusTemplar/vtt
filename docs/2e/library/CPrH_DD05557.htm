<P></P>
This god brings revenge on those who deserve it, rights wrongs, punishes the
wicked, and avenges those who cannot avenge themselves.
<P></P>
Normally, the god acts through his priests. Priests of this god are approached
by those who have been wronged, and must learn what they can of the situation,
decide who's right and who's wrong, and take steps to punish the guilty party.
They must make the punishment fit the crime (a theft does not warrant the
killing of the thief in most cases, for instance).
<P></P>
Since these priests are often approached to punish those whom ordinary laws
can't touch (for instance, to punish a rich man who can bribe his way out of any
charge or punishment), they frequently have to perform their missions secretly,
so that the local authorities cannot learn of them. These vigilante priests
are not appreciated by local governments.
<P></P>
Lesser gods of this attribute could be devoted to only one kind of crime or
revenge. One might be the god of the Revenge of Spurned Lovers. One might be a
god of Lawful Trials, and must always go through the legal system. One might be
the god who punishes those who forswear themselves, and another a god who
punishes those who kill their own kin.
<P></P>
The deity of revenge is more likely to be female than male.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Competition,
Death, Fire, and War. (Individual DMs might consider this priesthood to belong to
Good or Evil camps. But Good sects consider this one to be too &quot;tainted&quot; to be
truly good, while Evil sects don't like the fact that this sect punishes the
wicked.) The priests of this god dislike the priests of Peace.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<B>Other Limitations:</B> Priests of this god may not refuse to investigate when the story of an
injustice is brought to them (unless they've already investigated this same
complaint). To do so is to constitute a &quot;betrayal of goals&quot; from the &quot;Priests and
Punishment&quot; section of the &quot;Role-Playing&quot; chapter. To investigate, find that there
has been an injustice, and then to refuse to act on it is a similar betrayal.
However, it is not a betrayal to discover an injustice and then take the time to
make sure the priest has enough influence and force to effect revenge; he does
not have to effect revenge <I>immediately</I>.

priests and six first-level priests of the same order, plus one third-level
fighter, one third-level mage, one third-level illusionist, one third-level thief,
and one third-level bard who act as consultants. The priest may take the
following on adventures: Three priests (only one of whom may be third-level), the
fighter, the mage, the illusionist, the thief, and the bard. The priesthood will pay
for half of the cost of stronghold construction at 9th level. In the
construction of the stronghold, its builders must include a courtroom and an execution
chamber or field (the method of execution is up to the priests).
