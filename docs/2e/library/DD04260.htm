This spell can be used in two distinct ways. The first is appropriate for
battlefield use. The priest can cast this spell on any unit within 240 yards in an
uninterrupted line of sight. The casting time for this use is one turn and the
material component is a gem of at least 100 gp value which is consumed during
the casting.
<P></P>
At the conclusion of this use of the spell, the target unit's morale is
modified by 1, either positively or negatively, as the caster desires. This
modification remains in effect for 1d4+2 turns.
<P></P>
The second and more powerful use of the spell requires lengthy preparations.
Casting must take place inside or within 100 yards of a place of worship
dedicated to the casting priest's deity. Both the priest and the unit to be affected
must be present. The casting time for this use is 5 turns. The material
component is the priest's holy symbol.
<P></P>
At the conclusion of this use of the spell, the unit's morale is raised by 3
(maximum of 19). This morale increase lasts until the next sunset. Only priests
of 10th level or higher can cast this version of the spell.
