<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Drums of Deafening:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This item is actually a pair of kettle drums about 1Â½ feet in diameter. These
radiate magic, if so detected, but are otherwise unremarkable. If either is
struck nothing happens, but if both are sounded together all creatures within 70
feet are permanently deafened and will remain so until a <I>heal</I> spell or similar cure is used to restore shattered eardrums. Furthermore,
those within 10 feet of the drums will be stunned by the noise for 2d4 rounds.
