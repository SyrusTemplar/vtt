<I> Description:</I> A Scout is a thief, usually solitary, who operates in a wilderness setting.
Besides working as a guide, spy, or saboteur for hire in the wilderness, many
Scouts are involved in such illicit activities as poaching.
<P></P>
The Scout kit has no requirements beyond those of the thief class.
<P></P>
<I>Role:</I> One might say that Scouts are to thieves as rangers are to fighters?but they
avoid the strict &quot;silly ethics&quot; of the ranger class. Scouts are not prohibited
from being good?and in fact they are, on the whole, a good deal more dependable
than thieves in general?but they have a cutthroat streak that can be dangerous
and unpredictable. However, their rugged individualism and harsh practical
judgement often endears them to adventurers, and many are found among such
steadfast, daring companions.
<P></P>
Unlike Bandits (who also operate chiefly in the wilderness), the Scout usually
shuns the company of other thieves, including guilds. The guilds, in turn,
care little about Scouts. Their poaching and small-time thievery is seen as
insignificant in the eyes of the great crime figures, especially when compared to the
trouble and expense that would be required to identify and to track down the
elusive Scouts, to punish them or force them to join guild ranks. If a Scout is
a guild member, either it is a voluntary arrangement (whereby the Scout
benefits from access to special equipment and training) or he has spent enough
&quot;professional time&quot; in the city or other explicitly guild-controlled territory that he
was &quot;persuaded&quot; to join.
<P></P>
Of the many Scouts not belonging to a guild, some have a single, consistent
employer. The rest are freelance or mercenary, serving themselves or whatever
employers may come along, taking the best pay they can find. Or, if there's
nothing else, they steal and poach to support themselves.
<P></P>
Several organizations employ Scouts regularly, sometimes on a permanent basis.
The military, in particular, does so; reliable Scouts, trained for
reconnaissance and sabotage, are vital to any successful military operation. And the key
to having reliable Scouts is to have well-trained and (most of all) happy
Scouts. A common grunt soldier can be bullied into line and, if need be, forced out
into battle by the spearheads of the rank behind him?but the Scout's modus
operandi is to explore alone. Maltreated Scouts have more opportunities to desert
or, worse yet, betray vital information to the enemy than anyone else in an army.
<P></P>
Military Scouts are carefully nurtured and well-nourished. They get decent
pay, excellent equipment, and the best training available for their special and
important activities. The training of military Scouts is at least as intense and
comprehensive as that of a thieves' guild. (Sometimes, after retiring from the
army, military Scouts go on to become the most illustrious and prosperous
burglars and assassins of the underworld.)
<P></P>
A few other groups that may employ Scouts are secret societies and other
paramilitary groups, thieves' guilds that have operations across the wilderness
(Scouts may bolster the ranks of a smuggling party, for example), and agencies that
are set up to connect clients with guides. Such agencies are normally found on
the edge of vast wilderness areas that are being colonized; such areas, with
frequent exploration by people unfamiliar with the region, have enough demand
for guides that an agency can prosper on its percentage of the guide's fee.
<P></P>
As mentioned before, poaching is also an activity typical of the Scout.
Animals may be protected by royal decree, written law, or the monopoly of a hunters'
or furriers' guild. In medieval times, for instance, hunting was typically
reserved for the noble classes. A commoner caught slaying one of &quot;the king's deer&quot;
could be punished by death.
<P></P>
But when demand exceeds supply, there may be great incentive for the criminal
killing and capture of animals. They may be sought for their meat, valuable
pelts, ivory, feathers, magical purposes (e.g., eye of newt), or other esoteric
ends. Thousands of animals in our world have been killed because some body part
was believed to be an aphrodisiac. In the fantasy milieu, there may be real
magical qualities, and the hunter or poacher's quarry may be fantastic. The horn of
the unicorns, for instance, may be ground into powder and administered with
liquid as a poison antidote.

<I>Secondary Skills:</I> Bowyer/Fletcher, Farmer, Fisher, Forester, Gambler, Groom, Hunter,
Teamster/Freighter, Trader/Barterer, Trapper/Furrier, Woodworker/Carpenter.
<P></P>
<I>Weapon Proficiencies:</I> Scouts have the normal range of weapon proficiencies permitted to thieves.
<P></P>
<I> Nonweapon Proficiencies:</I> Required: Alertness, Direction Sense, Tracking. Recommended: Alertness,
Animal Handling/Training, Animal Lore, Animal Noise, Boating, Fire-building,
Fishing, Heraldry, Herbalism, Hunting, Mountaineering, Observation, Riding, Rope Use,
Set Snares, Survival, Swimming, Weather Sense.
<P></P>
<I>Skill Progression:</I> Stealth skills are those favored most by the Scout, and members of this kit
have highly trained senses. Therefore it would make sense for these skills to
improve most rapidly: move silently, hide in shadows, and hear noise. Climb walls
also may see considerable use (though not from climbing walls, per se, but
trees, cliffs, and so forth).
<P></P>
<I>Equipment:</I> No self-respecting Scout will permit himself to go without a basic assortment
of wilderness survival gear: adequate clothing, rations, fire-starting
materials, etc. Special gear to assist climbing, hiding, and moving undetected are
also favored, as well as devices for hindering or diverting pursuers. (What worth
is a Scout's knowledge if he never reports back to his employer?) For a full
array of items, refer to Chapter 5, &quot;Tools of the Trade.&quot;
<P></P>
<I>Special Benefits:</I> Due to their extensive wilderness experience and expertise, Scouts gain +10%
on two thief skills when in the wilderness: silent movement and hiding in
shadows. Scouts also have an increased chance (1 in 6 better) to surprise opponents
in the wilderness, because of their stealthiness and careful attunement with
their environment.
<P></P>
<I>Special Hindrances:</I> While Scouts are intimately familiar with the wilderness, they are not so
comfortable in urban settings. In the city, consequently, the Scout suffers a -5%
penalty on all thieves' skills.
<P></P>
<I>Races:</I> The Scout kit is a good choice for many demihuman rogues, since those races
often already have an aptitude for wilderness adventuring. You may wish to give
demihuman Scouts a particular orientation according to their race. Elves for
instance, as natural forest dwellers, may have +15% when hiding in shadows and
moving silently in forested wilderness, and +5% in other wilderness settings. For
a dwarf, the special bonus may apply to hills or mountains, and so forth.
