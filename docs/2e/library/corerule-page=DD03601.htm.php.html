Severity
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Naturally, critical strikes cover a great range of severity. There’s a world
of difference between a <I>burning hands </I>spell cast by a 2nd-level wizard and the awesome blast unleashed by an
ancient, fire-breathing dragon. If the whole-body injury rules cover the size of the
attack, severity measures its intensity.
<P></P>
The best approximation for the severity of a critical strike is how much
damage the attack can inflict on its target. Figure the maximum damage potential of
the spell or effect, compare it to the maximum, unwounded hit point total of
the victim, and refer to <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03600.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03600.htm.php.html">Table 48</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> : Critical Severity.

<I> Terthan, the warrior from the previous example, has a normal hit point maximum
of 35 when unwounded. The </I>lightning bolt <I>was thrown by a 6th-level wizard with a potential of 6d6 points of damage (a
maximum of 36 points). Since this is more than Terthan’s hit points, without
being twice Terthran’s total, the severity roll will be 2d6.

Refer to the appropriate critical strike chart and roll the severity dice
indicated for the hit location. The result is the specific injury or effect
suffered by the victim for the critical strike. Unlike the critical hits of the <I>Player’s Option: <A HREF="corerule-page%3dCT_DD02463.htm.php.html"></A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="corerule-page%3dCT_DD02463.htm.php.html">Combat &amp; Tactics</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I> </I>book, critical strikes do <I>not </I>inflict doubled damage, and they do not allow the victim a special saving
throw to avoid the specific effects. After all, the target already blew one saving
throw, or he wouldn’t be rolling on the critical strike table.

<I> Lord Nonnach Redoff the Bold, a 20th-level warrior, rides forth to do battle
with an adult red dragon. The dragon naturally opens the fray with its best
fiery blast. Nonnach must make a saving throw vs. breath weapon, needing only a 4
to succeed. Unfortunately, Nonnach rolls a 1 and misses. Since the dragon has 17
Hit Dice, its victims suffer critical strikes if they miss their save by at
least 3 points and roll less than a 5—which Nonnach just did.
<P></P>
Chortling with glee, the DM rules that the dragon’s breath is a huge attack,
inflicting critical strikes in 1d4 locations; Nonnach rolls a 3, so he’ll get
three separate rolls on <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03598.htm.php.html"></A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03598.htm.php.html">Table 46</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I> and winds up with critical strikes to the abdomen, right leg, and left arm.
Now, on to severity: the dragon’s damage potential is 126 points, and Nonnach at
his best only has 109 hit points, so each strike will be rolled with a
severity of 2d6. In addition to the 79 points of damage Nonnach takes from the
dragon’s breath, he suffers minor injuries to his arm and abdomen, but his leg is
burned off at the knee! (And the DM could require him to make a saving throw vs.
death magic to check for death from massive damage, as described in the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01749.htm.php.html"></A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01749.htm.php.html">PHB</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I> .) All of a sudden, Nonnach finds himself wishing he were somewhere else
entirely.
