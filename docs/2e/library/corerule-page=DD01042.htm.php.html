<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Rug of Welcome:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A rug of this type appears exactly the same as a <I>carpet of flying,</I> and it performs the functions of one (6-foot by 9-foot size), but a <I>rug of welcome</I> has other, additional powers. Upon command it will function as a <I>rug of smothering,</I> entrapping any creature up to ogre-size which steps upon it. A <I>rug of welcome</I> can also elongate itself and become as hard and strong as steel, the maximum
length being 27 feet by 2 feet. In this form, it can serve as a bridge,
barricade, etc. In this latter form it is AC 0 and will take 100 points of damage to
destroy. Finally, the possessor need only utter a word of command, and the rug
will shrink to half size for easy storage and transportation.
