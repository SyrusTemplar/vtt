<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sword,+4 Defender:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This gives its wielder the option of using all, some, or none of the +4 bonus
in defense (improving his Armor Class) against any opponent using a hand-held
weapon, such as a dagger, mace, spear (not hurled), sword, etc. For example, the
wielder can, on the first round of battle, opt to use the sword as +2 and save
the other two bonus factors to be added to his Armor Class. This can be done
each round.
<P></P>
Note that there is also a <I>sword, +5 defender.</I> This is identical to the +4 sword with one extra bonus point.
