?? The most prestigious of all orders, the Radiant Heart commands respect from
the highest ranks of the aristocracy, who regard its members regarded as
dignitaries in their own right. The Radiant Heart honors not only distinguished
service, but what is perhaps the most remarkable accomplishment of any paladin-a long
life. Primarily a social organization, the Radiant Heart holds a lavish feast
every spring, held in the castle of a grateful monarch who donates both the
labor and the food. In their free time, members counsel younger paladins, serve as
government advisors, and officiate at tournaments.
<P></P>
?? <B>Requirements:</B> A candidate must be at least 40 years old and have the Etiquette proficiency.
He must have two sponsors: a member of the royalty of his homeland and an
active member of the order.
<P></P>
?? <B>Organization:</B> A chapter has 25 members. The order considers a new candidate only when one
of the members dies or voluntarily steps down.
<P></P>
?? A chapter's High Officers consist of three Prelates, each of 15th level or
higher. A Prelate must also have been a member in good standing for no less than
10 years. The Prelates make decisions by consensus, with suggestions from a
lieutenant called the Chancellor (a paladin of at least 12th level, also considered
a High Officer). When a Prelate dies or retires, the Chancellor takes his
place. The Prelates then appoint a new Chancellor. All High Officers wear a tattoo
of the order's emblem on their left wrist.
<P></P>
<B>?? Emblem:</B> A stylized outline of a heart.
<P></P>
<B>?? Motto:</B> &quot;The courage of one can change the destiny of many.&quot;
<P></P>
<B>?? Benefits:</B> A Radiant Heart member has unlimited access to all lawful good government and
church officials, as well as all lawful good aristocrats, land owners, and
other elite characters. He receives a +3 bonus to his reaction rolls from all
lawful and neutral NPCs instead of the normal +1 bonus. When he dies, the order
assumes financial responsibility for his survivors, assuring them a comfortable
income for the rest of their lives. The order supplies these funds from their
personal treasuries, or makes arrangements with sympathetic monarchs.
<P></P>
<B>?? Dismissal:</B> A member who violates his vow to the order, or commits an act heinous enough
to cost him his paladinhood, is beheaded. Should the member flee, the order
hunts him down.
