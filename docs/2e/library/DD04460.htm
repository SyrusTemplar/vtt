<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Amulet of Leadership:</B> This pendant or brooch bestows a character of any level the ability of a
9th-level fighter to attract men-at-arms. The amulet does not attract additional
men-at-arms to a fighter who has already gained his followers.
<P></P>
A fighter normally gains troops at 9th level because his name is so well known
that he attracts the loyalty of other warriors. The amulet works in much the
same way. When a stranger meets a character wearing the amulet, the stranger
perceives the character to be a leader who is destined for greatness, regardless
of the character's class. Just as the reputation of a 9th-level fighter spreads,
so the reputation of the person wearing the amulet spreads. Roll on Table 16

<P></P>
If the amulet is lost or destroyed, the followers immediately lose faith in
their leader. They gradually depart or desert. Once this occurs, the character's
reputation is sullied such that he can never benefit from the amulet again. A
fighter can, however, gain followers normally upon reaching 9th level.
