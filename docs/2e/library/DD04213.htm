Use of this spell protects the wizard and anyone in the area of effect from
damage caused by the rebounding of the wizard's spells. This includes damage from
a <I>fireball</I> cast in an area too small for its effects, a reflected <I>lightning bolt</I>, or any other offensive area spell that overlaps the <I>safeguarding's</I> area of effect. The protection is effective against spells of 7th level and
lower. The protection does not apply to damage from spells rebounded by any form
of magical spell turning. This spell does not protect the wizard against
damage from spells or attacks cast by enemies or other party members.
<P></P>
A wizard who has cast <I>safeguarding</I> is free to move and act normally. The spell's effect is always centered on
him, regardless of his actions. Other creatures are free to enter and exit the
area of effect.
<P></P>
An area spell cast by the wizard will take effect normally, but its effects
will be negated within the area of the <I>safeguarding</I> spell. This applies <I>only</I> to area spells centered outside the radius of the <I>safeguarding</I> spell. If the wizard casts an offensive area spell within the area of the <I>safeguarding</I>, the <I>safeguarding</I> is immediately negated and those within the area suffer full damage from the
spell. The wizard is free to cast non-offensive area spells and individually
targeted spells within the area of the <I>safeguarding</I>.
<P></P>
The material component is a piece of preserved skin from any creature that
possesses natural magic resistance.
