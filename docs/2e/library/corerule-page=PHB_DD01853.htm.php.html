When this spell is cast, the wizard can alter his appearance and
form--including clothing and equipment--to appear taller or shorter; thin, fat, or in
between; human, humanoid, or any other generally man-shaped bipedal creature. The
caster's body can undergo a limited physical alteration and his size can be
changed up to 50%. If the form selected has wings, the wizard can actually fly, but
at only one-third the speed of a true creature of that type, and with a loss of
two maneuverability classes (to a minimum of E). If the form has gills, the
caster can breathe under water as long as the spell lasts. However, the caster
does not gain any multiple attack routines or additional damage allowed to an
assumed form.
<P></P>
The caster's attack rolls, Armor Class, and saving throws do not change. The
spell does not confer special abilities, attack forms, or defenses. Once the new
form is chosen, it remains for the duration of the spell. The caster can
change back into his own form at will; this ends the spell immediately. A caster who
is slain automatically returns to his normal form.
