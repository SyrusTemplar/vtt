<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sword of Dancing:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">On the first round of melee this weapon is +1, on the second +2, on the third
+3, and on the fourth it is +4. On the fifth round, it drops back to +1 and the
cycle begins again. In addition, after four rounds of melee its wielder can
opt to allow it to &quot;dance.&quot;
<P></P>
Dancing consists of loosing the sword on any round (after the first) when its
bonus is +1. The sword then fights on its own at the same level of experience
as its wielder. After four rounds of dancing, the sword returns to its wielder,
who must hold it (and use it) for four rounds before it can dance again. In
other words, it is loosed to dance for four more rounds, going from +1 to +4, and
must then be held by its wielder at a +1 state and physically used for four
successive rounds of melee combat.
<P></P>
When dancing, the sword will leave its owner's hand and may go up to 30 feet
distant. At the end of its fourth round of solo combat, it will move to its
possessor's hand automatically. Note that when dancing the sword cannot be
physically hit, although certain magical attacks such as a <I>fireball, lightning bolt,</I> or <I>transmute metal to wood</I> spell could affect it.
<P></P>
Finally, remember that the <I>dancing sword</I> fights alone exactly the same; if a 7th-level thief is the wielder, the sword
will so fight when dancing. Relieved of his weapon for four melee rounds, the
possessor may act in virtually any manner desired-resting, discharging
missiles, drawing another weapon and engaging in hand-to-hand combat, etc.-as long as
he remains within 30 feet of the sword. If he moves more than 30 feet from the
weapon, it falls lifeless to the ground and is a +1 weapon when again grasped.
