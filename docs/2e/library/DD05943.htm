<P></P>
<B>Key Idiosyncrasies:</B> Tulmara suffers periodic blackouts, about once a month, each lasting 1d8
hours. She is wholly amnesic for what happens during this time. In her conscious
personality, her most striking feature is her dead-eyed, emotionless mask of a
face when listening to others.
<P></P>
<B>Cover:</B> Tulmara is well-known as a merchant, dealing in staple commodities. Cloths,
foodstuffs, and livestock are her major business interests. She has many people
working for her and is rarely seen herself; this is not unusual in her homeland.
<P></P>
<B>Guild and Leadership: </B>The Zazesspur thieves' guild has a traditional single-guildmaster leadership.
Tulmara's rule is strong, cruel, and despotic.
<P></P>
<B> History:</B> Tulmara Zir Bharann is Guildmaster of thieves in the city of Zazesspur, one
of the &quot;Big Four&quot; cities of Tethyr in Faerun (see FR3,<I> Empires of the Sands</I>, for some further details on Zazesspur). She rules tyrannically over a large
guild in this trade city, with some 140 thieves who are full-time members of
the guild.
<P></P>
Tulmara was born into opulence. The Bharann family is one of the older, more
important ones in Zazesspur, and Tulmara received an extensive training in
commerce and merchant life when young. Her naturally greedy and selfish temperament
was exacerbated by being spoiled as an only child, and made more strident by
this early coaching in personal greed. Her physical brutality, however, is
something of an oddball characteristic, perhaps a throwback to her
great-great-grandfather. Old Sulmair Bharann suffered fits of maniacal violence, but Tulmara's
brutishness is more coldly controlled. Her gauntlets of ogre power aid her
considerably in this respect; if she strikes or flails someone, they know they've
been hit! Importantly, Tulmara has never picked a pocket in her life. Such vulgar
street crime is beneath her.
<P></P>
Soon after poisoning her parents to advance her inheritance, Tulmara began
thieving. From her commercial work, she learned of the activities of other
merchants, and began to plan and execute robberies of their premises. Expanding into
blackmail and kidnapping, she was recruited into the thieves' guild by an early
paramour, Arkail Rhassan. These two became rising stars in the guild, arranging
for the old guildmaster to have an &quot;accident&quot; and then taking over the Guild
themselves. The Guild prospered, and became wealthy; the junior thieves and
apprentices, subjected to harsh discipline, could accept it if the rewards were
good. And they were.
<P></P>
Arkail was killed, murdered by an assassin; Tulmara has not been able to find
out why (it was on the orders of the Shadow Thieves of Amn, who feared the rise
of the Zazesspur Guild). Since this time, Tulmara has become more withdrawn
and harsh, more cruel and evil, and more paranoid; the killing destroyed what
little humanity remained in her. Now she strengthens the guild, and indulges
herself in a few big heists, to pass the time; her heart is empty, her zest for life
almost wholly gone. Her odd nickname in certain quarters?&quot;Cruelty's
Mask&quot;?comes from a middling-rank guild member who knew of her cult sympathies (see
below), contrasting them with the lifeless persona and deadpan facial expression of
his Guildmaster.
<P></P>
Tulmara is a devotee of Loviatar, and attends secret ceremonies and rituals of
that faith. She rules her guild absolutely, and she rules it through fear. She
respects only force and power in other people; intelligence, wisdom, and other
gentler qualities are held for nothing. She has the force to back her cruel
edicts, and while the Guild juniors suffer?and no few flee the land?the fear of
her is so widespread that she stays in control of her guild, at least for the
time being.
<P></P>
In Zazesspur, there are some notable political intrigues involving royalists
of various persuasion (see<I> Empires of the Sands</I>). Tulmara doesn't get involved in this; and allied with her guild's
predominant preying on outsiders and foreigners, this has allowed the Zazesspur guild
(and Tulmara) to grow strong and powerful without the authorities getting too
fearful.
<P></P>
<B>Tulmara in Game Play:</B> Tulmara makes for excellent intrigue adventures, and is a good nemesis figure
if crossed (paranoids always fit the bill on this count). It may take the PCs
many adventures even to realize she is at the center of activities they are
fighting against. It should be very hard to find her, even harder to pin her down
and overcome her. PCs might be terrorized by Tulmara's servants, hired to
recover someone kidnapped by her, paid to act as bodyguards or couriers who are
later attacked by thieves instructed by Tulmara, and the like. Tulmara strikes
ruthlessly at those who thwart her, and since the scope of her operations is very
wide, she can be thwarted in many ways!
<P></P>
The key element is always to make PCs work hard to get closer to the identity
of their nemesis. Tulmara's identity as guildmaster is known to few, and the
familiar working up the ladder from apprentices or thugs, to middle-rank people,
and then closing in on the heart of the operation should be the PCs' goal. Even
then, gaining any proof of Tulmara's activities should be very difficult.
<P></P>
<B>Tactical Notes:</B> Tulmara's own lair is protected by her<I> rod of alertness</I> (used as a magical alarm) and by her <I>censer of summoning hostile air elementals</I> which is used as a trap (opening a certain door causes a lever to fall, oil
to pour along a narrow channel and be set alight, and then the oil runs into the
censer, lighting it). Other magical alarms (<I>magic mouths</I> and the like) and numerous mechanical traps are present. A permanent <I>stinking cloud</I> in a corridor leading direct to her personal chamber can be bypassed by her
with the magical necklace she wears, but could be a problem for PCs! Tulmara
favors the use of many secret doors in her personal lair, below her private villa.
<P></P>
In combat, Tulmara always uses the sneak backstab when she can, but is not
scared to slug it out toe-to-toe even with a plate-clad warrior. With her armor
class and her magical gauntlets, she is a fearsome fighter. Her escape routes
(notably <I>oil of etherealness</I> and her magical cloak) are important, likewise her protections against
certain attack forms (the<I> ring of free action</I> makes her immune to <I>hold </I>spells, the <I>necklace of adaptation</I> protects against gases, and so on). Tulmara often spies on people in the form
of a bat, and the powerful webs she can cast from her cloak of the bat don't
affect her (<I>ring of free action</I>). Tulmara has a fortune stashed away in various business premises, and can
summon up a bunch of thugs to attack her enemies at very short notice, both
guildmembers and hired mercenaries.
