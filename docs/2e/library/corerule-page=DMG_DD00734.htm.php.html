<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Oil of Fiery Burning:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When this oil is exposed to air, it immediately bursts into flame, inflicting
5d6 points of damage to any creature directly exposed to the substance (save
vs. spell for half damage). If hurled, the flask will always break. Any creature
within 10 feet of the point of impact (up to a maximum of six creatures) will
be affected. The oil can, for instance, be used to consume the bodies of as many
as six regenerating creatures, such as trolls. If the flask is opened, the
creature holding it immediately suffers 1d4 points of damage. Unless a roll equal
to or less than the creature's Dexterity is made on 2d10, the flask cannot be
re-stoppered in time to prevent the oil from exploding, with effects as
described above.
