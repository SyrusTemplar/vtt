When a <I>power word, blind</I> spell is cast, one or more creatures within the area of effect become
sightless. The spellcaster selects one creature as the target center, and the effect
spreads outward from the center, affecting creatures with the lowest hit point
totals first; the spell can also be focused to affect only an individual
creature. The spell affects up to 100 hit points of creatures; creatures who currently
have 100 or more hit points are not affected and do not count against the
number of creatures affected. The duration of the spell depends upon how many hit
points are affected. If 25 or fewer hit points are affected, the blindness is
permanent until cured. If 26 to 50 hit points are affected, the blindness lasts
for 1d4+1 turns. If 51 to 100 hit points are affected, the spell lasts for 1d4+1
rounds. An individual creature cannot be partially affected. If all of its
current hit points are affected, it is blinded; otherwise, it is not. Blindness
can be removed by a <I>cure blindness</I> or <I>dispel magic</I> spell.
