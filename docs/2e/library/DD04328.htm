This spell is similar to the wizard spell <I>domination</I> in that it establishes a telepathic link between the priest and the subject
through which the priest can control the subject's bodily movements. There are
some significant differences between the spells, however.
<P></P>
Elves and half-elves have no innate resistance to this spell. Priest and
subject need not share a common language. The priest can force the subject into
combat, but the subject's attack rolls suffer a -2 penalty. The priest cannot force
the subject to cast spells or use any innate magical or magiclike abilities.
The priest can force the subject to speak, although the priest cannot inject a
full range of emotions into the subject's voice (everything said by the subject
is in a monotone).
<P></P>
This spell gives the priest no access to the subject's thoughts, memory, or
sensory apparatus. Thus, the priest cannot see through the subject's eyes. To
control the subject, the priest must be within the range of the spell<I> and</I> must be able to see the subject. Breaking either of these conditions causes
the spell to terminate immediately.
<P></P>
This spell requires a moderate level of concentration by the priest. While
maintaining this spell, he can move or enter combat, but cannot cast another
spell. If the priest is wounded, rendered unconscious, or killed, the spell
immediately terminates.
<P></P>
If the priest is 10th level or lower, he or she cannot force the subject to
perform particularly delicate actions, such as picking a lock. At 11th level or
higher, however, this restriction is removed. The priest could thus force a
thief to pick a lock. Any such delicate actions suffer a -15% penalty (or -3 on
1d20) to reflect the &quot;remote control&quot; nature of the action.
<P></P>
The material component is a mesh of fine threads that the priest loops around
the fingertips of one hand and manipulates in the way that a puppeteer controls
a puppet.
