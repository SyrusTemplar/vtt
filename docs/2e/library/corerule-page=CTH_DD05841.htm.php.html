<B>Guild Dues</B>
<P></P>
<P></P>
The most obvious responsibility is that the guild member must pay dues to the
guild. These will be variable. One guild may include training costs in the
basic dues, which will then be fairly high; another guild might not, charging for
training as and when the guild member needs it, so their basic dues will be that
much lower. Of course, if the DM doesn't use training rules in his game then
this element will be absent. When the DM comes to design a thieves' guild using
the system outlined later, this is a important element to consider!
<P></P>
In addition to a basic membership due, the guild may insist on taking a
certain percentage cut of the rewards the guild member gains from his thieving
activities. Here, it is likely that there will be a ``basic rate'' for normal
operations, with guild seniors considering special cases individually. For example, if
the guild provided the thief with certain important information which made a
big difference (and indeed without which a robbery would have been
unsuccessful), the guild may take a larger slice of the goodies than normal. What cut the
guild takes will again be variable. Some guilds may discount the yearly dues
(possibly in part) from later cuts from income.
