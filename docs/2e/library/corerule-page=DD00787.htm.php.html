<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ring of Delusion:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A <I>delusion</I> ring convinces the wearer that it is some other sort of ringâ€”whatever sort
the wearer really desires. The wearer will be completely convinced that the ring
is actually one with other magical properties, and he will unconsciously use
his abilities of any sort (including those of other magical items available) to
produce a result commensurate with the supposed properties of the <I>delusion</I> ring. The DM determines how successful the self-delusion is, as well as how
observers are affected and what they will observe. The ring can be removed at
any time.
