<P></P>
This god represents the fertility of beasts, crops, and sentient races. He
represents new generations of each species, defiance of death, and sexuality.
<P></P>
Priests of this god conduct rituals which are supposed to interest the god in
the fertility of the celebrants, their fields and animals. Through the rituals
of the priests, childless couples pray for children, farmers pray for good
crops, ranchers and animal handlers pray for their herds to grow fast and strong.
In addition to routine prayers, the priests conduct great, semiannual
celebrations (usually at the start of the planting and the harvesting season).
<P></P>
Lesser gods of this attribute would be gods of the fertility of specific
species or groups of living things; one might be the god of cattle fertility, one of
human fertility, one of elf fertility, one of wheat fertility. The god of
Agriculture could be considered a deity of one specific part of the fertility
attribute.
<P></P>
Fertility gods are as likely to be male as female. Those representing animal
life are more likely to be male, those representing plant life more likely to be
female.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with Druids and the priests of
Agriculture, Animals, Birth/Children, Earth, Elemental Forces, Life-Death-Rebirth
Cycle, Nature, Seasons, Sky/Weather, and Vegetation. The priests of this god
dislike the priests of Death.

<P></P>
<B>Powers:</B> <I>Charm/Fascination</I> (as per the Designing Faiths chapter, but never in combat, and only once per
day). <I>Incite Berserker Rage</I> (as per the Designing Faiths chapter). <I>Language/Communication</I> (as per the Designing Faiths chapter): The priest may choose one species of
animal with whom he can communicate, from the following list: Cattle, goats,
horses, rabbits, sheep, snakes. (This does not give him any control over the
animal; he may merely talk with it.)
<P></P>
<B>Followers and Strongholds:</B> The followers are received at 9th level, and consist of one fifth-level
priest, three third-level priests, and six first-level priests of the same
alignment, plus fifteen first-level fighters. These fighters act as guards during the
more somber of the god's rituals but participate in the more chaotic rituals. The
priest may take the following on adventures: One priest (it may not be the
fifth-level priest) and six fighters. In some sects, the fighters are all women of
any chaotic alignment, and they are called <I>maenads</I>. For others, the DM can substitute intelligent wood-beings such as satyrs,
centaurs, dryads, and nymphs, up to 10 HD of them, and they can accompany the
priest on woodland adventures. (Nymphs are identical to dryads with these
exceptions: They are not bound to specific trees, and can voyage in any forested realm;
and when they<I> charm</I> victims, there is no chance that the victims will disappear forever; after a
day in the company of the nymph, the victim can choose to stay as long as he
and the nymph collectively wish, or to leave whenever he wants.) The priesthood
will pay for half of the cost of stronghold construction at 9th level.
