Whether designing a campaign or establishing the parameters of a single
adventure, the DM will find it helpful to understand the prevalence of magic in his
world. Is magic relatively common-- are wizards encountered as frequently as any
other character type-- or is magic extremely rare, with practitioners
relegated to rumors and legend? Deciding how much magic exists involves not just the
number of wizards and magical items, but also the prevalence of spells, magical
monsters, and magical effects in general.
<P></P>
Here are a few of the questions the DM should consider when deciding how magic
fits into his world:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>How common are wizards?</B> The frequency with which wizards are encountered gives a good indication of
how often a party is likely to encounter magical items and spell books.
Obviously, if magic is uncommon, magical items are especially valuable.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>How available are academies and mentors?</B> A world with little magic provides would-be wizards with few opportunities to
learn their crafts. Advancement through the various levels of skill is likely
to be slow. Certain specialties may not be available at all. Conversely, a
world where magic is relatively common should have a variety of specialists of all
levels among its population.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>How are wizards accepted among the general population?</B> Are wizards feared or respected? Revered or despised? A predominance of magic
does not guarantee that the general population feels comfortable with wizards;
though familiarity can foster acceptance, it can also breed prejudice and
resentment.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Is there a relationship between magic and political power?</B> Wizards usually wield more power than any other group in a society. Have the
wizards used their power for political gain? Are they commonly found as rulers
and administrators? Does the general population reject the idea of wizard
rulers (wizards are too strange or too frightening) or do they embrace it (wizards
are smart and deserve to run the government)?
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>How integrated are wizards in the rest of society? Do wizards live openly, or
must they keep their abilities secret?</B> Are wizards able to walk down the street unmolested, or do they invariably
draw a crowd of curious on-lookers or hostile townsmen who regard them as a
threat? Do they live in a special area of town, or can they make their homes
anywhere they wish? Do they associate only with other wizards, do they mingle freely
with people from all walks of life, or do they prefer a solitary existence?
<P></P>
There are no fixed rules for the amount of magic available in a campaign
world, as long as the DM strives for consistency and balance. Following are some
general guidelines for several different types of campaigns.
