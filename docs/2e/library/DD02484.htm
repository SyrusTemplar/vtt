Characters can grab weapons or important items away from their opponents. If
the character wants to grab his opponent directly, he should consider it a
wrestling attack and resolve it as unarmed combat; see <A HREF="DD02679.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02679.htm">Chapter Five</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. A character has to have a hand free to grab; if both hands are full, he-s
got to drop something in order to attempt the grab. (Two-handed weapons can be
held in just one hand, but the character can-t attack this way.) The attacker
must announce the grab attempt before he makes his attack roll.
<P></P>
Trying to grab an enemy-s possessions while he threatens you is a bad idea;
the defender receives an immediate attack of opportunity against the grabber.
<P></P>
Generally, the grab attempt works the same way a disarm attempt does. The
character attempting to grab an item must make an opposed roll against AC 0 while
the intended victim rolls against AC 4. The DM may assign certain penalties to
the character attempting the grab, depending on circumstances; grabbing a tiny
ring on someone-s finger might incur a ?8 penalty to the target Armor Class for
the grabbing character. If the opposed roll results in a tie, the item may be
dropped or broken at the DM-s discretion.

<I> For example, Euserio the Bold is behind the evil wizard Warjo and decides to
grab Warjo-s wand of lightning. There-s no attack of opportunity, since the hero
wasn-t threatened by Warjo. The DM rules that there is no penalty to Euserio-s
attempt, since Warjo has the wand in his hand and isn-t paying Euserio any
attention. Euserio and Warjo make the opposed roll, Euserio against AC 0, Warjo
against AC 4. Euserio-s THAC0 is a 16, while poor Warjo-s is still a 20. Euserio
scores a hit with a roll of 18, while Warjo rolls a 12 and misses, so Euserio
gets his hands on the wand.

</I> Once the grabbing character succeeds in grasping the item, the opponents must
wrestle for control of it using opposed Strength checks. If a character only
grabs (or was originally holding) the item with one hand, then his Strength is
reduced by 3 points.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Continuing our example, Euserio and Warjo now struggle for control of the
wand, making opposing Strength checks. Euserio-s 17 Strength is reduced to an
effective 14 because he only got one hand on the wand, and Warjo-s 13 becomes a 10.
Euserio makes his Strength check with a 6, but Warjo rolls a 9 and wins,
jerking the wand away! Wonder what he-ll do with it next round?
