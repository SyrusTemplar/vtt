A character can also charge a foe. A charge increases the character's movement
rate by 50% and enables the character to make an attack at the end of his
movement. A charging character also gains a +2 bonus to his attack roll, mainly
from momentum. Certain weapons (such as a lance) inflict double the rolled damage
in a charge.

However, charging gives opponents several advantages. First, they gain a -2
bonus to their initiative rolls. Second, charging characters gain no Dexterity
bonuses to Armor Class, and they suffer an AC penalty of 1. Finally, if the
defender is using a spear or pole arm weapon and sets it against the charge (bracing
the butt against a stone or his foot), he inflicts double damage on a
successful hit.
