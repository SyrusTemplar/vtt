<FONT SIZE="4"><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>Five Incredible Locations</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">There are a vast number of magical places that are
rumored to exist throughout the world; a few of them are listed
below. Whether they actually exist remains to be discovered (and is
up to the discretion of the DM), but the search for any one of them
could be used as the basis for an adventure or a springboard for a campaign</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>The Island of Ghothar</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">This island is the former stronghold of the master
conjurer Ghothar. Ghothar mysteriously vanished several centuries
ago, and left the bulk of his magical treasures secured in a chamber
in the deepest recesses of his island. Not only is the treasure cache
rumored to be of incomparable value, it is also said to include one
of Ghothar's spell books, containing the formulas for many high-level
conjuration spells.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The Island of Ghothar is enchanted to continually
drift in random directions at speeds up to 25 miles per hour. There
have been no confirmed sightings in over a century, meaning that the
island conceivably could have drifted anywhere in the world</FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>About the Island</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Refer to Map 1.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The island resembles a cylinder about 50 yards in
diameter and about 165 yards tall. Nearly three-fourths of it is
submerged, meaning that only about 35 yards of the island is above
sea level. The island is made of granite; the granite is permanently
surrounded with a<I> wall of force</I>, making it virtually
invulnerable to damage.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The island is divided into five levels, each about 25
yards tall from top to bottom (except for Level 1, which corresponds
to the surface of the island). The floors are solid granite nearly 10
feet thick, permanently covered with <I>wall of force</I>.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The only passageways between levels are the magical
portals located at various points on the floors (see map). The
portals are 5-foot-diameter rings made of black and white pearls
imbedded in the granite. The portals are completely airtight. When a
creature or person touches the granite area inside the ring of
pearls, the creature or person is instantly transported to a specific
location on the island. The destination of each portal is indicated
in the Map Key</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Map Key</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Level 1:</B> This is the surface of the island, the
only portion that is visible above sea level. There is a portal on
the center of the island. Those stepping on the portal are instantly
transported to a random area in Level 2, abruptly finding themselves underwater.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Level 2:</B> This level is completely filled with
sea water. There are two 10-foot-diameter openings on either side of
this level leading to the open sea. Depending on where in the world
the island happens to be, this level could contain various forms of
dangerous sea life who have taken shelter here; such sea life might
include sharks, giant eels, or giant octopi.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>2a. Portal:</B> Those stepping on this portal are
instantly transported to the top of the island (to the area marked
with an X on the Level</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">1 map).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>2b. Portal:</B> Those stepping on this portal are
instantly transported to the floor of Level 3 (to the area on the
Level 3 map marked with an X).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>2c. Portal:</B> Those stepping on this portal are
instantly transported to the floor of Level 4 (to the area on the
Level 4 map marked with an X).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Level 3:</B> This level is completely filled with a
noxious yellow gas that smells like dead fish. The gas is so dense
that normal vision is reduced to 10 feet. Characters entering this
level must save vs. poison; those who fail suffer 1-2 hit points of
damage per round of exposure to the gas.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>3a. Portal:</B> Those stepping on this portal are
instantly transported to a random area in Level 2, finding themselves
suddenly underwater.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>3b. Portal:</B> Those stepping on this portal are
instantly transported to the top of the island (to the area marked
with an X on the Level 1 map).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>3c. Portal:</B> Those stepping on this portal are
instantly transported to the floor of Level 4 (to the area on the
Level 4 map marked with an X. )</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Level 4: This</B> level has floor-to-ceiling walls
of granite that divide the level into various sections. The walls are
one foot thick and are permanently covered with<I> wall of force</I>.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>4a, 4b, 4c. Fake Portals:</B> These circles of
pearls resemble the portals found on other levels of the island, but
they are not portals. Instead, when any character steps on one of
these fake portals, he activates a special <I>monster summoning III</I>
spell. The spell instantly summons 1d4 3rd-level monsters (selected
by the DM from his 3rd-level encounter tables). The summoned monsters
appear near the ring's perimeter and attack everyone in sight. If the
monsters are killed, they disappear; otherwise, they fight for 2-8
(2d4) rounds, after which time they vanish. There is no effect if the
monsters step inside one of the fake portals. The monsters will avoid
the real portal (4d).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>4d. Portal:</B> Those stepping on this portal are
instantly transported to the floor of Level 5 (to the area on the
Level 5 map marked with an X. )</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Level 5: </B>This is Ghothar's treasure cache. The
exact composition of the treasure is the decision of the DM, but a
suggested cache includes a spell book with a dozen
conjuration/summoning spells of various levels, five magical items,
and an assortment of gold and gems worth 20,000 gp. (Rumors abound
that Ghothar found the secret of eternal life and still exists in an
alternate plane of existence; if this is true, Ghothar might return
someday to restock his cache with a different assortment of treasure.
He might also change the traps in his island, especially if his
previous treasure has been stolen.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Those stepping on the portal on this level are
instantly transported to the top of the island (to the area marked
with an X on the Level 1 map).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>The Sphere of B'naa</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The Sphere of B'naa is located in a cavern beneath one
of the world's highest peaks. Its precise location is not known. The
sphere was created eons ago by a consort of wizards led by a
high-level mage named B'naa. The sphere supplied transport for the
wizards to alternate planes of existence. Because of the magic
involved in creating and sustaining the sphere, it is extremely
difficult to use and virtually impossible to use by non-wizards</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B><IMG SRC="coreruleimage-page%3dsphere.gif.php.html" WIDTH="550" HEIGHT="289" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></B></FONT></P>
<P>
<!-- $MVD$:spaceretainer() -->&nbsp;</P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>About the Spheres</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Refer to Map 2.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The sphere is located in an immense cavern at the end
of a 200 yard long passage winding deep inside the earth beneath an
ancient, towering mountain range. The sphere consists of several
layers (like an onion), each about 20 feet thick. The layers are
separated from one another by bands of shimmering white light. The
portal to the alternate planes lies in the center of the sphere; to
get to the portal, a person must pass through each layer.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Once the magical requirement for a layer has been met,
characters may pass through the layer of shimmering light to the next
layer. If any character passes back through a light layer that he has
already passed through, the magical condition must be met again in
order to re-enter that light layer. Characters may pass freely toward
the outer spheres (for example, from layer 4 to layer 3).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Each layer is permanently enchanted with special
features representing the various levels of wizard magic; for
instance, the first layer of the sphere represents 1st-level wizard
magic, the second layer represents 2nd-level wizard magic, and so on.
If the proper level of spell is cast on a layer, its features change
dramatically; these spells can either be cast on the layer itself or
on any subject inside the layer. Magical items that duplicate the
effects of spells do nothing to change the features of the plane, nor
do priest spells. The effects are explained in detail in the Map Key.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Map Key</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Layer 1:</B> This layer is filled with brightly
blinking lights of all colors. Those in contact with this layer must
save vs. spells or become blinded for the next 2-8 (2d4) rounds. If
any 1st-level wizard spell is cast at the layer or at a character
inside the layer, the layer instantly fills with <I>dancing lights</I>
and characters no longer risk being blinded. The <I>dancing lights</I>
persist for one turn, after which the layer reverts to its original features.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Layer 2:</B> This layer is filled with
greenish-yellow fog that obscures all sight, normal and infravision,
beyond two feet. Those in contact with this layer suffer 1-4 hit
points of damage per round (save for half-damage). If any 2nd-level
wizard spell is cast at the layer or at a character inside the layer,
the fog instantly becomes harmless, similar to the fog produced by<I>
fog cloud</I>, and characters no longer risk suffering damage. The harmless<I>
fog cloud</I> persists for one turn, after which the layer reverts to
its original features.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Layer 3:</B> This layer is dark and empty, but a
powerful <I>gust of wind</I> of about 30 m.p.h. blows from the inner
wall toward the outer wall, rendering man-sized creatures unable to
proceed to Layer 4. If any 3rd-level wizard spell is cast at the
layer or at a character inside the layer, the wind subsides to a
gentle breeze and characters can proceed normally. The gentle breeze
persists for one turn, after which the strong wind begins to blow again.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Layer 4:</B> This layer is filled with roaring red
flames similar to those produced by a<I> fire trap</I>. Those in
contact with this layer must save vs. spells or suffer 5-8 (1d4+4)
hit points of damage (save for half damage). If any 4th-level wizard
spell is cast at the layer or at a character inside the layer, the
flames turn green and no longer generate heat; characters suffer no
damage from the green flames. The green flames persist for one turn,
after which the layer is again filled with roaring red flames.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Layer 5:</B> This layer is solid granite, similar
to that produced by <I>wall of stone</I>. If any 5th-level wizard
spell is cast at the layer, the granite disappears, revealing the
bands of shimmering white light that border the final layer (Layer 6)
of the sphere. The granite reappears in one turn.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Layer 6:</B> This is a 20-foot-diameter hollow
sphere containing a structure made of shimmering white light. The
structure rests at ground level (relative to the cavern that the
entire sphere lies within). The shimmering structure has four
openings, all leading to a central area containing a golden chair. A
character can walk to the chair through one of the openings, sit
down, and instantly be transported to another plane of existence.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Opening A:</B> If a character walks through this
opening, he will be transported instantly to the Ethereal planes when
he sits in the golden chair. He will be transported to any specific
location in the Ethereal planes he has in mind; otherwise, he will be
transported to a random location in the Ethereal planes.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Opening B:</B> If a character walks through this
opening, he will be transported instantly to the inner planes when he
sits in the golden chair. He will be transported to any specific
location in the inner planes he has in mind; otherwise, he will be
transported to a random location in a randomly chosen inner plane.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Opening C:</B> If a character walks through this
opening, he will be transported instantly to the outer planes when he
sits in the golden chair. He will be transported to any specific
location in the outer planes he has in mind; otherwise, he will be
transported to a random location in a randomly chosen outer plane.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Opening D:</B> If a character walks through this
opening, he will be transported instantly to the Astral plane when he
sits in the golden chair. He will be transported to any specific
location in the Astral plane he has in mind; otherwise, he will be
transported to a random location in the Astral plane.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>The Sage Tree</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The Sage Tree is a huge oak tree about 10 feet in
diameter and over 100 feet tall. It grows somewhere in one of the
world's densest forests. The Sage Tree contains the spirits of a
dozen of the wisest scholars who ever lived. After the scholars died,
the gods of good rewarded their devotion to pure knowledge by placing
their spirits in this oak so they could engage in philosophic
discussions for all eternity.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">If a wizard locates this oak (recognizable by a slight
pulsation near its trunk that resembles a heart beat), he can ask it
any question as if he were consulting a wise sage for information
(the wizard can ask any question relating to the fields of study
listed on Table 61 of the <I>DUNGEON MASTER Guide</I>). The Sage Tree
will only respond to wizards of lawful good alignment, and it will
answer only one question per day.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">If these requirements are met, two to five (1d4 + 1)
human faces will sprout from the tree in an area five to ten feet
above the base of the trunk. The faces appear to be carved from wood.
One of the faces will politely ask the wizard to repeat the question,
then another face will offer an answer. Immediately, a second face
will offer a different answer. If there are additional faces, they
too will offer different answers.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">After all of the faces have offered their answers,
they will ignore the wizard and engage in a heated argument as to who
is wrong and who is right. The argument will continue for at least
2-8 (2d4) rounds, during which time the argument will drift off into
topics completely unrelated to the wizard's question. At some point
in the argument, one of the heads will abruptly ask the wizard for
his opinion to settle their argument--the head will ask for the
wizard's opinion on a subject totally unrelated to the wizards'
original question. Typical questions asked by a head might include:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> If a star falls from
the sky and lands in the ocean, should the star still be considered
part of the heavens, or has it now become part of the earth?</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> If a large animal
kills a smaller animal for sport, should it be held accountable for
its actions?</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> If two men share
equally in a business and one of them dies, should the widow of the
dead man receive his share of the profits, even if she does not
participate in the business herself?</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Are a wizard's
skills more important than those of a craftsman? Than those of an artist?</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> In what ways is a
dragon the equal of a man?</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">If the wizard refuses to answer the head's question,
all of the heads withdraw into the tree trunk and disappear. They
cannot be summoned again for another 24 hours.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">If the wizard makes a reasonable effort to answer the
head's question (the DM decides if the wizard has made a reasonable
effort), the heads will nod in agreement, saying they will discuss
the issue further at another time. One of the heads will then ask the
wizard to repeat his original question. The heads will consult
briefly with each other, then one of them will answer the question.
To determine if the heads have arrived at the correct answer, the DM
should roll 1d20. On a roll of 18 or less, the heads have answered
correctly. On a roll of 19 or 20, the heads have answered
incorrectly. The DM should create an incorrect answer that will be
believable and consistent with what they players already know about
the adventure.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">After the heads answer the wizard's question, they bid
him farewell and withdraw back inside the tree. The heads will not
answer another question until 24 hours have passed.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">If the tree is cut down or otherwise destroyed, the
essences of the sages will be transported to another tree somewhere
else in the world. As with the previous tree, the new Sage Tree will
be recognizable by a slight pulsation near its trunk</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>The Garden of Jertulth</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">This in a clearing in an uncharted jungle; its precise
location is not known. The garden is only about 10 feet by 10 feet
square, but its enchantment is so strong that it radiates magic for a
radius of one mile.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The garden appears to be a normal bed of wild flowers
of various types. However, if a non-magical weapon is buried in the
garden beneath three feet of soil and left undisturbed for a year and
a day, there is a good chance that it will change into a magical
weapon. No more than two weapons can be buried in the garden at the
same time; if more than two weapons are buried, the enchantment will
not work and the weapons will be unaffected.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">If a weapon is removed from the garden before a year
and a day have passed, the magic is negated; the weapon must be
buried again, and another year and a day must pass before the
enchantment takes hold. If a weapon remains buried in the garden for
a year and a day, roll 1d20 and consult Table 20 for the result.</FONT></P>
