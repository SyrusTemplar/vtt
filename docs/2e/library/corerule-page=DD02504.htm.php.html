Fighting with missiles or thrown weapons is an excellent option, as long as
you can keep your target at a range where you can hit him without being hit. Once
an enemy threatens an archer or slinger, it’s a good idea to either withdraw
or change weapons.
<P></P>
Regardless of a character’s size, using a bow, crossbow, sling, blowgun, or
firearm at its normal rate of fire requires both hands. Crossbows and firearms
can be loaded with both hands and then aimed and fired in one hand, if the
attacker’s size is equal to the weapon’s size or larger. However, heavy crossbows,
arquebuses, calivers, and muskets suffer a –2 penalty to the attack roll if aimed
one-handed.
