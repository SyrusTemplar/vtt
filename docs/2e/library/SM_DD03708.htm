This spell creates supernatural cold in the area of effect, condensing all
atmospheric and standing water into a thick rime of ice. If there is no source of
water or even enough humidity to support this spell, then the DM can rule that
the spell has no effect. The caster affects a cubic area of 1 foot per level to
a side, so a 12th-level caster affects a 12-foot by 12-foot by 12-foot cube
(up to a maximum of 25 feet to a side). This can have several effects; first of
all, any creature caught in the area of effect when the temperature is lowered
suffers 2d4 damage plus 1 point per level of the caster (or 2d4+12, for the
12th-level caster described above), or half that damage with a successful saving
throw vs. spell. Any fires in the area are suppressed and may (50% chance) be
extinguished.
<P></P>
Creatures entering the area of effect after the initial creation of ice suffer
no additional damage, although the air will be noticeably dry and cold.
However, the ice formed by the spell coats all surfaces and may cause creatures to
slip and fall. Any creature moving into or out of the affected area must make a
saving throw vs. spell or fall, losing their action for the round. The ice lasts
at least 2 rounds per caster level, and then begins to melt at whatever rate
nature decrees.
<P></P>
If cast on a body of water, this spell creates an iceberg of the stated
dimensions. A swimmer or aquatic creature could be caught in the ice and trapped
until the ice melts; most air-breathers will suffocate from this treatment, but a
few aquatic creatures (fish, amphibians, etc.) may survive being frozen, at the
DM's discretion.
<P></P>
The material component is a scale from a white dragon.
