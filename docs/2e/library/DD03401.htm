four elements—air, earth, fire, or water. Elementalists ignore the “normal”
structure of the philosophical school. Instead, all spells are designated as
either <I>elemental</I> spells or <I>nonelemental </I>spells. Furthermore, elemental spells are divided into spells of each of the
four elements. An elementalist is barred from casting spells of the element that
opposes his particular specialty; fire mages cannot cast water spells, air
mages can’t use earth spells, and vice versa. (Refer to <A HREF="DD03717.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03717.htm">Appendix 3</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> for a list of wizard spells by school.)

Elementalists enjoy most of the standard benefits and restrictions of
specialist wizards, but there are some minor differences. They gain the benefit of
memorizing an extra spell of each level, as long as it is taken from their
preferred element. An elementalist gains a +2 bonus to saving throws against spells of
his particular specialty (fire for fire mages, etc.) and inflicts a –2 penalty
to his opponents’ saves when casting spells of his specialty. Elementalists
gain a +25% bonus to learn spells of their specialty, and a +15% bonus for other
elemental spells that don’t actually oppose their specialty. For example, a fire
mage has a +25% bonus to learn fire spells, and a +15% bonus to learn air and
earth spells; he can’t learn water spells at all. Elementalists suffer a –25%
penalty to learn all other nonelemental spells. Last but not least,
elementalists research spells of their specialty as if the spells were one level lower than
their actual level.
<P></P>
Note that elementalists do <I>not</I> automatically add a spell to their spell book when they gain a level, as
other specialists do. However, an elemental specialist has the ability to cast one
memorized spell of his specialty per day as if he were 1d4 levels higher. This
affects range, duration, area of effect, and damage. When an elementalist
reaches 11th level, he does not need to concentrate to control an elemental of his
specialty that was summoned through <I>conjure elemental</I>. At 14th level, there is no chance for a summoned elemental to turn on the
elementalist.

While the elemental schools tend to be small, the elementalists’ abilities
generally exceed those of normal specialists. Elemental wizards of earth and fire
have a potent range of attack spells and can equal the firepower of an invoker.
Wizards of air and water tend to have fewer damaging spells, but have access
to better travel and support powers.

Elementalists can be used to portray magicians of unusual cultures or origin.
After all, the standard philosophical arrangement of schools implies a
scholarly, Western approach to magic, but not every culture or nation may have the same
beliefs or practices regarding sorcery. Many elementalists are much closer to
nature, or more attuned to their surroundings, than philosophical specialists.
