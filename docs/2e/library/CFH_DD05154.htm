Sometimes it happens that a character is created with a Warrior Kit and
circumstances later force him to reconsider his character's role. For example, a
Noble Warrior could become disgusted with the corruption and excesses of his class
and decide to renounce his ties to the nobility. Or, a Savage could become
increasingly comfortable with the civilized world and increasingly uncomfortable
with his savage kin. In such a case, the player should think about <I>abandoning</I> the Warrior Kit.
<P></P>
To abandon the kit, the player should privately tell the DM his intentions. If
the DM has no objections to the abandonment, then it will take place. Unless
the choice for abandonment were brought on by a sudden, traumatic event, the DM
may have to have some time to work the abandonment into the storyline. Often,
in the story, the character doing the abandoning will have to role-play out the
situation: Publicly renounce his ties with the others of his Warrior Kit, and
then suffer any consequences that might arise. (In Greek mythology, for
instance, the Amazon queen Antiope abandoned her former life to stay with King Theseus
of Athens . . . and she later died fighting her former countrywomen when they
came after her.)
<P></P>
Once the character abandons his kit, he also abandons all the special benefits
and hindrances it provides. Often, those benefits included free Nonweapon
Proficiencies or Weapon Proficiencies. The character doesn't <I>lose </I>those, but he <I>must</I> pay for them from the next free slots he has available to him.
<P></P>
The character may not take another Warrior Kit to replace the one he's
abandoned. Once he gives up his Warrior Kit, he's an ordinary Fighter, Paladin, or
Ranger for the rest of his playing life.
