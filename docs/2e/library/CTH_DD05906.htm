The DM should have a reasonable idea of how many people live in the town or
city where the thieves' guild is located. Most sourcepacks give such figures, and
if the DM has designed his own campaign world then he should ascribe a
suitable figure. For DMs uncertain about this, in medieval times only capital cities
in Europe had a six-figure total of inhabitants, and many villages and hamlets
had but a few score. Prosperous major towns would have in the order of 4-10,000
or so, and important cities perhaps 20-60,000 (depending on which century is
taken for reference). There is no need for the DM to be ultra-accurate, but
population will greatly affect the number of thieves in the guild, so the DM should
record this.
