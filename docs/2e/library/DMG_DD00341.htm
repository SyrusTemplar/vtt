Third, a character can research a spell using a scroll with the same spell as
a base. The time and cost required for the research is half normal and the
player character must still check to see if he can learn the spell. Regardless of
the success or failure of the research, the scroll is destroyed--the wizard had
to read it aloud to analyze its effects.

Scroll research cannot be done in an adventuring situation. The wizard must
have carefully controlled conditions even to attempt it.
