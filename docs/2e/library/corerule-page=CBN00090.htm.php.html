With this versatile spell, a wizard establishes a sensory link between him- or
herself and a corpse or freshly animated zombie of a human, demihuman, or
humanoid within the spell’s range. This link allows the caster to gather sensory
information from the vicinity of the cadaver or undead being. For every three
levels of experience past the 1st, the wizard gains the ability to collect
information from an additional sense via the corpse link. At 4th level, for instance,
the wizard may choose up to two senses (up to three at 7th level, four at 10th
level, and all five at 13th level).
<P></P>
<I>Sight: </I>The caster can see what the corpse or undead creature sees as if looking
through one of the creature’s eyes.
<P></P>
<I>Sound:</I> The wizard can now hear through one ear, exactly as if standing at the
corpse’s current location (if a wizard/thief, the caster can use his or her hear
noise ability too).
<P></P>
<I>Smell:</I> With one nostril, the wizard can now smell things exactly as if standing at
the corpse’s current location. The spell conveniently masks the putrefying
stench of the cadaver (if any) so that subtle variations of aroma (like the scent of
a rose) can easily be detected.
<P></P>
<I>Taste:</I> The caster can taste any substance which is introduced into the corpse’s
mouth. The substance (which may be solid or liquid) tastes exactly as if the wizard
had placed it on one side of his or her own tongue. This can be especially
useful when checking for poison in food or identifying unknown potions.
Thankfully, the taste of the corpse’s own rotting flesh can be masked out by the spell.
<P></P>
<I>Touch: </I>The caster gains the ability to sense the textural and environmental
conditions, with a single hand, as if standing at the corpse’s location. The wizard can
gauge the surface texture and temperature of any object or substance which is
placed in contact with the corresponding hand of the corpse.
<P></P>
The type and number of sensory signals is chosen by the wizard at the time of
casting, and cannot be changed for the duration of the spell. The caster
collects all the sensory information through a single organ (eye, ear, nostril, half
of the tongue, or hand) belonging to the corpse or undead recipient. <I>This organ need not be attached to the rest of the cadaver for the spell to
function properly.
<P></P>
</I> While the spell is in effect, the wizard can still see/hear/smell/taste/touch
normally through other (unlinked) organs. For example, a necromancer harvests
the left eye from a fresh cadaver (with a successful Anatomy ability check) and
places it on a high ledge, with a strategic view of a front door. If the spell
is now cast, the wizard’s left eye would be able to see through the left eye of
the corpse and spy on any visitors, while his or her right eye remains normal.
<P></P>
Furthermore, if the target of the spell is a zombie, the magic enables the
caster to issue simple commands to the undead creature via this link. The commands
can be no longer than four words and can deal only with the creature’s
movement (turn left, walk forward two steps, and so on) If either the caster or the
undead creature moves beyond the range of the spell, the effects are negated. <I>Corpse link</I> does not impart any animation to dead tissue; if cast on a regular cadaver,
it remains stationary for the duration of the spell.
<P></P>
The material component is a fresh corpse or a newly-animated zombie. Unless
some form of preservative magic has been employed to protect the corpse’s
decaying sensory organs (such as <I>embalm</I> or <I>spirit bind</I>), this spell cannot be employed on the remains of one who has been dead for
longer than 1 day per level of the caster. This spell also requires the
appropriate sensory organ of an animal or monster noted for its keen senses (such as
the eyes of a hawk, ear of a rabbit, snout of a pig, and so on).
