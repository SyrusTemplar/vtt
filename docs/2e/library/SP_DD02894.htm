<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Elves</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Elves tend to be taller than dwarves, and shorter and slimmer than humans.
Their features are angular and finely chiseled, and although elves may appear
thin and weak, they are actually quick and strong. When circumstances dictate,
elves can be fierce warriors, taking any steps necessary to protect themselves,
their homes, and their friends. Most elves are between 5 and 5 1/2' tall and
weigh about 110 pounds. They prefer to live in natural settings such as secluded
forests and groves. They are chaotic by nature, and other races sometimes
consider elves frivolous and aloof.
<P></P>
Elves are an extremely long-lived race, averaging about 1,200 years. This may
explain some of their attitudes-life is to be taken slowly and enjoyed; never
rush about to accomplish things; there is plenty of time for all activities.
Elves enjoy singing, dancing, and looking for the natural beauty in everything
they see.
<P></P>
Perhaps because they live so long, elves find it difficult to make friends
with the shorter-lived races. Some elves don-t want to bother getting close to
humans when those friends will die of old age so soon. However, elves who do make
friends outside their race treat their comrades as equals. Friends-and
enemies-are never forgotten.
<P></P>
Elves are fascinated by magic and devote time and energy to studying arcane
forces. Even powerful human mages respect and admire elves? understanding of
magic.
<P></P>
The standard elven subraces are: <A HREF="DD02894.htm#51237ede"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02894.htm#51237ede">aquatic</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, <A HREF="DD02894.htm#8513c43e"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02894.htm#8513c43e">dark</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, <A HREF="DD02894.htm#6db1597b"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02894.htm#6db1597b">gray</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, <A HREF="DD02894.htm#c12b7d36"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02894.htm#c12b7d36">high</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, and <A HREF="DD02894.htm#3dd58451"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02894.htm#3dd58451">wood</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.

fighter/mage, fighter/thief, fighter/mage/thief, or mage/thief.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B>Character point cost: 40
<P></P>
</B>Aquatic elves, also called sea elves, live in oceans, lagoons, inlets, bays,
and other bodies of salt water. They patrol the shallows and depths and rule
from their courts of living coral. Though not often seen, when they are
encountered it is common to find dolphins among them.
<P></P>
Aquatic elves serve to keep the evil inhabitants of the depths in check.
Sahuagin are particularly hated foes, as are sharks that are large enough to
threaten sea folk.
<P></P>
Skin colors vary from silver-green to pale blue. Hair is usually green or
blue-green, matching the kelp beds where most sea elves make their homes. Their
coloring helps conceal the elves from their natural predators. Aquatic elves have
gill slits like fish, and they process the air they need out of the water.
Unlike most fish, aquatic elves can live for some time out of water.
<P></P>
Aquatic elves can move about on land for a number of days equal to their
Fitness scores. However, the longer they spend out of water, the weaker they become.
For every two days spent out of the water, aquatic elves suffer a ?1 penalty
to all ability scores, and to proficiency checks and attack and damage rolls. If
any ability or subability score reaches zero, the elf dies. Weakened elves
recover within two turns when they return to salt water. Elves who enter fresh
water do not recover, but the process of dehydration halts. Aquatic elves can stay
in fresh water indefinitely. However, if an aquatic elf leaves fresh water,
the dehydration process starts again.
<P></P>
Most aquatic elves are chaotic good, but player characters can be any
alignment.
<P></P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B>Character point cost: 45
<P></P>
</B>The dark elves, also known as drow, live underground. Nearly all of them are
evil, and they have used their cunning to become masters of much of the
Underdark. Most intelligent creatures shun them. In many ways, dark elves are the
twisted, corrupt versions of their above-ground relatives.
<P></P>
Drow have jet black skin, the better to hide their movements underground. And
they tend to be shorter than other elves. The only other physical difference
drow exhibit is their eyes, which glow a feral red-evidence, perhaps, of the
hatred that burns in their hearts and minds.
<P></P>
Very few dark elves are of good alignment, and these are usually player
characters.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B>Character point cost: 45
<P></P>
</B>Gray elves are considered the most noble and reclusive of elvenkind, devoting
time to improving their minds. Also known as the faerie, this race has
withdrawn from the world around them, stepping forth only to combat great evils. To
some-even other elves-this retiring nature makes gray elves seem aloof and
uncaring. Indeed, the faerie can be haughty, disdaining contact with their cousins and
considering themselves to be the highest, purest, most noble form of elf.
<P></P>
Tall and slender, gray elves have amber or violet eyes and silver or pale
golden hair. They prefer to dress in white, silver, or golden yellow with cloaks of
dark tones such as deep blue or purple.
<P></P>
Most gray elves are chaotic good, though player characters can be any
alignment.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B>Character point cost: 40
<P></P>
</B>The most common type of elf, these are also the most open, friendly, and
cooperative. High elves set the physical standards for elves, being about 5' tall
and weighing about 110 pounds. High elves are the palest of all elves, with a
skin tone resembling the color of fine cream. High elves usually have blond hair
and blue eyes or darker hair, ranging from sandy brown to jet black, with
intensely green eyes. High elves like to wear pastel shades. When out on a hunt or
adventuring in the forest, high elves typically cover themselves in a cloak of
forest green in the spring and summer and one of tan or russet in the autumn.
<P></P>
Most high elves are chaotic good, though as player characters they can be any
alignment.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Languages:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> High elves begin with high elf, common, elf, gnome, halfling, goblin,

<A NAME="3dd58451"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Sylvan (Wood) Elves
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B>Character point cost: 40
<P></P>
</B>Sylvan elves, or wood elves as they also are known, descended from the same
stock as other elves. However, they prefer to live a more primitive lifestyle,
more in touch with their roots in the primeval forests they have made their
homes. They are geared toward simple survival, and they concentrate on their
environment rather than on philosophical debates and the study of magic. Sylvan elves
enjoy the beauty of a singing bird, the patterns of an intricate spider web,
and their own practice of tattooing. They are the most temperamental and
emotional elves.
<P></P>
Sylvan elves are more muscular than other elves, and their complexions are
darker. They have yellow to coppery-red hair and brown eyes, though some rare
cases of hazel or blue eyes are known. Any sylvan elf born with hazel or blue eyes
is considered a good omen for the tribe, believed to be destined for personal
greatness. Sylvan elves normally dress in browns and greens, the better to blend
in with the forest.
<P></P>
Unlike most of their brethren, sylvan elves tend toward neutral alignments,
though player characters can be of any alignment.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Languages:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Sylvan elves begin with their own dialect, in addition to elf, centaur,
pixie, dryad, treant, and brownie. Sylvan elves rarely learn the common tongue, as
they wish to have as little to do with the outside world as possible.
