The course of study varies from academy to academy, but most include the
classes described below. Usually, all of these classes are required to graduate, but
the DM might decide to vary them according to the needs of a specific student
or the educational philosophy of a particular faculty. The length of time necessary to graduate also varies from school to school,
depending on the student's aptitude, the intensity of the training, and the
quality of the faculty, but generally, four to six years of full-time study are
required to graduate from an accredited academy. This period can be lengthened by
as much as two to four additional years if the student specializes in a
particular school.
<P></P>
A student usually takes four to six courses per quarter, with each quarter
lasting three months. A minor course, such as Survey of Literature, might last
only a single quarter, while a major course, such as Spell Tutorial, might be
taken every quarter until the student graduates. An average course lasts one to two
hours per day, four to six days per week.
