This character is like a grown-up version of the Earnest Novice. He knows what
the world is all about, but he intends to do his temple's business and see to
it that his god's goals are met, with no complaints and no back-talk. He's a
combination of cheerleader and drill sergeant. He leads by example, and he
usually leads. He gets to know the minds of his companions and plays upon their own
goals and desires to get his accomplished. This doesn't make him a villain like
the Hypocrite; he probably intends this to be to everyone's benefit.
<P></P>
Like the Crusader, he performs best when he's headed in the direction of his
personal goal; unlike the Crusader, he doesn't have just one goal that dominates
his life, and can add the other player-characters' goals to their own. (But if
he does take on someone else's goal, you can be sure that he'll be unceasing
and maybe unbearable in trying to motivate that character toward that goal. He
won't let the other character abandon the goal. He just never gives up.)
<P></P>
This character is suited to any alignment. Obviously, if he's lawful good, his
goals will be the goals of his god and his society; if he's chaotic evil, his
goals will be his own, and very destructive ones, too.
<P></P>
In combat situations, the Motivator charges into the thick of things and tries
to whip up his allies into a combat frenzy. He gravitates to the center of the
skirmish line, and if he's fit for it will try to take on the biggest and
baddest opponents.
<P></P>
In role-playing situations, he'll be a vigorous font of advice and
helpfulness. He tends to be abrupt of speech and firmly set in his opinions (i.e.,
stubborn), but he's usually a good friend to have around.
