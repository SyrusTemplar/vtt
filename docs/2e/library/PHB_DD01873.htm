The <I>knock</I> spell opens stuck, barred, locked, held, or wizard-locked doors. It opens
secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens
welds, shackles, or chains. If used to open a wizard-locked door, the spell
does not remove the former spell, but simply suspends its functioning for one
turn. In all other cases, it permanently opens locks or welds--although the former
could be closed and locked again later. It does not raise barred gates or
similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the
like. Note that the effect is limited by the area; a 3rd-level wizard can cast
a <I>knock</I> spell on a door of 30 square feet or less (for example, a standard 4-ft. x
7-ft. door). Each spell can undo up to two means of preventing egress through a
portal. Thus if a door is locked, barred, and held, or triple locked, opening it
requires two <I>knock</I> spells. In all cases, the location of the door or item must be known--the
spell cannot be used against a wall in hopes of discovering a secret door.
<P></P>
The reverse spell, <I>lock</I>, closes and locks a door or similar closure, provided there is a physical
mechanism. It does not create a weld, but it locks physically operated locking
mechanisms, set bars, and so on, up to two functions. It cannot affect a
portcullis.
