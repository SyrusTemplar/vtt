<I>Otiluke's Freezing Sphere</I> is a multipurpose spell of considerable power. If the caster opts, he may
create any of the following:
<P></P>
A) <I>Frigid globe.</I> A small globe of matter at absolute zero temperature that spreads upon
contact with water, or a liquid that is principally water, freezing it to a depth of
6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet per level of the spellcaster.
This ice lasts for one round per level of the caster.
<P></P>
The material component is a thin sheet of crystal about an inch square.
<P></P>
B) <I>Cold ray.</I> The spell can be used as a thin ray of cold that springs from the caster's
hand to a distance of 10 yards per level of the wizard; this ray inflicts 1d4+2
points of damage per level of the caster upon the first creature struck. A
saving throw vs. spell is applicable; all damage is negated if it is successful (as
the ray is so narrow a save indicates it missed). If the first creature is
missed, the path of the ray is plotted to its full distance, and anything else in
its path must save (if applicable) or suffer appropriate damage.
<P></P>
The material component is a white sapphire of not less than 1,000 gp value.
<P></P>
C) <I>Globe of cold.</I> This creates a small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the
touch, but not harmful. This globe can be hurled, either by hand to a distance of 40
yards (considered short range), or as a sling bullet. The globe shatters upon
impact, inflicting 6d6 points of cold damage upon all creatures within a
10-foot radius (one-half damage if a saving throw vs. spell is successful).

Note that if the globe is not thrown or slung
within one round per level of the spellcaster, it shatters and causes cold damage
as stated above. This timed effect can be employed against pursuers, although
it can prove hazardous to the spellcaster and his associates as well.
<P></P>
The material component is a 1,000-gp diamond.
