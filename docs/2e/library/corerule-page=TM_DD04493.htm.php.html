<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Medallion of Spell Exchange: </B>This medallion allows the spellcaster to exchange one memorized spell of up to
6th level for others of lower levels, rather in the manner of <I>Mordenkainen's lucubration</I>. The wizard loses the sacrificed spell and recalls one or more spells from
those he had memorized and cast within the past 24 hours. The total levels of
these spells must be one less in sum than the spell sacrificed. For example, by
sacrificing a 5th-level spell, a wizard could recall one 1st-and one 3rd-level
spell, two 2nd-level spells, four 1st-level spells, and so on. The medallion can
function only once per day. The wizard must have available any spell components
required for exchanged spells.
