When this spell is cast, the priest causes a volume of wood to bend and warp,
permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. The range of a <I>warp wood</I> spell is 10 yards for each level of experience of the caster. It affects
approximately a 15-inch shaft of wood of up to 1-inch diameter per level of the
caster. Thus, at 1st level, a caster might be able to warp a hand axe handle or
four crossbow bolts; at 5th level, he could warp the shaft of a typical spear.
Note that boards or planks can also be affected, causing a door to be sprung or a
boat or ship to leak. Warped missile weapons are useless; warped melee weapons
suffer a -4 penalty to their attack rolls.
<P></P>
Enchanted wood is affected only if the spellcaster is of higher level than the
caster of the prior enchantment. The spellcaster has a 20% cumulative chance
of success per level of difference (20% if one level higher, 40% if two levels
higher, etc.). Thus, a door magically held or wizard locked by a 5th-level
wizard is 40% likely to be affected by a <I>warp wood</I> spell cast by a 7th-level priest. Wooden magical items are considered
enchanted at 12th level (or better). Extremely powerful items, such as artifacts, are
unaffected by this spell.
<P></P>
The reversed spell, <I>straighten wood,</I> straightens bent or crooked wood, or reverses the effects of a <I>warp wood</I> spell, subject to the same restrictions.
