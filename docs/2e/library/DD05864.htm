The law comes down fairly heavily on thieves, and penalties for thievery are
moderately harsh. However, officers of the law may feel they have better things
to do than deal with thieves (e.g., in a rough-and-tumble port city), and with
petty thievery in particular, a thief may get away with handing over the
spoils, paying a spot fine, and getting a gauntleted hand across the back of the
head. In an odd way, the thieves may even have a sneaking regard for the law: the
law is firm, but fair and not arbitrary or excessively harsh, and the thieves
feel they are up against an enemy worthy of their skills.
