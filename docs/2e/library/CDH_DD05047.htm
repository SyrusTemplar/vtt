The Avenger druid has seen Nature suffer great wrongs. Take the case of the
druid Torrens. (See illustration.) He had hoped to live as a Guardian or Village
Druid (listed later in this chapter). However, during his training, forces
defiled the area under his protection and slew his mentor. Maybe he feels he was
too gentle, too weak. It doesn't matter. He won't let it happen again.
<P></P>
Torrens the Avenger no longer holds the defensive. Instead, he roams the world
seeking wrongs to right and foes to fight. And whether his opponent is a
brutal king cutting down an ancient forest to build a fleet of war galleys, or an
evil vampire menacing a peaceful halfling village, the Avenger acts to stop him.
Permanently.
<P></P>
<B>Role: </B>This druid is a grim, strong, and silent warrior of the wilds. Torrens has
little time for anything but his mission, although he's as patient as a spider
when it serves his plans. A loner, he avoids love or friendship, fearing either
could compromise his mission; if he associates with a party of adventurers, he
treats them as allies, but not as friends.
<P></P>
The Avenger rarely speaks more than absolutely necessary to humans and most
demihumans (although he may talk to animals or sylvan races like wood elves). He
doesn't bother to explain or justify his actions. The Avenger dislikes
remaining in one place, and frequently moves on after finishing a particular job.

<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> The druid should spend his initial allotment of gold pieces entirely on
equipment, for he loses any unspent starting money in excess of 1 gp.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> The Avenger receives an additional <I>free</I> weapon proficiency slot to use for any proficiency his branch allows.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> The druid's grim and silent demeanor gives the character a -1 penalty to
reaction adjustment from people in encounters. Torrens, like all Avengers, cannot
have henchmen, hirelings, mercenaries, or servants until he reaches 13th level.
He can have any amount of treasure, but cannot own more treasure and equipment
than he can carry on his back--any excess must go to a worthy cause.
