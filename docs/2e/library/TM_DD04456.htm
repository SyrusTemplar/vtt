<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Wand of Prime Material Pocket:</B> This wand allows a spherical pocket to be created in any plane. The
conditions within the pocket are similar to the environment of the wielder's Prime
Material plane. The pocket typically contains ground, air, and a controlled
temperature. The lower third of the sphere is usually occupied by land and water, while
the upper portion of the sphere is usually occupied by atmosphere.
<P></P>
The surface of the pocket is semipermeable, allowing creatures to exit and
enter the sphere, but keeps the elemental conditions of the pocket completely
separate from the elemental plane.
<P></P>
One charge creates a sphere 10' in diameter. If the wielder wishes, multiple
charges can be used to create larger spheres. Thus, a 30'-diameter sphere could
be created using three charges.
<P></P>
The conditions inside the pocket are of the wielder's choosing, although they
must be similar to an area that naturally exists on the Prime Material plane.
The pocket cannot contain buildings or man-made items.
<P></P>
The pocket lasts 1d6+6 hours on any plane other than the plane of Fire, on
which the pocket will last 1d6 hours. The wielder may choose to use the wand
before the pocket dissipates to extend the life of the existing pocket. The pocket
can be destroyed through the use of a <I>dispel magic</I> spell. The wand is not rechargeable.
