A successful magic resistance check can have four different results, depending
on the nature of the spell being resisted.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Individually Targeted Spells:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">By definition, these spells affect just one creature, and only the targeted
creature rolls for magic resistance, if it has any. If a spell of this type is
directed at several targets, each target rolls independently of the others. An
example of this would be a<I> hold person</I> spell aimed at four creatures, with each creature getting a magic resistance
roll, if they have magic resistance.
<P></P>
If the magic resistance roll is successful, the spell has no effect on that
creature, the spell fails and disappears. If several targets are involved, the
spell could still affect others who fail their magic resistance roll.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Area-Effect Spells:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">These spells are not targeted on a single creature, but on a point. The
spell's effect encompasses everything within a set distance of that point. A
successful magic resistance check enables the creature to ignore the effect of the
spell. However, the spell is not negated and still applies to all others in the
area of effect.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>In-Place Spells:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">These spells operate continuously in a particular place or on a particular
creature, character, or item. <I>Protection from evil</I> is one example of this kind of spell.
<P></P>
Magic resistance comes into play only if a creature or item finds himself or
itself in the place where the spell is in operation. Even then, magic resistance
may not come into play. Nothing happens if the spell isn't of a type that
affects the character. Thus, a<I> part water</I> spell would not collapse simply because a magic resistant creature walked
through the area. A <I>protection from evil</I> spell, which could affect the creature, would be susceptible to magic
resistance.
<P></P>
If the DM determines that a magic resistance roll is appropriate, and the roll
succeeds, the in-place spell collapses, usually with a dramatic thunderclap
and puff of smoke.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Permanent Spells:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Magic resistance is insufficient to destroy a permanent spell. Instead, the
spell is negated, within the same guidelines given for in-place spells, for as
long as the magic resistant creature is in the area of effect.
<P></P>
Thus, a magic-resistant creature might be able to step through a permanent<I> wall of force</I> enchantment as if it weren't there. However, the wall would spring back into
existence as soon as the creature passed through (i.e., no one else can pass
through).
