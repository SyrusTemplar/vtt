<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Dust of Tracelessness:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This normal-seeming dust is actually a highly magical powder that can be used
to conceal the passage of its possessor and his companions. Tossing a pinch of
this dust into the air causes a chamber of up to 1,000 square feet to become as
dusty, dirty, and cobweb-laden as if it had been abandoned and disused for a
decade.
<P></P>
A pinch of dust sprinkled along a trail causes evidence of the passage of as
many as a dozen men and horses to be obliterated for a mile back into the
distance. No magical radiation occurs from the use of this dust.
<P></P>
The substance is typically found in a finely sewn pouch containing 1d12 + 12
pinches.
