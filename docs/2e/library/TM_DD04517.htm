<TITLE>Tenser's Portmanteau of Frugality-- Miscellaneous Magic (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Tenser's Portmanteau of Frugality:</B> This moderately large, black leather traveling case contains a bewildering
number of small instruments--tweezers, measuring beakers, small ceramic jars, and
the like. It can be used to extract the greatest possible benefit from certain
single-use magical items by partly diluting or admixing them. All potions,
oils, dusts, incenses, glues, solvents, and <I>Nolzur's marvelous pigments</I> can be affected by <I>Tenser's portmanteau</I>.
<P></P>
For every two potions, applications of dust, or similar substances that are
treated by the portmanteau, a third active dose or use can be extracted. Any such
item may be affected only once by the power of the portmanteau. Single doses
(a single potion, etc.) do not provide sufficient magic for treatment by the
portmanteau.
<P></P>
The process of extracting the magic is not a simple task. The work takes 2d6
hours to complete. At the end of this time, the wizard must make an Intelligence
check. If successful, the third dose is created. If failed, the third dose
fails and only enough remains of the original materials for a single dose of the
magical substance.
<P></P>
If <I>Alamir's fundamental breakdown</I> is cast during the process, the wizard gains a +2 to his Intelligence check.
In this situation, the spell does not consume the magical items on which it is
cast.
<P></P>
Each use of the portmanteau consumes some of the special agents required for
the process. When discovered, the case holds enough materials to attempt 4d10
duplications.
