Priests? Altar </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Wizards aren?t the only characters capable of creating magical items. Priests,
too, have this capability. Priests can create scrolls at 7th level, potions at
9th level, and other types of magic items at 11th level. Instead of cluttered
laboratories filled with all varieties of reagents and bizarre devices, priests
need only build a special consecrated altar to their deity in order to create
magical items.
