While this spell is in effect, all undead within a 15-yard radius of the
affected object or creature gain a resistance to being turned (or commanded) by the
clerics and paladins of an opposing religion (compared to that of the caster).
The base resistance of the undead to being turned is 20%, plus 5% for every two
levels of experience of the caster (60% at 4th, 65% at 6th, 70% at 8th, up to
a maximum of 95% at 18th level).
<P></P>
This resistance roll is made secretly by the DM before each turning attempt is
made. A single priest can continue attempting to turn or command the resistant
undead creatures each round until either the resistance is overcome or the
turn roll indicates failure. The spell can be centered on a stationary object or
upon any moving creature, including the caster.
