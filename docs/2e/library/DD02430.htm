When a character guards, she waits for her opponents to come to her. Guarding
is a half-move action, or a no-move action if the character stands her ground.
A guarding character strikes the moment an attacker moves into the guarding
character's threatening squares, regardless of her actual initiative and action
phase. The only way an enemy can attack a guarding character first is with a
longer-ranged weapon.
<P></P>
If a guarding character is attacked by a charging character, the character
that won initiative attacks first (unless one of the characters has a
longer-ranged weapon than the other). If both the charging and guarding characters have
weapons of equal range, then the character with the larger weapon strikes first.
Guarding characters are considered to be <I>set for charge</I>, and spears and spear-like polearms inflict double damage against charging
creatures (see <A HREF="DD02742.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02742.htm">Chapter Seven</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">).

<I>For example, Aerwen loses initiative and is armed with a long sword, normally
a weapon of average speed. A very fast size M creature takes a half-move to
attack her with claws in the fast phase, but since Aerwen is guarding, she attacks
first. If the very fast creature were charging, it would attack first since it
won initiative for the round. If Aerwen had a long spear (range 2), she would
get the first blow despite the creature's charge.

If no one attacks a guarding character, she can abort to an attack at the end
of the round and take a half-move to reach someone.
