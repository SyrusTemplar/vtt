<FONT SIZE="3">Dolphins are intelligent seagoing mammals.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">While all dolphins share a variety of common traits,
the species comes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Their long,
compact bodies are superbly adapted to the aquatic environment, and
dolphins are among the most powerful swimmers in the oceans. All
breeds of dolphins have a large fin on their backs, two flippers, a
powerful tail, jaws filled with many sharp teeth, a blow hole, and
are 5 to 6 feet long. Most common and well-known are the gray, or
bottle-nosed dolphins, so named for their gray skin and bottle-shaped
snouts. Other varieties have two-toned blue and gray coloring. The
species communicates through an intricate speech consisting of
high-pitched sounds, some out of the range of human hearing.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="NAVY"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Inherently
peaceful, dolphins will generally attack only if threatened. Unless
outnumbered 2 to 1, dolphins always attack sharks. Whether attacking
a foe or defending their school, dolphins fight as an organized unit,
responding to commands from their leader. They fight with special
vehemence to protect their young, and a select number of dolphins may
sometimes engage in a holding action, sacrificing themselves so that
the remainder of the school can swim to safety.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="NAVY"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Dolphins
are completely carnivorous, living on a diet of fish. Though they
can remain submerged for several minutes at a time, they must surface
regularly to breathe. Unlike most mammals, breathing is a conscious,
rather than unconscious action on the part of dolphins; in other
words, they literally must remember to breathe. Newborn dolphins are
assisted to the surface to breathe by their mothers and a female
dolphin midwife. Dolphins are by nature playful, good-tempered, and
lawful good, despising evil creatures. Most roam the oceans in
schools, numbering as large as 20 dolphins, swimming where their
fancy suits them. They never fight among themselves or with other
breeds of dolphins. Dolphins are famous for the great pleasure they
take in life; when swimming they often perform dazzling aquatic
stunts, leaping in and out of the water in a spectacular fashion.
They will also play with objects that they find and enjoy games.
Dolphins sometimes follow ships, entertaining the crews and
passengers with their antics.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">About 10% of all dolphins live in organized
communities. These groups have 1d4+1 swordfish (AC 6, move 24, 1+1
Hit Dice, 2d6 points of damage/attack) or 1-3 narwhales (AC 6, move
21, 4+4 Hit Dice, 2d12 points of damage/attack) as guards, depending
on the climatic region. If a community is found, there is a 75%
possibility that there are 1d4 additional communities of dolphins
within a five-mile radius. These organized communities of dolphins do
not tolerate the presence of evil sea creatures in their domain, and
if necessary enlist the aid of nomadic schools of dolphins to drive
out evil creatures. Any region inhabited by dolphin communities is
also shark and killer whale free.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Dolphins are highly intelligent and take a benign,
distant interest in human doings. They will always help humans in
distress, guiding them to the shore and keeping the sharks at bay.
Certain solitary dolphins, known as rogues, have been known to form
closer attachments to humans, accompanying them in a friendly fashion
on swimming and fishing expeditions. These rogues often play dolphin
games with their human companions. Dolphins are far more valuable to
men in other respects. Friendly dolphins have warned sailors of the
approach of pirate ships and the intentions of evil sea creatures.
More than one ship owes its safe arrival in port to the timely
intercession and warning of dolphins. They have come to men's aid
when their ships were attacked by mermen and sahuagin. Dolphins have
been known to raid sahuagin communities and destroy their eggs, for
dolphins perceive these monsters as a threat to their safety.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="NAVY"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The
dolphin is both a hunter and hunted in its marine world. Sharks and
other large evil sea creatures hunt the dolphin with enthusiasm.
Despite its many enemies, the dolphin has many distinct advantages
that enable it to survive and even flourish. Not only is it a strong,
swift swimmer, but its intelligence and organized lifestyle are
highly effective defenses against its enemies.</FONT></P>
