Squaring the circle</I> allows a wizard to alter the shape of the area of effect of one spell of 1st-
through 5th-level spells. The spell to be affected must be cast within the
duration of the <I>squaring the circle spell</I>.
<P></P>
Square or cubic areas of effect can be transformed into circular or spherical
areas of effect. Circular or spherical areas of effect can likewise be
transformed into square or cubic areas of effect. In both cases, the length of a side
of a square area is equated to the diameter of a circular or spherical area.
<P></P>
Alternatively, a square or cubic area can be transformed into a rectangle. The
rectangle cannot cover more or less square footage than the standard square
area of the spell.
<P></P>
Similarly, a circular or spherical area can be transformed into an oval or egg
shape. The area covered by the oval or egg shape cannot cover more or less
square footage than the original area of the spell.
<P></P>
The material component is a small pendant of any precious metal with a circle
fashioned inside a square.
