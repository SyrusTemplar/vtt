<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Armor of Missile Attraction:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This armor appears to be a normal suit of magical armor (determine type and
modifier normally). However, the armor is cursed and actually serves to attract
missiles. The wearer is two or three times more likely to be selected as a
random target of missiles than normal. In cases where each person is the target of a
set number of missiles (most often in large combats), the wearer will have a
greater number of missiles fired at him. Furthermore, the magical protection of
the armor will fail when calculated for missile attacks. The true nature of the
armor will not reveal itself until the character is fired upon in
earnestâ€”simple experiments (throwing rocks, etc.) will not suffice.
