</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Any Large creature armed with a weapon adds 1 to its range, due to its great
natural reach. For example, an ogre wielding a spear (normally range 1) has a
range of 2 with the weapon. Any Huge creature armed with a weapon adds 2 to the
weapon's range. A Gargantuan creature adds 3 to a weapon's range; a titan
swinging a 15-foot sword endangers an enemy quite a ways off.
<P></P>
Some monsters may also have natural attacks that allow them to strike
opponents at ranges greater than 1.
