This simple weapon is a ring with a flip-up lid, below which is a needle
capable of delivering a dose of poison (or knock-out drug, etc.) to the target. The
most primitive version of this will have the pin simply sitting in a small
reservoir of liquid drug or toxin. Since administration of the poison/drug is
rather haphazard here, the victim receives a bonus of +2 to any saving throw against
its effects. Subtler and more refined designs have a needle capable of drawing
up liquid from a reservoir, so that only a normal saving throw (or even one
with a -2 penalty) applies. The DM should decide which to allow in the campaign
(both can exist at the same time, of course).

An attack with a pin ring is a called shot (with a -4 penalty to the attack
roll) because it must strike exposed flesh-the pin will not administer poison
through any significant thickness of clothing. A strike to the neck is the
time-honored way of making sure the toxin gets into the bloodstream quickly. The DM
may rule in unusual cases that no called shot is needed (e.g., the thief
surprises a victim in his bath) or that the pin ring cannot be effective at all (e.g.,
the victim is clad from head to toe in field plate).
