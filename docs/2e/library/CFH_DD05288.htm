Usually, it's too much trouble to calculate proportions on every attack you
sustain. Instead, keep a separate track of all damage you receive in a single
combat from Punching, Martial Arts, and Sap attacks. When the combat is over,
divide them up into Normal and Temporary damage. When you have a fraction of .5 (or
less) on the Normal Damage result, round down; all the rest of the damage is
Temporary damage.

<I>Example: Sir Amstard is in a boxing match with the devastating Cassius, and is
getting the worst of it. He takes one shot for 5 points of damage, another for
6, and another for 3, and on this third shot Cassius successfully rolls his
Knockout percentage. Amstard is knocked out.
<P></P>
Amstard has sustained a total of 14 points of damage. One-fourth, or 25%, of
that is Normal Damage. That's 3.5, which we round down to 3. He's taken 3 points
of Normal Damage. The remaining 11 points are Temporary damage.
