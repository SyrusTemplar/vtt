<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Boat, Folding:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A folding boat will always be discovered as a small wooden &quot;box''?about one
foot long, one-half foot wide, and one-half foot deep. It will, of course,
radiate magic if subjected to magical detection. The &quot;box'' can be used to store
items like any other box. If a command word is given, however, the box will unfold
itself to form a boat of 10 feet length, four feet width and two feet depth. A
second (different) command word will cause it to unfold to a 24-foot long,
8-foot-wide, and 6-foot deep ship.
<P></P>
In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and
lateen sail. In its larger form, the boat is decked, has single rowing seats, five
sets of oars, a steering oar, anchor, a deck cabin, a mast, and square sail.
The first can hold three or four people comfortably, the second will carry
fifteen with ease.
<P></P>
A third word of command causes the boat to fold itself into a box once again.
The words of command may be inscribed visibly or invisibly on the box, or they
may be written elsewhere?perhaps on an item within the box. The words might
have been lost, making the boat useless (except as a small box) until the finder
discovers the words himself (via <I>legend lore,</I> consulting a sage, physical search of a dungeon, etc.).
