When this spell is cast, waves of force roll forth from the caster, moving in
the direction he faces and causing all wooden objects in the path of the spell
to be pushed away from the caster to the limit of the area of effect. Wooden
objects above 3 inches in diameter that are fixed firmly are not affected, but
loose objects (movable mantles, siege towers, etc.) move back. Objects less than
3 inches in diameter that are fixed splinter and break, and the pieces move
with the wave of force. Thus, objects such as wooden shields, spears, wooden
weapon shafts and hafts, and arrows and bolts are pushed back, dragging those
carrying them with them. If a spear is planted to prevent this forced movement, it
splinters. Even magical items with wooden sections are turned, although an
anti-magic shell blocks the effects. A successful<I> dispel magic</I> spell ends the effect. Otherwise, the<I> turn wood</I> spell lasts for one round for each experience level of the caster.
<P></P>
The waves of force continue to sweep down the set path for the spell's
duration, pushing back wooden objects in the area of effect at a rate of 40 feet per
melee round. The length of the path is 20 feet per level of the caster. Thus if
a 14th-level priest casts a<I> turn wood</I> spell, the area of effect is 120 feet wide by 280 feet long, and the spell
lasts 14 rounds. After casting the spell, the path is set and the caster can then
do other things or go elsewhere without affecting the spell's power.
