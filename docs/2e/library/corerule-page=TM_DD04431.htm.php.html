Aromatic oils are a special type of magical oil. Like perfumes, their power
comes from the scent released. All aromatic oils are inert until worn by a living
creature. Once applied, the aromatic oil gradually begins to react, and after
1d4 rounds have passed, the scent's stated effect begins. In all cases, the
creature wearing the aromatic oil is not affected, but other creatures (both
friends and foes) within a 5-foot radius of the wearer are subject to its effects.
Note that only those creatures with a sense of smell can be affected by a
magical fragrance.

These precious perfumes are commonly found in tiny stoppered vials made of
glass, clay, metal, or wood. Only a small amount is required per use. Each vial
contains enough aromatic oil for 1d10+10 applications.
