<P></P>
When a weapon possesses unusual characteristics, it has a <I>personality,</I> which is rated by combining its intelligence and ego scores. The weapon will,
of course, be absolutely true to its alignment, and if the character who
possesses the weapon is not, personality conflict—weapon versus character—will
result.
<P></P>
Similarly, any weapon with an ego of 19 or higher will always consider itself
superior to any character, and a personality conflict will result if the
possessor does not always agree with the weapon.
<P></P>
The <I>personality score</I> of a character is:
<P></P>
<P></P>
Intelligence + Charisma + Experience Level
<P></P>
<P></P>
Note that the personality score is reduced by one for every group of hit
points of damage taken equal to the character's average number of points per level.
Divide the character's total hit points by his level (round up). For example: A
fighter of 7th level has 53 hit points: 53 divided by 7 equals 7.6. Thus for
every eight points of damage he suffers, his personality score will be lowered
by one.
<P></P>
Whenever personality conflict occurs, the weapon will resist the character's
desires and demand concessions such as:
<P></P>
<P></P>
1. Removal of associates, henchmen, hirelings, or creatures of alignment or
<P></P>
personality distasteful to the weapon.
<P></P>
2. The character divesting himself of all other magical weapons.
<P></P>
3. Obedience from the character so weapon can lead the expedition for its own
<P></P>
purposes
<P></P>
4. Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to the weapon
<P></P>
5. Encrustation of pommel, hilt, scabbard, baldric, or belt with gems and a
special
<P></P>
container made of precious substances for its safekeeping.
<P></P>
6. Magical protections and devices to protect it from molestation when not in use
<P></P>
7. That the character pay it handsomely for all abilities and powers the weapon
is
<P></P>
called upon to exercise in behalf of its possessor
<P></P>
8. That the character carry it with him on all occasions
<P></P>
9. That the character relinquish the weapon in favor of a more suitable person
due
<P></P>
to alignment differences or conduct
<P></P>
<P></P>
Any time the personality score of a weapon exceeds the personality score of
the character who possesses it, the weapon will dominate its possessor, and it
can force any or all of the above demands or actually cause any of the following
actions:
<P></P>
<P></P>
1. Force its possessor into combat
<P></P>
2. Refuse to strike opponents
<P></P>
3. Strike at its wielder or his associates
<P></P>
4. Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent
<P></P>
5. Cause itself to drop from the character's grasp
<P></P>
<P></P>
Naturally, such actions are unlikely where the character-weapon alignment and
purposes are harmonious. However, the weapon might well wish to have a lesser
character possess it so as to easily command him, or a higher level possessor so
as to better accomplish its goals.
<P></P>
All magical weapons with personalities will desire to play an important role
in the success of activities, particularly combat. Such weapons are rivals of
each other, even if of the same alignment. They will be aware of the presence of
any similar weapon within 60 feet, and try their best to lead a possessor into
missing or destroying the rival unless this is totally inimical to its nature—a <I>holy avenger,</I> for example, would certainly not allow destruction of any other lawful good
weapon and might encourage their discovery, even at the risk of having to face
grim odds to do so.
<P></P>
Weapons of this nature will never be totally controlled or silenced by the
characters who possess them, even though they may be heavily outweighed by
personality force. They may be powerless to force their demands, but they will be in
there plugging. Even a humble +1 weapon of unusual nature can be a vocal martyr,
denigrating its own abilities and asking only that the character give it the
chance to shatter itself against some hated enemy, etc.
<P></P>
Note: Most players will be unwilling to play weapons with personalities as the
personalities dictate. It is incumbent upon the DM to ensure that the role of
the weapon is played to the hilt, so to speak, with the DM assuming the persons
of the weapon if necessary.
