This spell causes an arm made of compacted soil to rise from the ground. The
spell must be cast on open turf, such as a grassy field or a dirt floor.
<P></P>
The earthen arm and hand (which are about the same size as a normal human
limb) arise from the ground beneath one creature targeted by the caster. The hand
attempts to grasp the creature's leg. The victim must attempt a saving throw; if
successful, the hand sinks into the ground. Each round thereafter (until the
spell ends or the target moves out of spell range), the hand has a 5% chance per
level of the caster of reappearing beneath the targeted creature, at which
time another saving throw is required.
<P></P>
If a saving throw is missed, the earthen limb firmly grasps and holds the
creature in place. An individual held by the hand suffers a movement rate of 0,
Armor Class penalty of -2, and attack penalty of -2. All Dexterity combat bonuses
are negated. The hand causes no physical damage to the victim.
<P></P>
The arm may be attacked by any creature, including the arm's victim. The arm
has AC 5 and hit points equal to double the caster's maximum hit points. For
example, a caster who normally has 15 hit points can create an earthen hand with
30 hit points. The maximum number of hit points that an earthen hand may have is
40. When the arm's hit points are reduced to zero or when the spell duration
ends, the hand crumbles.
<P></P>
The material component is a miniature hand sculpted from clay, which crumbles
to dust when the spell is cast.
