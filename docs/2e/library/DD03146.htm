<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Weapon Groups</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Many weapons are categorized into groups, either tight groups, or broad
groups. Often a weapon will be part of a tight group, and that tight group will in
turn be part of a broad group. A character?s proficiency with a weapon or group
will often convey weapon familiarity with other related weapons.

is significant overlap in many categories?a broadsword is listed in the
ancient, Roman, and medium tight groups because it can be used in a variety of
cultures and styles.

If a character knows several different fighting styles (explained later in <A HREF="DD03155.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03155.htm">this chapter</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) he can use a weapon in any of the styles he knows. If he has only learned
one style, however, his proficiency only applies when he uses that weapon with
the appropriate style.
