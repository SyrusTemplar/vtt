<FONT SIZE="4"><FONT COLOR="PURPLE">Movement </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Obviously,
movement is an important part of a fight. If a character is wielding
a sword, he can&#146;t hurt anyone with it unless he gets very close
to them. The more time a character spends moving, the less he is able
to do when he gets there.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">In the standard AD&amp;D game, every character and
monster has a base movement rate. Since <I>Player&#146;s Option</I>
combat rounds are shorter than AD&amp;D rounds, each point of that
base movement rate allows a PC, NPC, or creature to move one square
per combat round in melee scale. A human fighter with a movement rate
of 12 can move 12 squares, or 60 feet, in one combat round. If a
character moves diagonally, it costs 3 movement points for each 2
squares, rounded up. If a character moves three squares diagonally,
it costs 5 movement points: 3 for the first two squares and 2 for the
the third square.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Remember, this is a conservative advance. Figures can
exceed their normal movement rates by <I>charging, running, </I>or <I>sprinting
</I>(</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="DD02479.htm">see
Attack Options, below</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). The same
human fighter sprints 180 feet in a combat round, which isn&#146;t
bad for an untrained runner wearing sturdy boots, heavy clothes, and
carrying a sword.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3">Characters determine their combat system movement in
three steps:</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Determine the
character&#146;s base movement rate from his character race;</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Adjust the base
movement rate for exceptional ability scores;</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Modify the
character&#146;s movement due to his encumbrance.</FONT></P>
