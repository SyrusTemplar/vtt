The druids of history lived among the Germanic tribes of Western Europe and
Britain during the days of the Roman Empire. They acted as advisors to tribal
chieftains. They believed the earth was the mother of all things, and they revered
it, the sun, the moon, and certain trees as deities.
<P></P>
Druids in the AD&amp;D game are nature priests, protecting pristine woodlands from
the depredations of monsters and civilization. They are only loosely based on
their historical namesakes.
<P></P>
A druid is allowed to wear only leather armor and use only wooden
shields—natural materials. A druid may use only the following weapons: club, sickle, dart,
spear, dagger, scimitar, sling, and staff.
<P></P>
A druid’s standard selection of spells includes major access to the spheres of
all, animal, elemental, healing, plant, and weather, and minor access to
divination. A druid can use magical items allowed to priests, except for books and
scrolls.
<P></P>
<P></P>
A druid has 100 character points to purchase skills. Skills costs 5 to 15
points. Any unspent points can be used to acquire nonweapon proficiencies or saved
for use during the game.

small bird to that of a black bear. The druid can assume the forms of normal
creatures only. When assuming a new form, a druid is healed of 10–60% of any damage
he has suffered (round down). The druid also assumes the creature’s physical
characteristics (armor class, movement mode and rate, etc.). The druid’s
clothing and one item held in each hand also become part of his new shape—these
reappear when the druid resumes his bipedal form.
