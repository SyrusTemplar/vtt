<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Shield Proficiency</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A weapon proficiency slot can be spent to gain a shield proficiency.
Warriors can gain this proficiency by spending 1 slot; other characters must spend 2
weapon proficiency slots to become proficient in shield use. Obviously, a
character must be able to use a shield to acquire this proficiency.
<P></P>
Shield proficiency improves a character?s AC against one or more attacks per
round from in front or from the side faced by the shield. This proficiency does
not help against rear attacks or attacks coming from the flank opposite the
shield.
<P></P>
Like other weapon proficiencies, the shield proficiency must be taken for a
specific type of equipment?listed on <A HREF="DD03152.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03152.htm">Table 51</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">: Shield Proficiency Effects. The bonuses conferred vary by the type of shield
the character chooses, and are added to the normal AC benefits of carrying a
shield. The Number of Attackers category indicates how many attacks, per round,
the shield proficiency can help against. If a character with a buckler, for
example, is attacked by three enemies at once, his shield proficiency will only
benefit his AC against one of those attacks. The player should designate which
enemy he will guard against before attack rolls are made.
