Many AD&amp;D game players are familiar with the character kits in the <I>Player?s Handbook</I> Rules Supplement series. <I>Player?s Option</I> kits are different. They are packages of descriptions, proficiencies,
benefits, and hindrances that help flesh out characters. In short, the kits give
adventurers background and depth.

<I>Player?s Option</I> kits are available to more characters than previouly published kits are. No
longer are fighters and thieves the only ones who can become swashbucklers. And
rogues aren?t the only characters who can excel as acrobats. With some
exceptions, a character of any class can choose any kit. Many <I>Player?s Option</I> kits are linked to the social ranks system presented below.

Selecting a character kit is free?it has no character point cost. However, it
carries a character point benefit. A character with a kit can purchase any of
the recommended weapon and nonweapon proficiencies listed for 1 character point
less than the cost detailed in the <A HREF="DD03011.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03011.htm">proficiency section</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
