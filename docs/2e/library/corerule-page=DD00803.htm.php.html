<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ring of Spell Storing:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A <I>ring of spell storing</I> contains 1d4+1 spells which the wearer can employ as if he were a
spellcaster of the level required to use the stored spells. The class of spells contained
within the ring is determined in the same fashion as the spells on scrolls
(see &quot;<A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD00755.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD00755.htm.php.html">Scrolls</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> ''). The level of each spell is determined by rolling 1d6 (for priests) or
1d8 (for wizards). The number rolled is the level of the spell, as follows:
<P></P>
Priest: 1d6, if 6 is rolled, roll 1d4 instead.
<P></P>
Wizard: 1d8, if 8 is rolled, roll 1d6 instead.
<P></P>
Which spell type of any given level is contained by the ring is also randomly
determined.
<P></P>
The ring empathically imparts to the wearer the names of its spells. Once
spell class, level, and type are determined, the properties of the ring are fixed
and unchangeable. Once a spell is cast from the ring, it can be restored only by
a character of appropriate class and level of experience (i.e., a 12th-level
wizard is needed to restore a 6th-level magical spell to the ring). Stored
spells have a casting time of five.
