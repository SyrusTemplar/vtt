Some aspect of the player character's personality might suggest whether he's
best suited for the life of a mage or that of a specialist. An impulsive,
overeager character might lack the patience for the studious life of a specialist.
Conversely, a thoughtful, scholarly character might find the life of a mage too
confining. A character who comes from a long line of mages might want to
continue the family tradition. A character whose brother was killed by an evil
specialist NPC might want to study the same school to prepare himself for a
confrontation with the murderer
