<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Banish: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The spell takes something that is out of place and returns it to its proper
location. It is important to remember that a character can create many different
types of banishments. Sending an extra-planar creature back to its home plane
is a classic example. However, banishment-type magic can also drive away a
psyche that has used a <I>magic jar</I> spell to invade another mind, return a restless spirit to its grave, or even
restore a stolen object to its rightful owner. All other types of magic
described in this section are similarly versatile.
<P></P>
The main difference between a banishment and a dispel is that a banishment
works even if there is no magic operating on a target. For example, a tanar’ri who
has come to the Prime Material Plane of its own free will can be returned to
the Abyss. A banishment only returns something to its proper place; it cannot
undo a transformation or affliction.
<P></P>
A banishment’s duration cannot be extended. At base difficulty (30), a
banishment spell performs one action on one creature or object.
<P></P>
The distance a banished target must travel to return to its proper place is
not a factor in a banishment, but the distance between the caster and where the
target is when the spell is cast is a factor (see <A HREF="DD01335.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01335.htm">Table 31</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">).

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Dispel: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The spell ends or undoes other magic. Unlike banishment, a dispel is
ineffective unless there is magic currently operating on the target. A dispel can send a
summoned tanar’ri back to the Abyss as long as the magic that brought it here
is still operating, but it can’t send the tanar’ri away if it left the Abyss on
its own or arrived on the Prime Material Plane through the use of
instantaneous magic, such as <I>teleport without error </I>or <I>plane shift</I>.
<P></P>
When pitted against other 10th-level spells, a dispel’s area of effect must be
large enough to cover the entire target; if not, the dispel automatically
fails. A dispel always works against the caster’s own magic; otherwise, the chance
to dispel depends on the difference in level between the caster and the
targeted magical effect.
<P></P>
At base difficulty (30) the chance to destroy an opposing spell is 50%; the
check is made on 1d20, and a roll of 11 or higher indicates success. If the
dispel caster is higher level than the character who created the targeted effect,
the caster adds the difference in levels to the die roll. If the caster is lower
level than the character who created the targeted effect, the caster subtracts
the difference in levels from the roll. The caster rolls once for each
10th-level effect present.
<P></P>
If directed against spells or spell-like effects of 9th level or lower, the
base chance for success is 100% instead of 50%, and the dispel’s area of effect
is irrelevant—dispelling any portion of the effect unravels the whole spell.
<P></P>
A successfully cast dispel destroys a permanent effect or magical item if the
caster is of higher level than the creator of the magical item or spell effect.
If the caster of the dispel is of lower level, the permanent effect or magical
item merely ceases to function for 1d4 rounds. A successful dispel also
destroys a permanent effect or magical item if the dispel caster is of higher level
than the spell caster or item creator. If the dispel fails, or the dispel caster
is of lower level, the permanent effect is rendered nonoperational for 1d4
rounds.
<P></P>
The permanent item or effect must be individually targeted, and the dispel has
no other effect when so used. Note that a magical item resists this spell at
its creator’s level. If the creator’s level is unknown, the DM should assign one
or use the values listed in the <I>dispel magic </I>spell description from the <A HREF="PHB_DD01900.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01900.htm">PHB</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
Augmenting a dispel can have varied effects. The caster receives a+1 bonus to
the die roll for every five points of difficulty added to the spell, making it
easier for a lower level caster to dispel a higher level caster’s magic. If a
dispel’s duration is extended, the spell creates a zone of antimagic that
prevents spellcasting and disrupts any magic brought into the area. See <I>Nazzer’s nullification</I>.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Reflect: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The spell reverses or redirects actions within the area of effect. A spell
that forces a group of workers to demolish a wall they are building is a
reflection. A spell that reflects hostile actions back upon the aggressor is a
reflection coupled with a ward.
<P></P>
One specific action, such as brick laying, by one creature can be reversed at
base difficulty (25). The reversal can affect several creatures if the caster
chooses a larger area of effect. If a limited class of actions, such as movement
or physical attacks, is reversed, the base difficulty is doubled (50). If a
general class of actions is reversed, such as all attacks, the difficulty is
tripled (75).

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ward: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The spell foils a specific type of attack or discourages hostile actions.
<P></P>
At base difficulty (35), a ward provides complete immunity to the normal form
of a specific type of attack (fire, edged weapons, poison, etc.) and grants a
+4 bonus against magical attacks (or a –4 attack penalty if a saving throw is
not applicable). Even if the save fails, damage from the warded attack is reduced
by half.
<P></P>
If the difficulty is increased further, the ward can negate damage from the
warded form of attack by one point of damage for every two points of difficulty.
The protection lasts until exhausted or the spell duration ends. Reduced damage
is computed after applicable saving throws.
<P></P>
A ward can provide protection against attacks that do not inflict damage
(charms, petrifaction, etc.). At base difficulty (35), a ward provides a +4 saving
throw bonus against the specified attack. At a difficulty of 105, a ward grants
a 50% resistance to the attack form in addition to the saving throw bonus. At a
difficulty of 210, the ward provides 100% resistance to the attack. This
resistance can be reduced if the attack is a true dweomer that has an increased
difficulty (see the notes to <A HREF="DD01338.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01338.htm">Table 34</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). If a ward spell is applied to a creature that already enjoys magic
resistance, the creature is entitled to two resistance rolls when attacked, once for
the ward and once for the creature’s magic resistance—the two values are not
added together.
<P></P>
A ward can also be used as a hedge to keep a specific creature (Razortooth the
orc, Infyrana the red dragon, etc.) from entering the area of effect unless it
saves vs. magic. If a type of creature is hedged out (orcs, red dragons), the
base difficulty is doubled (70). If a general class of creature is hedged out
(humanoids, dragons), the difficulty is tripled (105).
<P></P>
A ward can be combined with another type of spell—usually a strike,
reflection, or charm. An active ward can be triggered by a creature entering the area or
by a specific action performed within the area. The more general the condition,
the greater the difficulty, as above. For example, a ward that triggers a
blast of fire if Razortooth the orc enters the room has a difficulty of 35. A
similar ward that is triggered when a certain gem is moved also has a difficulty of
35 (because only one specific action triggers it), even though any creature
could be affected.
