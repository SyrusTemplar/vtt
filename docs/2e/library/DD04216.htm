By means of this spell, the wild mage is able to shape and direct the patterns
of water currents, allowing him to mold liquids into a variety of forms. The
spell affects a quantity of liquid no larger than the area of effect. If cast
onto a larger body, such as an ocean or large lake, the spell affects only the
water within the area of effect.
<P></P>
After casting <I>waveform</I>, the mage can form the water into any desired shape. The spell does not bind
the liquid together in any fashion; it is still limited by its fluid properties
and gravity. Thus, a mage could not use <I>waveform</I> to create a humanoid creature with arms and legs and direct it to walk across
land. He could, however, create a roughly human shape with flowing arms that
rises out of the water, crashes forward in a huge splash, then rises and repeats
the process. Other possible shapes include gigantic waves, geysers,
whirlpools, and troughs.
<P></P>
The shape takes one round to form, after which it can be maintained by
concentration. The shape can be directed to move in any direction at the rate of 90
feet per round. If the <I>waveform</I> moves into or through a body of water, the form loses no intensity. However,
if the wave is moved over dry ground, it loses one die of damage for every 10
feet crossed.
<P></P>
If propelled against a target, the <I>waveform</I> causes 1d4 points of damage per level of the caster to creatures in its path.
The <I>waveform</I> can be directed against creatures on the surface or underwater. Those struck
are allowed a saving throw; success indicates half damage.
<P></P>
If the victims are in or on a body of water, the shape will sweep them along.
Creatures of small size are carried with the form, moving at its speed. Medium
and large size creatures are swept along at half the water's speed. Creatures
larger than this resist the movement. Those caught in the current can make a
Strength check each round to swim free of the current.
<P></P>
Boats and ships are particularly vulnerable to the <I>waveform</I>. If the <I>waveform</I> is twice the size of the vessel or more, the ship must make a seaworthiness
check (as described in Table 77 of the <A HREF="DMG_DD00645.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00645.htm">DMG</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">). Vessels passing the check suffer damage as described above, reducing
seaworthiness ratings for future checks by 2d6 points until repairs are made.
<P></P>
Alternatively, this spell can be cast directly at a single water-based
creature--a water weird, water elemental, or other creature from the elemental plane
of water. In this case, the spell causes 1d6 points of damage per level of the
caster. The effect is instantaneous and the spell ends immediately after the
attack is made.
<P></P>
The material component is a small, carved oar decorated with aquamarines worth
at least 500 gp. The oar disintegrates when the spell is cast.
