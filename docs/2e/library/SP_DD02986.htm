<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Nobles</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Nobles are those born to the highest ranks of society. They are rich, dress
well, and they usually spend money frivolously. They are the privileged few the
common people idolize. And they are the symbols of what others often consider
the best in the world.
<P></P>
This leads many nobles to believe they are better than everyone around
them-not just in wealth or social standing, but in manner and abilities. This sense of
superiority can manifest itself as overwhelming pride, arrogance, and
condescending snobbery. These nobles use their wealth, standing, and power to take what
they want from those weaker than themselves. They can be as brutal, savage,
and unthinking as the horrific monsters they slay.
<P></P>
Not all nobles are like this, however. Some feel a certain sense of
stewardship for the unwashed hordes. These nobles consider it their duty to do all in
their power to better the world-as long as their lifestyles are not jeopardized.
They can be chivalrous toward members of the opposite sex, and they might
occasionally stop to chat with peasants. These nobles mean well, but they may be out
of touch with what is important in the lives of the common people.
<P></P>
Nobles need not be played as brutal tyrants or out-of-touch fops and dandies,
but there are plenty of wealthy individuals who fit those two archetypes.
