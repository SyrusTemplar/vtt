<P></P>
<P></P>
Sphere: Necromantic
<P></P>
Range: Touch
<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>
Duration: Special
<P></P>
Casting Time: 8
<P></P>
Area of Effect: One undead
<P></P>
Saving Throw: None
<P></P>
<P></P>
For the duration of this spell, the recipient undead becomes a magical focus
for the caster, who can now funnel any chosen, currently-carried ?companion?
spell through the undead. Any companion spell is emitted from the undead, but all
casting activity (including component use) is performed by the priest. Distance
does not matter, so long as priest and undead remain on the same plane.
<P></P>
However, unless other spells (such as <I>spectral senses, reflecting pool,</I> or <I>magic font</I>) are employed to ?see? the undead?s current surroundings (or it is in a known
location), companion spells will be hurled blindly. A priest can cast multiple
spells, one per round, through the undead, until it is destroyed or a maximum
of one spell per level of the priest has been cast or the spell expires (it
lasts up to 10 turns per level).
<P></P>
With this spell, a hidden priest can avoid direct combat, employing an undead
as a spell-casting fighting-focus. This spell can be cast on an undead affected
by <I>spectral senses, undead alacrity,</I> or <I>resist turning</I>, and the spells will function simultaneously. Finally, the undead may be
controlled by clerical ability, spell, or magical item, without hampering the <I>imbuement</I>.
