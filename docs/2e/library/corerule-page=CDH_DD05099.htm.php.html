<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Not all sacred groves have magical powers, but many of
them do. A grove may have been innately magical since the creation of
the world or have gained its magic through an unusual event, such as
a visit by a deity, the birth of a unicorn, or a dryad or nymph's
long-time residence in the grove. Lesser Magical Groves</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">An enchanted lesser sacred grove always radiates
magic, although never good or evil. It has the following properties:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Druids entering the
grove feel a watching presence and a sense of power. For every three
rounds they spend within its boundaries they learn one power of the
sacred grove, through a vision or intuition.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> All druids receive a
+1 bonus to saving throws vs. spell, death magic, and wands while
within a lesser magical grove. The grove's steward receives a +2 bonus.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> All in the grove are
rendered immune to magical <I>fear</I> while within it.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> <I>Dig</I> spells
never work within a grove.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Natural (nonmagical)
lightning never strikes trees or beings in the grove.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Evil enchanted
creatures cannot enter the grove unless it has been defiled. (See
&quot;Defiled and Cursed Groves&quot; in this chapter.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">In addition to these abilities, lesser magical sacred
groves may possess other powers. To quickly create a grove the PCs
might stumble upon while adventuring, the DM first decides how many
lesser powers the grove has (chooses or rolls 2d4-2). Then, the DM
selects the powers from Table 3 or rolls 1d10 to pick from the table
randomly. (Descriptions of the powers follow.)</FONT></P>

</TABLE></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Awakened Plants.</B> The grove's magic has
&quot;awakened&quot; 1d3 10-foot-square patches of weeds, creepers,
or bushes with semi-intelligence, 4 Hit Dice, AC 10, and the ability
to attack as an <I>entangle</I> spell. They will act to protect
themselves and defend the grove.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Bountiful.</B> If the sacred grove contains plants
that produce edible fruit, nuts, or berries, 3d6+20 enchanted
examples sprout each spring along with the usual crop. The magic
fruit, nuts, or berries--the largest and most healthy of their
species--confer the benefits of a <I>goodberry</I> spell's products
on the characters who eat them. Once picked, no more will grow until
the following year.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Control Temperature.</B> Any Nature worshiper in
the grove may make a grove's temperature rise or fall within 30
degrees. This ability, possible once per day, affects the entire
grove. Arctic or desert groves commonly feature this power, which
enables those in the grove to survive brief climatic extremes,
especially combined with the power to still winds (below).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Faerie Fire.</B> A Nature worshiper (even a
nonpriest) may cause a <I>faerie fire</I> luminance to appear,
centered on the character or upon any of the trees, rocks, or
standing stones in the grove. The <I>faerie fire</I>, which lasts one
turn per level of the caller, can be summoned once per person in a
given day. <I>Faerie fire</I> that druids call endures for two turns
per level of the druid and can flicker about the grove at will. When
a druid casts a<I> faerie fire</I> spell within the grove, its
duration triples.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Healing.</B> Beings of neutral alignment or those
allied to the druid may heal wounds at twice the rate of natural
healing while in the magical sacred grove. Healing-related spells
produce the maximum benefits; for instance, <I>cure light wounds</I>
restores 8 points of damage.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Prophecy.</B> A druid who spends the night sleeping
in the grove may receive a magical portent in a dream concerning the
past, present, or future. The nature of the prophecy remains the DM's
decision, but it should never contain more information than would
come to light using a properly cast <I>commune with nature</I> spell.
The portent usually warns of danger or hints at a task Nature wishes
the druid to perform.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Protective Aura.</B> Any creature but a druid,
dryad, or nymph who sees the grove must save vs. spell. Those who
fail perceive the grove as nothing other than a normal clearing (or
the like) until they are led into it. The sacred grove also generates
a continual protective field similar to <I>protection from evil, 10' radius,</I>
except it covers the entire grove and has the powers of both <I>protection
from evil</I> and <I>protection from good</I> spells.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Still Winds.</B> Worshipers of Nature in the sacred
grove (even nonpriests) can cause winds to calm for up to one turn
per level, as long as they concentrate on maintaining this power.
Triple the duration when a druid invokes it. This power, possible
once per day, is quite common in desert, mountain, and arctic groves,
as it protects the sacred grove and those in it from sandstorms,
tornadoes, or snowstorms, and the like.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Sweet Water.</B> Water from a source within the
grove or dew gathered from the grass in the area has the properties
of <I>sweet water</I>, but loses these special properties as soon as
it is removed from the site.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Special.</B> The DM can create a power associated
with the branch or kit of the druid that sanctified this grove. For
instance, the grove of a Hivemaster might contain a wasp's nest or
beehive from which a druid could call an <I>insect plague</I> once
per day, while a swamp druid's grove could feature a patch of firm
ground that turns suddenly to quicksandlike mud (as in a <I>rock to mud</I> spell).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Greater Magical Groves</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">A greater magical sacred grove possesses exceptional
enchantments. Each domain includes fewer than a score of such groves,
most of which fall under the control of druids of 12th or higher level.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">A greater grove has all the basic powers of the lesser
grove, mentioned earlier. In addition, druids who sleep overnight in
the grove before praying for spells receive an extra spell. Thus, a
druid who chooses two 1st- and one 2nd-level spell receives another
1st- or 2nd-level spell of the DM's choice.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">A greater magical sacred grove has 2d4 lesser grove
powers (rolled on Table 3) and 1d4 greater grove powers (rolled on
Table 4). Descriptions of the greater powers follow.</FONT></P>

</TABLE></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Awakened Tree.</B> A large, ancient tree living in
the grove gains Intelligence and Wisdom (2d6+6), the spellcasting
ability of a 3rd-level druid, and the power of speech. It can use any
two of its branches at once like arms. It speaks--in a deep, slow
voice--in the secret language of the druids. In combat, treat it as a
treant created by the <I>liveoak</I> spell. Roots bind it to the
earth like a normal tree.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Beast Speech.</B> Any normal or giant animal with
an Intelligence score between animal and low can speak and understand
the secret language of the druids for as long as it remains within
the sacred grove. The animal's Intelligence does not increase. Also,
casting <I>animal summoning</I> calls a 50% greater number (or Hit
Dice) of animals than usual.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Concealment.</B> All mobile beings (not normal
plants) within the grove when this power is invoked become <I>invisible</I>
for three turns per level of the druid or until they leave the grove.
This power, possible once a day, ceases to conceal anyone who attacks.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Earthpower.</B> When druids in the sacred grove
cast a Plant or Earth Elemental sphere spell within its boundaries,
they double the spell's duration, area of effect, and range.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Know Alignment.</B> A druid may know the alignment
of others in the sacred grove by concentrating one round. (The druid
and subject must remain in the grove during this time.) This
spell-like power can be used any number of times. Nonpriest
worshipers of Nature can use this power after two rounds of
concentration (and two successful Wisdom checks), but can make only
one attempt.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Peaceful.</B> Anyone entering this grove may notice
odd sights, like predators and prey playing together. Those who make
a successful attack against another within this grove must make a
saving throw vs. wands. Attackers who fail suffer all the damage
themselves; the wounds they meant to inflict appear on their own
bodies. If they save, they suffer only half damage.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Reincarnation.</B> If a druid's ashes or remains
are buried in the sacred grove, the character becomes <I>reincarnated</I>
(per the priest spell). The new incarnation appears within a mile of
the grove in 1d6 days.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Waters of Life.</B> Any source of water within the
grove has unusual healing properties. Anyone bathing in the water
(maximum of once per day per person) gains the benefit of
simultaneous <I>neutralize poison, cure disease</I>, and <I>cure
serious wounds</I> spells. The water loses all special properties
outside the grove's boundaries, however, so characters cannot use it
as a <I>healing</I> potion.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Scrying Pool.</B> A source of still water within
the grove, such as a pool or well, may be used for divination. Once
per day a druid can command the pool or well to act as a <I>reflecting
pool</I> cast at the druid's level.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Magic Fruit.</B> The grove has a tree whose fruit
or berries have a magical effect when eaten. In a given year, 1d6
fruits ripen, each with a distinct appearance to set it apart from
common fruit--lustrous golden apples, for example. The magic fruit's
effects are equivalent to one of the following:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> <I>Potion of animal control</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Potion of heroism</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Potion of longevity</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Potion of
treasure finding</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Philter of love</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Philter of glibness.</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Forbiddance.</B> A druid can invoke the<I> forbiddance</I>
power (per the spell) to cover the boundaries of the grove. The
effects can be called up only once per day and, once called, last one
hour per level of the druid.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Special. </B>The DM should devise a power
associated with the branch or kit of the first steward of the greater
magical sacred grove.</FONT></P>
