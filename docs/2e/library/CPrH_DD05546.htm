<P></P>
This force is a representation of all pure, natural power, including forces of
nature (such as waterfalls) and magical energies.
<P></P>
The priests of this force learn as much as they can of magic and try to pass
that learning along. They also don't like to see natural forces extensively
channelled by man; they often destroy dams, for instance.
<P></P>
Because they are devoted to powerful natural forces, priests of this force
tend to be magically powerful.
<P></P>
Lesser attributes of the Elemental Forces could be represented by actual gods.
The gods of Darkness, Fire, Light, and Lightning might be considered lesser
gods of this attribute.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Darkness/Night,
Dawn, Fertility, Fire, Light, Lightning, Love, Magic, Seasons, Sky/Weather,
Sun, Thunder, and Time.
<P></P>
<B>Alignment:</B> The forces being worshipped and protected are chaotic in nature, so all its
priests must be chaotic; they may be chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic
evil. Each branch has its own cult, so good priests don't have to be friends
with evil ones. The flock may be of any alignment.

priest, three third-level priests, and six first-level priests of the same
priesthood, plus one third-level mage and two first-level mages to act as consultants,
and five first-level fighters to act as guards. The priest may take the
following on adventures: Two priests, one mage, and two fighters of his choice. The
priesthood will pay for half of the cost of stronghold construction at 9th level.
Part of the stronghold must be a library devoted to elemental magics and the
elemental planes, and scholars interested in these subjects will visit the
stronghold in order to learn from the library or contribute to it.
