<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Set Snares:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The character can make simple snares and traps, primarily to catch small game.
These can include rope snares and spring traps. A proficiency check must be
rolled when the snare is first constructed and every time the snare is set. A
failed proficiency check means the trap does not work for some reason. It may be
that the workmanship was bad, the character left too much scent in the area, or
he poorly concealed the finished work. The exact nature of the problem does not
need to be known. The character can also attempt to set traps and snares for
larger creatures: tiger pits and net snares, for example. A proficiency check
must be rolled, this time with a -4 penalty to the ability score. In both cases,
setting a successful snare does not ensure that it catches anything, only that
the snare works if triggered. The DM must decide if the trap is triggered.

Thief characters (and only thieves) with this proficiency can also attempt to
rig man-traps. These can involve such things as crossbows, deadfalls, spiked
springboards, etc. The procedure is the same as that for setting a large snare.
The DM must determine the amount of damage caused by a man-trap.
<P></P>
Setting a small snare or trap takes one hour of work. Setting a larger trap
requires two to three people (only one need have the proficiency) and 2d4 hours
of work. Setting a man-trap requires one or more people (depending on its
nature) and 1d8 hours of work. To prepare any trap, the character must have
appropriate materials on hand.
<P></P>
Characters with animal lore proficiency gain a +2 bonus to their ability score
when attempting to set a snare for the purposes of catching game. Their
knowledge of animals and the woods serves them well for this purpose. They gain no
benefit when attempting to trap monsters or intelligent beings.
