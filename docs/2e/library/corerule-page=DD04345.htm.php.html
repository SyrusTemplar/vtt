This spell allows the priest to determine how one recent event fits into the
&quot;grand scheme.&quot; By casting this spell, the priest can determine whether the
sequence or situation that gave rise to the specific event is complete or whether
it is ongoing; whether it was a significant or insignificant event in the larger
picture; or whether it will continue to have repercussions for the
participants.
<P></P>
Using his knowledge of circumstances, the DM communicates these facts to the
caster's player. This &quot;arcane message&quot; is normally straightforward and easy to
understand, but in the case of highly complex circumstances, the message might
be cryptic. In any case, the message will always be truthful.
<P></P>
As an example, consider a priest and his party who are on a holy quest to
retrieve an item of power. On the way to the location of this item, the party is
ambushed by evil creatures from the Inner Planes but manages to defeat them.
Concerned that these creatures might be outlying guards protecting the item of
interest, the priest casts <I>consequence</I>, hoping for guidance. The DM knows that these creatures have nothing to do
with the quest; the encounter was coincidental. However, the surviving monsters
will soon be returning with reinforcements to avenge their dead. Therefore, the
DM tells the priest's player, &quot;To your goals these have no place, but still
they can cause more woe.&quot;
<P></P>
Casting this spell &quot;taints&quot; subsequent castings of the same spell within a
24-hour span. A second attempt within this period always results in the same
message as the first, regardless of the true situation. If a second priest casts the
spell within 24 hours of another casting, he receives an accurate reading.
<P></P>
The material component is three special coins or dice made of platinum (total
value of at least 1,000 gp), which the priest tosses in his hand while
concentrating on the spell. The coins or dice are not consumed in the casting.
