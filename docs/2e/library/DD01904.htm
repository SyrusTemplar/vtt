This spell has two effects. First, the wizard can cause normal arrows or
crossbow bolts to become magical flaming missiles for one round. The missiles must
be nocked and drawn (or cocked) at the completion of the spell. If they are not
loosed within one round, they are consumed by the magic. For every five levels
the caster has achieved, up to 10 arrows or bolts can be affected. The arrows
inflict normal damage, plus 1 point of fire damage to any target struck. They
may also cause incendiary damage. This version of the spell is used most often in
large battles.
<P></P>
The second version of this spell enables the caster to hurl fiery bolts at
opponents within range. Each bolt inflicts 1d6 points of piercing damage, plus 4d6
points of fire damage. Only half the fire damage is inflicted if the creature
struck successfully saves vs. spell. The caster receives one bolt for every
five experience levels (two bolts at 10th level, three at 15th level, etc.). Bolts
must be used on creatures within 20 yards of each other and in front of the
wizard.

The material components for this spell are a drop of oil and a small piece of
flint.
