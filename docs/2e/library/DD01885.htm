When this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end
of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular, as if
affixed at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an
extradimensional space. The spellcaster and up to seven others can climb up the rope and
disappear into this place of safety where no creature can find them. The rope can
be taken into the extradimensional space if fewer than eight persons have
climbed it; otherwise, it simply stays hanging in the air (extremely strong
creatures might be able to remove it, at the DM's option). Spells cannot be cast
across the interdimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the
extradimensional space can see out of it as if there were a 3-foot x 5-foot
window centered on the rope. The persons in the extradimensional space must climb
down prior to the end of the spell, or they are dropped from the height at which
they entered the extradimensional space. The rope can be climbed by only one
person at a time. Note that the <I>rope trick</I> spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the
way to the extradimensional space. Also note that creating or taking
extradimensional spaces into an existing extradimensional space is hazardous.

The material components of this spell are powdered corn extract and a twisted
loop of parchment.
