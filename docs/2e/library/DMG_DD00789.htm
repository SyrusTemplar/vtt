<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ring of Elemental Command:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The four types of elemental command rings are very powerful. Each appears to
be nothing more than an ordinary ring, but each has certain other powers as well
as the following common properties:
<P></P>
1. Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can't attack or even
approach within 5 feet of the wearer. If the wearer desires, he may forego this
protection and instead attempt to <I>charm</I> the elemental (saving throw applicable with a -2 penalty to the die). If the <I>charm</I> fails, however, total protection is lost and no further attempt at charming
can be made, but the secondary properties given below will then function with
respect to the elemental.
<P></P>
2. Creatures, other than normal elementals, from the plane to which the ring
is attuned attack with -1 penalties to their attack rolls. The ring wearer takes
damage at -1 on each die of damage and makes applicable saving throws from the
creature's attacks at +2. All attacks are made by the wearer of the ring with
a +4 bonus to the attack roll (or -4 on the elemental creature's saving throw),
and the wearer inflicts +6 damage (total, not per die) adjusted by any other
applicable bonuses and penalties. Any weapon used by the ring wearer can hit
elementals or elemental creatures even if it is not magical.
<P></P>
3. The wearer of the ring is able to converse with the elementals or elemental
creatures of the plane to which the ring is attuned. These creatures will
recognize that he wears the ring, and will show a healthy respect for the wearer,
if alignments are similar. If alignment is opposed, creatures will fear the
wearer if he is strong, hate and desire to slay him if the wearer is weak. Fear,
hatred, and respect are determined by the DM.
<P></P>
4. The possessor of a <I>ring of elemental command</I> suffers a saving throw penalty as follows:
