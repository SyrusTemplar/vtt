</B> Also travelers in some fashion, a guild of thieves who spend most of their
time engaged in piracy is a complex and shifting structure requiring careful
thought by the DM. There will obviously not be any form of guildhouse for such
thieves, although a small number of secret guild hidey-holes (caves in the cliffs,
deserted coves, desolate gull-haunted islands) could exist where spare equipment
and vital emergency supplies might be placed at strategic locations.
guildmasters could exist, but much more likely is a loosely-affiliated structure where
several senior thieves, maintaining their positions by force in most cases, are
equipotent. They might well all call themselves guildmaster! Such a guild would
have a very strong tendency towards chaotic alignments, and a nearly-equal
tendency towards evil.
<P></P>
Some type of organization and regularity would have to be imposed to make this
a guild at all. Meetings half-yearly, with a quorum for votes and decisions to
have any binding quality at all, would be a possibility. These could take
place in the major piratical port, perhaps a town or city of unparalleled iniquity
(what a place to send some PCs to track down the wicked pirates and stop their
evil trade in pressganging/slavery/drug smuggling, etc.). Certainly, some
mechanism for obtaining equipment and training (at the least) must exist.

For a notably more structured and stable rulership of a piratical-type
operation (slaving), see the adventure module <I>A1-4, Scourge of the Slavelords</I>.
