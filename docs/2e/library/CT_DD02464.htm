Opponents who are facing off across squares that are partially blocked by
solid obstacles may or may not be able to effectively attack one another. For
example, two opponents are facing each other diagonally where a wall corner abutts
the intersection of their squares. Half of the people using the <I>Player?s Option </I>combat system will argue that they can attack each other, and half of them
will argue against it. The same problem arises when considering whether or not
figures can occupy half squares (like any square that is bisected by a diagonal
wall). Some people will argue for such a rule, and some will argue against it.

The answer to these and other similar gray areas of figure placement and
movement is, it doesn?t really matter, as long as the solution is equitable. If
characters can attack around corners, then so can monsters. If you don?t want it to
happen, then it doesn?t?for characters or monsters. Neither choice skews the
system to favor anyone, so both solutions are equally viable. Just decide as a
group beforehand how you want to handle the situation, then stick with it. These
kinds of situations and conditions are way too numerous to mention or
adjudicate within these pages, but the guidelines set out above should give the DM and
players enough to work with.
