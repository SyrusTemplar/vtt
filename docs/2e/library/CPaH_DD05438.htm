   Whereas most paladins pledge fealty to churches, others may opt to serve a <I>sect</I>. Like churches, sects are religious organizations that worship one or more
gods, but they tend to be smaller and more secretive.
<P></P>
   Most sects usually begin as an outgrowth of an established church. A sect
leader and his followers separate from the church due to disagreements with church
leaders or because of a contradictory interpretation of religion doctrine. If a
sect flourishes and grows, it may eventually become a church itself.
<P></P>
   Some sects organize themselves around a single leader who has developed his
own set of religious principles. These may not have any formal ties to an
organized faith; in fact, some do not recognize the authority of other religious
leaders. They often spring up spontaneously, lasting no more than a single
generation.
<P></P>
   Some paladins avoid associations with any type of organized religion, instead
choosing to venerate a philosophy, a belief system based on intellectual
concepts rather than supernatural entities. Any philosophy serves as an acceptable
alternative to an organized religion, so long as it meets these qualifications:
<P></P>
• It presents a logical and self-consistent interpretation of the universe.
<P></P>
• It demands lawful good behavior of followers.
<P></P>
• It's broad enough to form the basis of the paladin's ethos.
<P></P>
   Paladins who follow a philosophy may worship privately or in small sects.
Meditation may substitute for prayer. A hill blanketed in violets may function as a
shrine. A book of poetry may take the place of a holy text.
<P></P>
   Regardless of whether a paladin has faith in a religion or philosophy all work
the same way in the context of the game. A paladin's devotion is sufficiently
intense to attract the magical energy necessary to cast spells and give him his
special powers. As with a lawful good religion, a lawful good philosophy
requires strict adherence to a set of lawful good principles, characterized by the
strictures and virtues of the paladin's ethos.
