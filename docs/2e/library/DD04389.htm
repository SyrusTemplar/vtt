This spell totally stops the flow of time for a single individual. All signs
of life stop and the subject is incapable of any movement or thought. While the
spell is in effect, the subject is totally immovable and cannot be affected by
any physical or magical forces. Weapons simply bounce off the subject as they
would bounce off the hardest stone. Spells, including <I>dispel magic</I>, are totally incapable of affecting the subject in any way. The subject does
not age.
<P></P>
Aside from the fact that the subject remains visible, frozen in place like a
statue, he is effectively no longer part of the universe. (DMs may rule that the
most powerful of magics, such as <I>wishe</I>s, and creatures of demigod or higher status can affect the subject.)
<P></P>
When the priest casts the spell, he or she states the duration for which the
spell will remain in effect (the maximum is one full day per level of the
caster). Once the spell is cast, this duration cannot be changed; the priest cannot
terminate the spell before the stated time has elapsed.
<P></P>
If the subject is unwilling to be affected by the spell, the priest must touch
the victim for the spell to take effect; the subject receives a normal saving
throw to resist the effects. A willing subject need not make a saving throw.
<P></P>
The priest may cast this spell on himself if desired. This spell can provide a
powerful defensive maneuver; while the spell is in effect, the subject is
totally invulnerable. <I>Timelessness</I> is also an effective form of long-term imprisonment, as long as the priest is
around to cast the spell again at the appropriate time.
<P></P>
This is an exceptionally powerful spell. Casting it puts a significant strain
on the priest. Each time he casts <I>timelessness</I>, the priest must make a system shock roll. If the priest fails this throw, he
or she permanently loses 1 point of Constitution.
<P></P>
The material components are a gem worth at least 1,000 gp and a small cylinder
of obsidian. Both are crushed during the casting.
