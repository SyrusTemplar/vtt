When a priest is trapped or otherwise endangered, this spell can summon help.
The spell creates a hovering, ghostly image of a hand about one foot high. The
caster can command it to locate a character or creature of the caster's choice
based on a physical description. The caster can specify race, sex, and
appearance, but not ambiguous factors such as level, alignment, or class.
<P></P>
After the hand receives its orders, it begins to search for the indicated
creature, flying at a movement rate of 48. The hand can search within a 5-mile
radius of the caster.
<P></P>
If the hand is unable to locate the indicated creature, it returns to the
caster (provided he is still within the area of effect). The hand displays an
outstretched palm, indicating that no such character or creature could be found. The
hand then disappears.
<P></P>
If the hand locates the indicated subject, the hand beckons the subject to
follow it. If the subject follows, the hand points in the direction of the caster,
leading the subject in the most direct, feasible route. The hand hovers 10
feet in front of the subject, moving before him. Once the hand leads the subject
to the caster, it disappears.
<P></P>
The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or help the caster. If the
subject chooses not to follow the hand, the hand continues to beckon for the
duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en
route to the caster, the hand disappears; the subject will have to rely on his
own devices to locate the caster.
<P></P>
If there is more than one subject within a 5-mile radius that meets the
caster's description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses
to follow the hand, the hand will not seek out a second subject.
<P></P>
The ghostly hand has no physical form. The hand can be seen only by the caster
and potential targets. It cannot engage in combat or execute any other task
aside from locating the subject and leading him back to the caster. The hand will
not pass through solid objects, but can pass through small cracks and slits.
<P></P>
The material component is a black silk glove.
