<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Appearance:</B> Kazerabet has a strong, forceful personality and an intellect so intense and
commanding that at first one may almost be tempted to forget to notice her
attractive face and figure. Her eyes are a spectacular steel gray, and they flash
like drawn daggers when she is angered. She has a proud and expressive mouth,
with ruby-painted lips that often curl into a pouting smile or a contemptuous
sneer. For important occasions, she puts on a platinum tiara that accents her eyes
(10,000 gp) and dresses in a full-length imperial robe, encrusted with
emeralds (7,500 gp). During more intimate audiences, she prefers a semi-translucent
gown, vaporous and sheer like a shroud of mist.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Background:</B> For the past two centuries, Kazerabet has been an eminent researcher, a
scholar, and a theoretician of the necromantic Arts. She practiced necromancy to
gain a greater knowledge of life by studying death, embracing the Art because it
was forbidden and mysterious. Kazerabet has always been fascinated by the
history of the Necromancer Kings of Sahu and their legacy of magical artifacts.
<P></P>
Kazerabet’s researches have taken her to Sahu, the Isle of the Necromancer
Kings, where she uncovered the Garden of Eternity hidden beneath the island. There
she has entered into a mutually beneficial pact with the lich-priestess
Vermissa (see her NPC sheet). In exchange for access to her ancient library and
assistance in attaining lichdom, Kazerabet has agreed to remove one of the nine
ancient glyphs keeping Vermissa imprisoned in the Garden.
<P></P>
Kazerabet is a neutral visitor in the Garden of Eternity. She is fascinated by
Vermissa, as she represents the history she has been studying for decades.
Although Kazerabet easily tolerates the presence of undead, she has no respect for
Vermissa’s living cult members and allies. She finds the necromancer Pizentios
(see his NPC sheet) particularly distasteful.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Role-Playing Notes:</B> Kazerabet carries herself with all the pride and dignity of exiled royalty.
She is an extremely private person and never discusses her past history or
future plans.
<P></P>
Though Kazerabet memorizes divinatory and defensive magics, she is fully
capable of unleashing a torrent of devastating spells (and barbazu) when provoked.
If she is seriously endangered, her <I>chain contingency</I> will activate (see “Special Defenses”), giving her time to release her
barbazu from her<I> iron bottle</I>, cast <I>time stop</I>, and ready her necromantic attacks. She will not hesitate to teleport away
from a lost battle so she can gate in a greater baatezu and prepare her own
ambush.
