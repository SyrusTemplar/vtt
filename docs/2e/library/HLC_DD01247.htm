Just like high-level heroes, some monsters have progressed in power to the
point where they are the most fearsome of their kind. Legendary monsters are not
just large or strong specimens, but instead they are a superior strain of their
race. The rules that follow are designed for non-humanoid monsters and can also
be combined with the <A HREF="DD01240.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01240.htm">Ability Scores for Monsters</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> section.
<P></P>
A legendary monster has the same movement rate, number of attacks, damage per
attack, morale rating, and special abilities as its normal counterpart. The
creature has increased Hit Dice, an improved Armor Class, and some additional
powers that the DM assigns. <A HREF="DD01248.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01248.htm">Table 12</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> details typical Hit Dice and Armor Class variances. When creating a legendary
monster, don-t forget to recalculate the creature's experience point value.

Lesser scions have two or three powers from <A HREF="DD01250.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01250.htm">Tables 13</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">?<A HREF="DD01273.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01273.htm">22</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
