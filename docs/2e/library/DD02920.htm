offspring of minotaurs and humans. Minotaurs are powerfully built and tower more than
seven feet in height, with the head of a bull and the body of a human male.
Minotaurs revere physical strength above all else, and they believe that the strong
should naturally rule the weak. Minotaurs view surrender as an admission of
weakness, and are likely to fight to the death regardless of the circumstances.

Many minotaurs are brutal savages, but they are not always mindless killers.
They are ruthless, harsh, and stubborn, but they can be surprisingly intelligent
and introspective.
