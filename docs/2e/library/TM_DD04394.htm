<P></P>
Sphere: Sun
<P></P>
Range: 200 yards
<P></P>

By casting <I>circle of sunmotes</I>, the priest creates a hemispherical shell filled with sparkling, glowing
motes of bright sunlight. A one-foot radius globe of sunlight appears at the height
of the caster's head in the exact center of the circle.
<P></P>
Creatures within the area of effect who are friendly to the cleric experience
the glowing motes as warm, invigorating, inspiring, and healing. They are
healed for 1d6 hit points, gain the benefit of an <I>aid</I> spell for 1 turn after the <I>circle of sunmotes</I> is created, gain +1 bonuses to all attack and damage rolls, and gain a +2
bonus to morale.
<P></P>
Enemies of the priest experience the same sunmotes as blinding, burning, and
damaging. They must save versus spell or be blinded for 1 turn after the
sunmotes are created. Each enemy is struck by a small fiery mote causing 1d4+1 points
of damage (no saving throw is allowed, but creatures with magical fire
resistance suffer only half damage), and suffers a -2 penalty to morale.
<P></P>
Companions of the cleric who step within 10 feet of the glowing miniature sun
at the center of the effect are healed of 1d8+2 hit points. This affects each
creature only once during the spell's duration.
<P></P>
Enemies of the priest who come within 10 feet of the minisun are burned for
1d8+2 points of fire damage. No saving throw is allowed, but creatures possessing
magical resistance against fire suffer only half damage.
<P></P>
Companions of the priest who are outside the area of effect view enemies
within the circle as if they are affected by golden <I>faerie fire</I>. Creatures affected by the <I>faerie fire</I> suffer a -2 penalty to armor class from attacks by creatures outside the
circle.
<P></P>
Enemies of the priest outside the circle view the priest's allies as if
obscured by a blinding light and suffer a -2 penalty to missile attacks against them.
