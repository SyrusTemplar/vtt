<FONT SIZE="3">By means of this spell, the wizard and up to six other
creatures joined by linked hands become <I>ethereal </I>(along with
their equipment). While ethereal, the group need not stay together.
The group&#146;s presence can be detected only by <I>detect phase,
true seeing, </I>or similar spells and effects. No physical, or
magical attack can affect him, unless his assailant is ethereal as
well (although some monsters, such as the basilisk, have gaze weapons
whose power extends into the Ethereal Plane). The spell recipients
are actually in the Border Ethereal and can still perceive their
physical surroundings, but the world appears gray, misty, and
indistinct to them. Note that as ethereal creatures can perceive the
physical world here, a character could scout out his surroundings or
make good an escape from the safety of the Border Ethereal.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The wizard and his companions may remain in the Border
Ethereal for up to one hour per level; when the spell expires, they
return to normal existence, although the wizard can choose to end the
spell before its full duration. The wizard also has the option of
moving himself or the group from the Border Ethereal into the Deep
Ethereal, in which case they remain ethereal when the spell ends. He
will have to use this spell again or find another way back in order
to return to his home plane.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The wizard can attempt to use <I>etherealness </I>to
banish an unwilling subject. He must make a successful attack roll in
order to touch him, and the subject receives a saving throw vs. spell
to negate the effect. An unwilling subject automatically remains in
the Border Ethereal for an amount of time specified by the wizard at
the time of the casting, but no more than one hour per caster level.
When used like this, etherealness does not affect the caster, only
the subject.</FONT></P>
