his spells. The school of enchantment/charm also includes a number of spells
that imbue nonliving items with magical powers. Because the greater part of their
spell selection involves influencing other people, enchanters must have a
Charisma (Charisma/ Appearance, under <A HREF="corerule-page%3dSP_DD02882.htm.php.html#f1d2b908"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dSP_DD02882.htm.php.html#f1d2b908">Skills &amp; Powers</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I> </I>rules) score of 16 or higher. Enchantment/charm is opposed by invocation/
evocation and necromancy.

Enchanters have the usual benefits and restrictions of a specialist wizard. In
addition, when an enchanter reaches 11th level, he gains the ability to cast a
special <I>free action </I>spell once per day on himself or any creature he touches. The casting time is
only 1, and no material components are required; the spell duplicates the
effects of the 4th-level priest spell <I>free action </I>and lasts for one hour. At 14th level, the enchanter acquires immunity to all
forms of the <I>charm </I>spell.

While the enchanter’s spells are not spectacular in effect, they are also
among the subtlest of spells. In many cases, turning an enemy into an ally is far
more effective and desirable than simply incinerating him, and enchanters excel
at mind-affecting magic. Careful interrogation of <I>charmed </I>enemies can also provide a wealth of useful information for the enchanter.
