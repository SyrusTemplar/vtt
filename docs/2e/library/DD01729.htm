<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Some creatures or items strongly resist the effects of magic (or impart such
resistance to others). This makes them more difficult to affect with magical
energy than ordinary creatures or items.
<P></P>
A rare few creatures are extremely anti-magical--magic rolls off them like
water off a duck's back. More common are creatures, especially from the Outer
Planes of existence, that live in enchanted or sorcerous lands and are filled with
powerful magical energies. These creatures eat and breathe the vapors of
wizardry, and they have a high tolerance against arcane power.
<P></P>
Magic resistance is an innate ability--that is, the possessor does not have to
do anything special to use it. The creature need not even be aware of the
threat for his magic resistance to operate. Such resistance is part of the creature
or item and cannot be separated from it. (Creatures, however, can voluntarily
lower their magic resistance at will.)
<P></P>
Magic resistance is also an individual ability. A creature with magic
resistance <I>cannot</I> impart this power to others by holding their hands or standing in their
midst. Only the rarest of creatures and magical items have the ability to bestow
magic resistance upon another.
<P></P>
Magic resistance is given as a percentile number. For a magical effect to have
any chance of success, the magic resistance must be overcome. The target (the
one with the magic resistance) rolls percentile dice. If the roll is higher
than the creature's magic resistance, the spell has a normal effect. If the roll
is equal to or less than the creature's magic resistance, the spell has
absolutely no effect on the creature.
