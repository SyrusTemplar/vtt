<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This engine usually consists of some sort of lever mounted on a sturdy frame.
The lever acts as a throwing arm and is fitted with a cup or sling to hold the
projectile. When fired, a catapult lobs the projectile high into the air.
Tension provides the catapult’s power. In primitive catapults, the lever was made
from some flexible material (usually green wood) and provided its own power when
it was bent back and released. More sophisticated catapults were equipped with
a rigid arm powered by a mass of twisted skeins (usually horsehair). Ancient
catapults often resembled ballistae aimed upward to fire indirectly; all types of
catapults use the same basic statistics.
<P></P>
Catapults usually fire large stones, but they can be loaded with almost
anything: small stones, chains, dead animals, or anything else small enough to fit in
the sling or cup and not so heavy that it overloads the lever. Large objects
inflict the damage listed on the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02742.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02742.htm.php.html">table</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">. Masses of small objects can inflict an extra die of damage against most
creatures but are useless against structures and any creature with a natural Armor
Class of 0 or better (including characters with an Armor Class of 0 before
shield or Dexterity modifiers).

A light catapult with a full crew can target Huge creatures.

A light or medium catapult can change facing 45 degrees during the
End-of-Round step of any round when it fires. Heavy catapults generally are left in place
once they are sited for a battle. A full crew can change a heavy catapult’s
facing after 20 minutes of work.
