</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Encounters are the heart of the AD&amp;D game. Since encounters with monsters and
NPCs often lead to combat, an understanding of what happens during battles is
vital for everyone. There are several factors the DM will consider in any
combat, most of which arise from the circumstances of the encounter. Is anyone
surprised? How far apart are the opponents? How many of them are there? Answers to
these questions are found in the <A HREF="DMG_DD00558.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00558.htm">Encounter</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> section of the DMG. These are questions common to all encounters, whether
combat occurs or not.
