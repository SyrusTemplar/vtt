A wizard must meet certain ability requirements to become a specialist. For
instance, a wizard with a Dexterity of 15 can't become an illusionist. But even
if low ability scores haven't eliminated all of the specialization choices, the
player should still look at his character's Intelligence score and see how it
affects his chance of learning spells. An Intelligence of 9 means that the
character will have a 50 percent chance to learn spells of his speciality based on
the normal 35 percent chance to learn a new spell for an Intelligence of 9 (<A HREF="PHB_DD01432.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01432.htm">Table 4</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> on page 16 of the <I>Player's Handbook</I> ) plus a 15 percent bonus for being a specialist.

An Intelligence of 17 means that the character will have a 90 percent chance
to learn spells of his specialty (the normal 75 percent chance for an
Intelligence of 17 plus a 15 percent bonus for being a specialist). Notice that the 15
percent bonus helps the character with the lower Intelligence more than it does
the character with the higher Intelligence; the bonus boosts the Intelligence 9
character's chance from 35 to 50, an increase of more than 40 percent, while
the Intelligence 17 character's chance is increased from 75 to 90, which is a
boost of only 20 percent.

Clearly, the lower the Intelligence of a wizard, the more specialization helps
to increase his chance of learning spells. This is somewhat offset by the
specialist's limitations to which spells he can learn (he can't learn spells from
oppositional schools), but over the course of a campaign, a low Intelligence
wizard stands a good chance of learning more spells by specializing
