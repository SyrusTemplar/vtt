This spell allows a wizard's staff to store one spell level for every three
levels of the caster. Thus, a 9th-level wizard can store three spell levels
(three 1st-level spells, one 1st and one 2nd, or one 3rd-level spell).
<P></P>
Spells that are to be stored in the staff must be memorized normally by the
wizard. The spells are then cast as normal when charging the staff; casting
requires the spell's normal casting time plus one round. The spell is wiped from
memory and material components are consumed. All spells to be stored must be cast
into the staff within 1 turn.
<P></P>
All stored spells have a casting time of 1.
<P></P>
Spells remain in the staff until cast or dispelled, or up to 1 hour per level
of the caster. After this time, all stored spells fade away.
<P></P>
Only wizards who know the <I>magic staff</I> spell can cast spells from another wizard's staff. This applies to wizards
who have never learned or could not normally cast the spells stored in a staff.
It is common, however, for the staff's owner to implement a command word which
must be known by anyone wishing to use the staff.
<P></P>
The material component for this spell is a staff cut from an ash tree. For
each spell level the wizard intends to imbue into the staff, it must be inlaid
with rubies worth at least 1,000 gp.
