have a Charisma of at least 14.

and acts in all respects as a <I>magical weapon +1</I>; it can even harm monsters that can only be hit by magical weapons. The
weapon may be +2 or higher and/or have added bonuses when used to attack certain
types of monsters, such as undead. The blessed weapon belongs to his church and he
is charged with its care. It may never be lent and, if lost, his paramount
