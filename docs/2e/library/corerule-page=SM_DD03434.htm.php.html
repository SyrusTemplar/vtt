Naturally, wizards and priests aren’t the only spellcasters in the AD&amp;D game.
Rangers, paladins, and bards are all capable of casting spells. In addition, a
variety of monsters cast spells as well, or make use of spell-like powers.
While magic is a secondary skill for most of these characters, it is a very potent
tool—or weapon—and can provide significant advantages even at low levels. For
example, a bard with <I>spider climb, comprehend languages</I>, and <I>clairaudience </I>will never have to worry about missing a crucial climb walls, detect noise, or
read languages roll.

In this chapter, we’ll take a look at some of these other spellcasters and
their magical abilities. A character who combines the basic skills of another
class with some degree of magical ability is extremely flexible and effective. And
of course, villains with a similar range of powers are among the most dangerous
enemies a PC party can face.

and custom-designed characters; paladins, rangers, and minor spellcasters;
multi-classed characters; and monsters with magical powers. Bards, paladins, and
rangers may all make use of the optional spell point rules presented in <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03506.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03506.htm.php.html">Chapter 6</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> .
