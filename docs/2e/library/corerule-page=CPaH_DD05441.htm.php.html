   Orders are honorary organizations whose members are distinguished by careers
of exceptional service. As invitations to join are extended only to a select
few, most paladins view membership as a profound privilege and great accolades.
<P></P>
   Whereas some orders exist merely as social clubs, providing fellowship in an
informal atmosphere, others perform a variety of civic activities, such as
charity drives and educational programs. Regardless of its function, each order
maintains its own membership qualifications, hierarchies, and bylaws.
<P></P>
   Orders are entirely optional. A DM is never required to include a particular
order in his campaign, nor is a paladin character ever obligated to join. In any
case, treat an invitation as a major event. The DM should not devalue the
prestige of membership by offering invitations casually or as prizes for routine
performance; typically, a paladin receives an invitation only once in his life.
<P></P>
   Several sample orders are described below. A campaign may include any, all, or
just one of them. The DM is free to modify or adapt the descriptions as he
sees fit, or invent new orders of his own.
<P></P>
   The standard information below applies to all orders; the individual entries
that follow include supplemental material. Additionally, each entry lists an
emblem and a motto. A candidate repeats the motto when he accepts membership; most
orders recite the motto to open and close their meetings.
