<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fire Resistance:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This potion bestows upon the person drinking it magical invulnerability to all
forms of normal fire (such as bonfires, burning oil, or even huge pyres of
flaming wood). It also gives resistance to fires generated by molten lava, a <I>wall of fire,</I> a <I>fireball,</I> fiery dragon breath, and similar intense flame/heat. All damage from such
fires is reduced by -2 from each die of damage, and if a saving throw is
applicable, it is rolled with a +4 bonus. If one-half of the potion is consumed, it
confers invulnerability to normal fires and half the benefits noted above (-1, +2).
The potion lasts one turn, or five rounds for half doses.
