There are actually four spells in the <I>conjure elemental</I> spell. The wizard is able to conjure an air, earth, fire, or water elemental
with this spell--assuming he has the material component for the particular
elemental. (A considerable fire source must be in range to conjure a fire
elemental; a large amount of water must be available to conjure a water elemental.)
Conjured elementals have 8 Hit Dice.
<P></P>
It is possible to conjure successive elementals of different types if the
spellcaster has memorized two or more of these spells. The type of elemental to be
conjured must be decided upon before memorizing the spell. Each type of
elemental can be conjured only once per day.
<P></P>
The conjured elemental must be controlled by the wizard--the spellcaster must
concentrate on the elemental doing his commands--or it turns on the wizard and
attacks. The elemental will not break off a combat to do so, but it will avoid
creatures while seeking its conjurer. If the wizard is wounded or grappled, his
concentration is broken. There is always a 5% chance that the elemental turns
on its conjurer regardless of concentration. This check is made at the end of
the second and each succeeding round. An elemental that breaks free of its
control can be dispelled by the caster, but the chance of success is only 50%. The
elemental can be controlled up to 30 yards away per level of the spellcaster.
The elemental remains until its form on this plane is destroyed due to damage or
until the spell's duration expires. Note that water elementals are destroyed if
they are ever more than 60 yards from a large body of water.
<P></P>
The material component of the spell (besides the quantity of the element at
hand) is a small amount of one of the following:
<P></P>
<P></P>
Air Elemental--burning incense
<P></P>
Earth Elemental--soft clay
<P></P>
Fire Elemental--sulphur and phosphorus
<P></P>
Water Elemental--water and sand
<P></P>
<P></P>
Special protection from uncontrolled elementals is available by means of a <I>protection from evil</I> spell.
