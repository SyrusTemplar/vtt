</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">To be a dual-classed thief/necromancer, the character must have a minimum 15
Dex and 17 Int (including, of course, the minimum 16 Wis of the necromancer).
This combination does not have many advantages, though. From the character-s
perspective, the combat abilities (hit points and THAC0) of the rogue are only
marginally better than that of the wizard. In addition, even at low levels, a
wizard-s spells can dramatically overshadow a thief-s mundane abilities. For
instance, who would not prefer a <I>spider climb</I> spell over the usual climb walls ability? Why pick a lock when you can <I>knock</I>?
<P></P>
The trap detection and lock picking abilities of a thief would greatly benefit
a subtle necromancer who enjoyed tomb robbing, but remember that once the
wizard can <I>animate dead</I>, the importance of such skills may be greatly reduced (as noted in the
Introduction). Perhaps another exception to this rule is the Anatomist or any other
necromancer who must regularly work at the heart of civilization. For the
Anatomist, who needs a steady supply of stolen bodies, a rogue-s skills might prove
indispensable. Moving silently and hiding in shadows, for instance, are
practically impossible to duplicate without spells from the Illusion school (which is
forbidden to all necromancers).
<P></P>
From the DM-s perspective, a rogue-s percentage ability scores are
considerably more difficult to generate than those of the warrior. As with the fighter, a
dual-classed thief/necromancer character will not have advanced to name (10th)
level before changing professions. The DM can quickly determine the character-s
level of experience as a thief by rolling 1d8+1 (resulting in 2nd to 9th
level).
