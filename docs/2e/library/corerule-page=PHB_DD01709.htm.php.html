<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> When dealing with nonhumanoid opponents, a number of factors must be
considered.
<P></P>
First, unintelligent creatures, as a rule, never try to grapple, punch, or
pull down an opponent. They cheerfully settle for tearing him apart, limb by limb.
This, to their small and animalistic minds, is a better solution.
<P></P>
Second, the natural weapon of a creature are always usable. Unlike men with
swords, a lion or a carnivorous ape doesn't lose the use of its teeth and fangs
just because a character is very close to it.
<P></P>
Finally, and of greatest importance, creatures tend to be better natural
fighters than humans. All attacks for a tiger are the same as punching or wrestling.
It's just that the tiger has claws! Furthermore, a tiger can use all of its
legs effectively--front and back.
