<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Subdual Attacks </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">It is possible to employ most common weapons in a generally nonlethal manner
by striking only with the haft or flat of the blade. For some weapons, it is
possible for the attacker to reverse his grip and use the weapon?s butt or pommel
as a club.
<P></P>
To make a subdual attack, a character makes an attack roll vs. the opponent?s
normal Armor Class. There is ?4 attack penalty and the weapon?s damage is
reduced by half; round fractions up. Subdual attacks are treated as armed melee
attacks in all other ways.
<P></P>
Characters who are entitled to multiple melee attacks can make multiple
subdual attacks. All bonuses for Strength, expertise, specialization, and mastery
apply to subdual attacks. Any damage inflicted is three quarters temporary, just
as in brawling attacks. Creatures reduced to zero hit points or less fall
unconscious just as in brawling combat. If you don?t want to bother with dividing
subdual damage in half, then dividing by four, roll a smaller die for damage
instead. For example, roll 1d4 for a long sword, 1d3+1 for a footman?s mace, and 1d4
for a morning star. A critical hit with a subdual attack causes a blunt
critical effect (see <A HREF="DD02717.htm#bcdf214c"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02717.htm#bcdf214c">Chapter Six</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) or forces the target to roll a successful saving throw vs. death to avoid
being knocked out for 3d10 combat rounds. There is no saving throw adjustment for
the attacker?s Strength as there is in pummeling attacks.
