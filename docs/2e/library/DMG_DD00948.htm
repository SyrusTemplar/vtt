<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Gauntlets of Fumbling:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">These gauntlets may be of supple leather or heavy protective material suitable
for use with armor (ring, scale, chain, etc.). In the former instance, these
will appear to be <I>gauntlets of dexterity;</I> in the latter case, they will appear to be <I>gauntlets of ogre power.</I> They will perform according to every test as if they were <I>gauntlets of dexterity</I> or <I>ogre power</I> until the wearer finds himself under attack or in a life and death situation.
At that time, the curse is activated, and the wearer will become very clumsy,
with a 50% chance each round of dropping anything held in either handâ€”not from
both singly. The gauntlets will also lower overall Dexterity by 2 points. Once
the curse is activated, the gloves can be removed only by means of a <I>remove curse</I> spell or a <I>wish.</I>
