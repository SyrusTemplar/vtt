<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Contact</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">: This proficiency gives characters access to the psionic attack forms
necessary to open a closed mind. Contact allows characters to gain psionic attacks as
they become available with level advancement.
<P></P>
Psionicists automatically receive this proficiency. It doesn-t take up any of
their available slots. As a psionicist increases in level, he automatically
receives psionic attack forms as outlined on the <A HREF="DD03222.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03222.htm">Psionic Progression table</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. Psionic attack forms don-t fill up a psionicist's proficiency slots.
<P></P>
Wild talents, on the other hand, must select contact and place it in an
available nonweapon proficiency slot if they want to gain its benefits. Once contact
is slotted, a wild talent selects one psionic attack. He may select an
additional attack by placing it in an available nonweapon slot after he has advanced
the appropriate number of levels, according to his group's progression rate. Wild
talents may never have more than three of the five psionic attack forms.
