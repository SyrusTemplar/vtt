<TITLE>Claw of Magic Stealing-- Miscellaneous Magic (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Claw of Magic Stealing:</B> This peculiar item is usually fashioned in the form of a miniature silver
hand or claw. An attempt to identify it will suggest that it is an item capable of
casting the 2nd-level wizard spell <I>spectral hand </I>three times per day. The claw can indeed do this, but this is only its
secondary function.
<P></P>
The claw's real purpose is to steal spells from other spellcasters. If the
victim of the <I>spectral hand</I> spell is a wizard, he must make a saving throw versus spell. Failure to make
this save means that a randomly selected spell is drained from his memory and
its energy is transferred to the claw's owner. The owner of the claw may then
use this magical energy to &quot;power&quot; a memorized spell of his own, provided it is
of the same or lower level. Such a spell may be cast without being lost from the
mind of the wizard possessing the claw.
<P></P>
The <I>claw of magic stealing</I> does not store magical energy in any way; either the owner of the claw uses
the energy to &quot;power&quot; a spell on the next round, or the energy dissipates and is
lost.
