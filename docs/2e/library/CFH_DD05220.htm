Take a look at Chapter Nine of the <I>Dungeon Master's Guide</I>, page 58.
<P></P>
As you'll see in those rules, when you wish to make a Called Shot, you
announce this before initiative is rolled, and you receive a +1 penalty to your
initiative. Then, when your turn comes up in combat, you suffer a â€“4 penalty to your
attack roll. Naturally, you can take Called Shots with melee, thrown, and
missile weapons, and even with weapon-like spells such as <I>magic missile.</I>
<P></P>
Called Shots can be used for a variety of purposes. The most important of
these are: Disarming a weapon; striking a specific body part; smashing something
being held; bypassing armor; and special results.
<P></P>
Disarming a weapon warrants its own maneuver, so you'll find &quot;Disarm&quot; below.
