Founded at the same time as the monarchy of the Necromancer Kings on the
island of Sahu, this religious organization of priests and necromancers is dedicated
to the baatezu lord Thasmudyan. The ancient god of Undead was worshiped on
Sahu long before the arrival of the Necromancer Kings, and perhaps the Cult of
Worms in some way reflects ancient religious practices forbidden since the times
of earliest antiquity. Regardless of its sinister primeval origins, the cult
still survives today as a secret society. Its members have wormed their way into
all the nearby governments and principalities.
<P></P>
The high priestess of the cult, a mysterious figure revered only beyond the
lands of Sahu as the Undying One, is a lich named Vermissa. The cult's current
purpose is to secure Vermissa's freedom from a prison established by the first
Necromancer King. Its members recruit powerful necromancers from the surrounding
realms, enticing them to the island of Sahu with promises of magical power and
lichdom. In exchange for such knowledge, Vermissa demands that the wizard
destroy one of the nine magical seals keeping her imprisoned on Sahu. Vermissa has
not yet revealed any of her long-term (post-freedom) goals to her followers, but
her ambitions have always been lofty, and spurred by centuries of
imprisonment, the clever lich has had concocted a grand infernal scheme. Vermissa, the Cult
of Worms, and the heritage of the Necromancer Kings are all featured in the
sample campaign in Chapter Nine.
