Even a scratch from a legendary monster can infect a character with a fatal
malady. Each time a monster with this power makes a successful physical attack,
secretly roll 1d100. If the result is equal to or less than the damage inflicted
during the attack, the opponent contracts a disease. If the creature strikes
an opponent multiple times in a single round, check for disease only once and
use the total damage inflicted for the check. For example, if a creature strikes
an opponent twice for 17 points of damage with the first hit and 21 points of
damage with the second blow, the opponent contracts a disease on a roll of 38 or
less.
