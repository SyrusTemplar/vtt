<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Wand of Element Transmogrification:</B> This wand changes a quantity of one element into an equal amount of another
element (water into fire, earth into air, etc.). The element to be affected must
be within 60 feet of the wielder, who merely points the wand at the element
and speaks the command word. For every 10 cubic feet (or portion thereof)
transformed, one charge is drained from the wand.
<P></P>
The transmogrification is permanent unless a successful <I>dispel magic</I> is cast on the element.
<P></P>
Elements created by this wand have special characteristics. Fire requires no
fuel to burn. Water never evaporates. Air is absolutely pure, but unless
contained, the air mingles with the atmosphere and is lost forever. Earth can appear
as soil, sand, clay, or stone, at the wielder's option. It is not possible to
create treasure such as valuable metals or gemstones with this wand.
<P></P>
This wand has no effect upon creatures of any kind, except those from the
Elemental planes. By changing such creatures into their element of opposition (fire
into water, air into earth, etc.), the creature is totally obliterated. Thus,
transmuting a water elemental into fire disintegrates it.
<P></P>
A creature attacked by the wand is allowed a saving throw vs. rods, staves,
and wands. If the save is failed, the elemental is destroyed. If the save is
successful, the creature is not obliterated outright, but suffers 6d6 points of
damage and retains its true form.
<P></P>
In attacking an elemental, the number of Hit Dice of the elemental determines
the number of charges used: 1 charge for an 8 HD elemental, 2 charges for a 12
HD elemental, and 3 charges for a 16 HD elemental. It is not possible to use
this wand to change an elemental into another type of elemental.
<P></P>
The wand may be used once per round. It may be recharged.
