   <B>Description:</B> The Medician seeks to treat the sick, alleviate suffering, and save lives.
Much of her training has been devoted to medical arts, and she follows a religion
whose deities promote healing and compassion. On the battlefield, she is as
likely to be found comforting a wounded comrade as engaging an enemy in
swordplay. Though as much an enemy of evil as any paladin, the Medician has decided that
she can best uphold her principles by fighting injury and disease.
<P></P>
  <B>Requirements:</B> The Medician must have an Intelligence score of at least 10.
<P></P>
   <B>Ministration:</B> Any.
<P></P>
 <B>  Role:</B> A Medician candidate undergoes rigorous training in a variety of demanding
courses, including herbalism, anatomy, and diagnostics. After completing her
academic studies, she must spend at least a year as an apprentice to an experienced
medical practitioner. Because of the length of her training, a candidate
rarely becomes a 1st-level Medician before she reaches her early-to-mid twenties.
<P></P>
   A Medician assumes the role of healer whether at home or in the field with an
adventuring party. She brews antidotes for poisons, sets broken bones, applies
poultices to festering wounds, and stays up all night with ailing mounts. In
her free time, the Medician experiments with new treatments, develops new
diagnostic techniques, and compiles notes of past cases to share with other healers.
<P></P>
   A Medician will never abandon or neglect wounded, diseased, or suffering
lawful good characters (or creatures). Should no lawful good patients require
attention, most Medicians will apply their skills to neutral characters and
creatures. However, only in extraordinary circumstances will a Medician knowingly treat
an evil character or creature.
<P></P>
   <B>Symbol:</B> A holy symbol with a heart, open hand, silhouette of an infant, cross, or
drop of blood.
<P></P>
   <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Farmer, Groom, Scribe.
<P></P>
   <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> The Medician spends so much time with academic studies that her combat skills
invariably suffer. Therefore, the Medician has only <I>one</I> weapon proficiency at 1st level; this slot must be spent on either lance
(any), battle axe, or sword (any). She receives a second weapon proficiency at 3rd
level and a third at 6th level; she receives a total of three weapon
proficiencies for her entire career. She may chose any weapon to fill her second and
third slots.
<P></P>
 <B>  Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonus:</I> Diagnostics*, Healing. <I>Limit:</I> Because her mastery of the healing arts comes at the expense of other skills,
a Medician may acquire no more than three proficiencies beyond her bonuses.
She has only a single proficiency slot to spend at 1st level, another at 3rd
level, and a final slot at 6th level. <I>Recommended:</I> Ancient History, Animal Handling, Animal Lore, Animal Training, Heraldry,
Herbalism, Languages (Ancient or Modern), Reading/Writing, Religion, Riding
(Airborne or Land-based). <I>Forbidden:</I> Blind-fighting, Bowyer/Fletcher, Jousting*, Weaponsmithing.
<P></P>
   <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> In addition to her standard equipment, the Medician must purchase and
maintain a set of healing equipment. A typical set includes needles for stitching
wounds, cloth bandages, tourniquets, splints, sterilizing ointments, and a
selection of non-magical potions and herbs (for soothing headaches, settling stomachs,
and reducing fevers; these items don't heal damage). The initial cost of a kit
is 50 gp. At least once a month, the Medician must replenish her kit either by
buying new supplies (1-4 gp) or scavenging them (which takes 1-4 days). Until
the Medician replenishes her kit, she can't take advantage of any of the
proficiency bonuses listed in the Special Benefits section. The kit weighs 1 lb.
<P></P>
 <B>  Bonded Mount:</B> Any.
<P></P>
   <B>Special Benefits:
<P></P>
</B>   A Medician has all of the following proficiency bonuses:
<P></P>
• A +1 bonus to all Diagnostics proficiency checks. (If the Medician acquires
the Herbalism proficiency, she has an additional +3 bonus; this brings the
total Diagnostics bonus to +4. See Chapter 5 for the Diagnostics proficiency.)
<P></P>
• A +1 bonus for all Healing proficiency checks. A successful check enables
her to restore 1d4 points of damage if applied within three rounds of wounding
(instead of 1-3 points within one round).
<P></P>
• If under the care of a Medician, a patient recovers 1 additional hit point
per day (2 points per day if the patient travels, and 4 points per day if the
patient rests).
<P></P>
• If a Medician spends five consecutive rounds caring for a poisoned patient,
the patient receives a +4 bonus to his saving throw (made at the end of five
rounds). If the care is interrupted, the patient saves normally.
<P></P>
 <B>  Special Hindrances:
<P></P>
</B>   Once per year, a Medician must suspend all normal activities and spend 2-5
(1d4+1) consecutive weeks at a university, hospital, monastery, or any other
lawful good institution that offers both religious and medical training. During this
period, the Medician refreshes her skills through prayer and study. Failure to
comply results in the loss of all proficiency bonuses listed in the Special
Benefits section. As a punishment from her deity, the Medician also loses her
disease immunity and the ability to heal by laying on hands. She regains all
benefits and special abilities as soon as she completes a 2-5 week stay.
