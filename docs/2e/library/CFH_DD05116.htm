The cost of the workshop constitutes only the set-up cost for the armoring
operation. Maintenance of the workshop, pay for the employees, and cost of
materials also come into play. Of course, so do the profits from the sale of
manufactured goods.
<P></P>
Each apprentice costs 2gp/week for food, upkeep, and training. And once an
apprentices has reached young adulthood (age 16) and has achieved an Armorer
ability check of 12 or better, he'll demand to be promoted to Overseer status
(described immediately below) or will find better pickings elsewhere.
<P></P>
Apprentices cannot run a workshop unsupervised. Supervision comes in the form
of an Overseer, an adult with an Armorer ability check of 12 or better. Each
Overseer costs 15 gp/week (the DM may wish to have the cost relate to the
Overseer's Armorer ability check: 15 gp/week at a check of 12, +15 gp/week per +1 to
his ability check; thus, if his ability check is 16, he costs 75 gp/week).
