Grinding down a high-level character is difficult, and the task is often
monotonous for the DM and frustrating for the player. It is much better to look for
ways to undermine player confidence and to keep them from feeling cocky.
<P></P>
The best way to take players down a notch is to get personal by attacking
specific player character strengths. The lowly 2nd-level priest spell <I>silence 15? radius</I> is a great way to remind high-level spellcasters that they don-t run the
world. <I>Antimagic shells, scrolls of protection from magic</I>, and the occasional magic dead zone are more potent ways to keep spellcasters
in line. In a similar vein, thieves can find <I>magic mouth</I> spells very annoying and fighters often have difficulty acting heroic when
their weapons and armor have been subjected to<I> heat metal</I> spells and rust monster attacks.
<P></P>
Players can be their own worst enemies when it comes to inflicting mental
anguish on themselves. The simple ploy of presenting a party with a foe they cannot
detect often has players assuming the worst. For example, a few bow
specialists who have used <I>dust of disappearance</I> on themselves and consumed <I>potions of speed</I> can send a hail of missiles at a party, leading the players to assume they
are surrounded and outnumbered when, in fact, they-re simply the targets of
harassment.
<P></P>
Trying to design lethal adventures can be harmful to the campaign in other
ways. As <A HREF="DD01178.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01178.htm">Chapter One</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> pointed out, increasingly lethal adventures tend to make players want to
retire their characters before their luck runs out. Also, remember that
outrageously powerful magical items used against the PCs in one adventure are going to be
used on the monsters who oppose them all too soon.
