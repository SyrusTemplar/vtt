This cooperative spell can be cast by either a single priest or a group of
priests. <I>Thoughtwave</I> allows the priest to send a short but powerful message to one or more
specific individuals, informing them of his situation and general location. The spell
instantly generates a powerful mental impulse indicative of the caster's
general mental state--anger, fear, pain, despair, etc.
<P></P>
The caster can designate as many as ten persons to receive this message,
provided they can all be specifically named or grouped in a general category. Thus,
the caster could designate a group of characters by name or could target
&quot;fellow priests,&quot; &quot;superiors,&quot; &quot;adventuring companions,&quot; &quot;knights of Lord Harcourt,&quot;
or &quot;villagers of Dopp.&quot; If more than ten individuals are in the group, those
closest to the source will receive the impulse.
<P></P>
There is no range limitation to the spell, although it cannot be projected
outside the plane occupied by the caster.
<P></P>
Creatures receiving the impulse automatically know who sent it (even if they
have never met the priest before) and gain a clear indication of the mood and
situation of the caster. Recipients also intuitively know the general source of
the spell, although they are unable to pinpoint rooms, dungeon levels, or
landmarks. For example, a fighter could suddenly be struck by an image of Father
Rastibon, who is injured and in great pain somewhere along the forest road. A
priest might suddenly sense that his patriarch is being tortured in the dungeons of
Castle Varrack.
<P></P>
The spell can also be cast by more than one priest, allowing them to either
contact greater numbers of individuals or increase the intensity of the message.
If greater numbers are desired, ten characters are contacted per priest
involved in the casting.
<P></P>
Increasing the intensity of the message makes it more compelling. Doubling the
intensity (requiring at least three priests) causes the message to act as a <I>suggestion</I>. In this case, the effect is limited to a single target. Tripling the
intensity (requiring at least five priests) gives the spell the force of a <I>quest</I>. This effect is also limited to a single target. In both cases, the target is
allowed a saving throw to avoid the effect of the <I>suggestion</I> or <I>quest</I>.
