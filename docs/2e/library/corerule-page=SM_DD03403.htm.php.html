</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Force Mage: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Some of the most powerful spells available to a wizard consist of <I>force</I>—cohesive magical energy that can be shaped into fields, walls, or blades.
Force is energy that simulates solid matter; it is impervious to normal matter and
can be used to exert physical pressure on creatures or objects. A force mage
specializes in spells that conjure and manipulate magical force. Force spells
are difficult and taxing to a wizard, and a character must have an Intelligence
of 12 or better and a minimum Constitution of 15 (Intelligence/Knowledge and
Constitution/Health) to choose this specialty.
<P></P>
Naturally, the school of force includes <I>wall of force </I>and the <I>Bigby’s hand </I>spells. However, spells such as <I>magic missile </I>and <I>Mordenkainen’s sword </I>also make use of magical force. The schools of alteration and divination
oppose the school of force, since these have nothing to do with the summoning or
manipulation of magical energy.
<P></P>
Force mages have the usual advantages and disadvantages of specialist wizards.
(Refer to <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03717.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03717.htm.php.html">Appendix 3</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> for the complete list of spells belonging to this school.) At 8th level,
force mages gain an additional +1 bonus to their saving throws versus force spells
or effects, for a total of +2. When a force mage reaches 11th level, he gains
the ability to attempt a saving throw for half-effect against any force spell
that causes damage, whether or not it allows a save. For example, an 11th-level
force mage struck by a <I>magic missile </I>spell may attempt to save for half damage, despite the fact that <I>magic missile </I>normally allows no saving throw. At 14th level, the force mage’s saving throw
bonus increases to +3 against magical force.
<P></P>
Force mages are skilled in battle; most of their spells are designed to
hinder, incapacitate, or destroy their enemies. However, they do not enjoy a great
variety of spells and must get along without access to two of the most useful
schools available—divination and alteration.
