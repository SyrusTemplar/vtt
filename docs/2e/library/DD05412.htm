?? A character must stay with the same kit for his entire career; he can't
exchange it for a different one. However, he can abandon the kit at any time,
continuing as a <A HREF="PHB_DD01464.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01464.htm">standard paladin</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> described in the <I>PH</I> without any of the benefits or hindrances associated with a particular kit.

?? There are many reasons why a player might want to abandon a kit. Maybe he
feels limited by the kit restrictions (he wants more freedom than is allowed by the
Squire). Or perhaps recent campaign events make the kit less fun to play (the
king wants all his Chevaliers to stay home for the rest of the year to guard
the castle). Whatever the reason, the DM should honor a player's request to
abandon his kit. If the DM wants to work the abandonment into an adventure, the
change may occur gradually. If the change doesn't significantly affect the
campaign's storyline, the change may occur immediately.

?? When a character abandons a kit, he loses all of the kit's bonuses, benefits,
penalties, and hindrances. The nonweapon proficiencies associated with the kit,
including requirements and recommendations, no longer apply. Bonus
proficiencies, however, aren't forfeited. Instead, they are set aside (written down but
not used) until the character acquires new nonweapon proficiency slots. The new
slots must be spent paying for the former bonus proficiencies; the player may
buy these proficiencies in any order. The player must pay for all former bonus
proficiencies before he can choose any new nonweapon proficiencies.
<P></P>
?? Should the character acquire new weapon proficiency slots, they may be spent
on weapon proficiencies of the player's choice. The character may use any
weapons normally available to the paladin.
