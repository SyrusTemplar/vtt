<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Psionicist </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The psionicist character works to mold mind, body, and spirit into a unified,
powerful whole. The hero-s internal energy, or psionic strength, comes from
deep within himself-from a place psionicists call the nexus. This energy is given
form and purpose by the individual-s strength of will. Through extraordinary
discipline, long contemplation, and deepening awareness of self, the psionicist
taps the vast potential of his mind.
<P></P>
Psionicists must meet or exceed the following prerequisites.
<P></P>
<B>Ability requirements:</B> Constitution 11, Intelligence 12, Wisdom 15
<P></P>
<B>Prime requisites:</B> Wisdom, Constitution
<P></P>
<B>Races allowed: </B>Any
<P></P>
Because the pursuit of psionics require strict mental and physical discipline,
a psionicist has two prime requisites: Wisdom and Constitution. His primary
mental ability score is Wisdom. As the measure of his willpower and
enlightenment, Wisdom promotes the understanding and mastery of the inner self-the essence
of psionic ability. Likewise, the tremendous stress of using psionics requires a
healthy body to house a fit mind. This is where Constitution comes into play.
Lastly, Intelligence is important to psionicists because of the reasoning and
memorization necessary to the class.
<P></P>
All races eligible for use as player characters can become psionicists. Human
psionicists have no limit on the levels of experience they can attain in their
chosen class. Half-elves, half-orcs, and half-ogres (due to their partial human
heritage) can reach 12th level. Halflings and gnomes can attain 10th level.
Dwarves and elves can reach only 8th level as psionicists. All creatures not
listed here can reach 10th level.

first class and scores of 17 or more in the prime requisites of the class he

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Psionicists can be of any alignment, save chaotic. The discipline integral to
psionics can-t be maintained by chaotic characters. If a psionicist-s alignment
shifts to chaotic for any reason, he quickly begins to lose psionic powers.
Every day his alignment remains chaotic, the character must make an ability check
against one-half his Wisdom score, rounded down. Each time the character fails
this check, he loses access to one psionic discipline and all the powers
related to it. The discipline is selected randomly by the DM.
<P></P>
Psionicists who change to chaotic alignment can-t recover PSPs. If a
psionicist-s alignment turns from chaotic back to nonchaotic, he begins to recover lost
disciplines at a rate of one per day. This is accomplished by making the same
halved Wisdom check described above-success indicates the return of a random
discipline from those that were lost.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Psionicists disdain using weapons of any sort. Further, they don-t have the
time to properly train in their use. If a psionicist character wants to use a
weapon, he must select it from the following small-sized items: hand crossbow,
dagger, dart, dirk, knife, scourge, sickle, and short sword.
<P></P>
Psionicists can only use the following types of armor: padded, leather,
studded leather, and hide. They may also carry small shields.
<P></P>

listed on the same table, though these characters must refer to their class-s own
THAC0 tables for calculated attack rolls.
<P></P>
Psionicists gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws vs. enchantment/charm spells.
This is in addition to any magical defense adjustments for high Wisdom scores.

<P></P>
At 9th level, a psionicist becomes a contemplative master. Such a master can
build a sanctuary to use as his headquarters and can attract followers. A
1st-level psionicist arrives monthly to study with the master, regardless of whether
he builds a sanctuary. The maximum number of followers is equal to the master-s
Charisma score if he builds a sanctuary, or half that number rounded down if
he doesn-t.
<P></P>
A master-s followers want to learn. They serve in any capacity the master
chooses as long as the master spends at least 10 hours per week instructing them.
If the master doesn-t live up to this schedule, the followers leave to find
someone else.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A psionicist determines his initial PSP total by adding bonuses awarded for
high Wisdom, Constitution, and Intelligence scores to a base of 15, then adding
the result of a 1d6 die roll:
<P></P>
<B>Wis bonus + Con bonus + Int bonus + 15 + 1d6 = 1st-level PSP total.
<P></P>
</B> With every level increase, up to the 9th level, a psionicist gains additional
PSPs by adding the bonuses to a 1d6 die roll:
<P></P>
<B>Wis bonus + Con bonus + Int bonus + 1d6 = PSPs gained per level (2 through 8).
<P></P>
</B> Starting at 9th level, a psionicist gains just 3 PSPs per level, plus his
Wisdom bonus.
<P></P>
<B>Wis bonus + 3 = PSPs gained per level (9th level and higher).

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Every psionic power belongs to one of the five psionic disciplines: <I>clairsentience, psychokinesis, psychometabolism, psychoportation,</I> and <I>telepathy</I>. Powers are either major (and are called <I>sciences</I>) or minor (called <I>devotions</I>). Before a psionicist can learn a psionic power, he must have access to the
appropriate discipline.
<P></P>
At 1st level, a psionicist selects one discipline. This is his <I>primary discipline</I>. As a psionicist advances in level, he gains access to additional disciplines
(as shown on the <A HREF="DD03222.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03222.htm">Psionic Progression table</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. A psionicist starts out at 1st level with four powers within his primary
discipline: one science and three devotions. With each advance in level, the
psionicist gains additional disciplines and powers, as outlined. Some additional
points to consider include the following:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> A player can select new powers for his character as soon as the character
reaches a new experience level. These new powers can be selected from any
discipline the character has access to, including a discipline that was just gained.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Within a single discipline, a character must have twice as many devotions as
sciences. For example, a player can-t select a third telepathic science until
his character has at least six telepathic devotions.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> A character can never learn as many sciences and devotions in another
discipline as he knows in his primary discipline. This provides a focus for a hero that
he can adhere to throughout his career.
