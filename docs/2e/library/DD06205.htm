Many spells require somatic components (gestures or movements). If the wizard
is unable to move his hands (because of damage, a magical effect, or physical
restraint) he may be unable to cast a spell that requires hand movements. If a
spell specifically requires hand movements, the wizard isn't allowed to
substitute another method. He cannot just wiggle his ears or rock his head in place of
the required hand movements, nor can he use a familiar or other character (or
animated object) to act as his surrogate to execute them. If a single finger is
the requirement for a somatic component (for instance, if the wizard needs to
point at the target of his spell), then he needs only one free hand to cast the
spell; otherwise, either hand (or any finger) will suffice.
<P></P>
Note that a movement-impaired wizard also might have difficulty with spells
requiring material components. If the wizard has his hands tied, he may not be
able to reach the necessary material components inside his back pack or mingled
with other items in a deep pocket in his robe. Even if he manages to fish them
out, certain spells may require him to manipulate the material components in a
certain way (he might be required to rub the components together or hold them
flat in his hand; <I>protection from evil</I> requires the caster to trace a three-foot-diameter circle on the ground with
powdered silver). If he cannot manipulate the material components as required,
the spell will not work. When a wizard acquires a new spell, the DM should
clarify its casting procedures.
<P></P>
Remember that the use of components is an optional rule. If components are not
used for spell casting in your campaign, assume that the caster must have both
arms free in order to cast any spell (see the Casting Spells section on <A HREF="PHB_DD01652.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01652.htm">page 85</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> of the <I>PH </I>). Any combination of hand movements and gestures will suffice.
