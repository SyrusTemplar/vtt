<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="1">
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Necromancers and death priests have an awesome arsenal of magical items at
their disposal. In the <I>DMG</I>, all varieties of enchanted daggers (particularly the <I>dagger of venom</I>), <I>darts of homing, swords of wounding, life stealing,</I> and <I>the planes</I> would be ideal weapons for such characters; the <I>axe of hurling</I> is a favorite among high priests of the Murder Goddess. Necromancers would
also collect or manufacture <I>scrolls of protection from poison, possession,</I> and <I>undead, rings of wizardry, staves of the magi</I> or<I> power</I>, <I>wands of illumination, conjuration</I> or <I>paralyzation,</I> <I>amulets of life protection</I> or <I>versus undead,</I> and<I> mirrors of life trapping.</I> Death priests seek similar items (providing they are usable by clerics),
including <I>rods of resurrection,</I> <I>staves of curing, the serpent, swarming insects,</I> and <I>withering,</I> and the <I>phylactery of long years.</I>
<P></P>
The <I>Tome of Magic</I> also contains a number of magical items that are particularly appropriate to
necromancers or death priests: <I>powder of coagulation, the ring of necromantic resistance, bag of bones, claw
of magic stealing, jar of preserving, school caps of necromancy,</I> and the <I>tapestry of disease warding.</I>
<P></P>
Undead Masters, Philosophers, and other necromancers who favor conjuration and
summonings may own or create <I>rings of djinni summoning, efreeti bottles,</I> and other elemental-summoning devices (bowls, censers, stones, and so on).
Many of these items can be modified to work on the evil denizens of the Lower
Planes as well, containing one or more imprisoned fiends who are bound to serve
the owner of the device. Other items that merely summon a fiend from the nether
regions may require some form of sacrifice in order to appease the creature and
secure its willing service for some period of time. Note that elemental or
fiendish prisons will usually be enchanted with protections for the user; summoning
devices, on the other hand, may not be fitted with such amenities and (at the
very least) will require the wise user to be warded in a circle of <I>protection from evil.
<P></P>
</I> Many necromantic items are strongly tied to the practice of the Black Arts
and, as such, are only appropriate for evil characters. These items may still
function if wielded by good PCs, but they usually bring some form of curse on the
user (see Chapter Three). A dagger of venom, for instance, may slip in battle
and strike an ally (or even the user). All of the dangers associated with
criminal necromancy apply to magical items as well as spells. Items created for use by
members of a specific religious cult may simply fail to operate when used by a
member of a different faith.
<P></P>
The DM is the final arbiter in terms of what items are appropriate for PCs in
a particular campaign. He or she must ultimately decide what baneful
side-effects and curses (if any) will befall adventurers who rely upon necromantic
devices far beyond their understanding and formal magical training. For the remainder
of this section, we present a number of new magical items that are appropriate
for necromancers, death priests, and other practitioners of ancient and
forbidden magic (although they may occasionally be used by any unscrupulous sort of
character).
<P></P>
<B>Amulet of Health:</B> These talismans have been enchanted and used since ancient times. Originally,
they were carved in the shape of some strong animal, like a lion or elephant,
and worn about the neck. More recent amulets, created by the Brotherhood of
Sorrow, have been fashioned in the shape of two bound hands, tied at the wrist,
and may be worn or carried anywhere on the body in order to benefit from its
protection.
<P></P>
?-These amulets confer complete immunity to disease and madness (see Chapter
Three). They protect against curses, magical items, monsters, and spells that
inflict plague and insanity. They even ward against lycanthropy, mummy rot, and
other magical diseases. Note that these amulets do not automatically cure any
previous afflictions; they only prevent the owner from contracting such disease
or madness in the future. A few of these amulets (5%) also provide protection
against poison. (1,000 XP.)
<P></P>
<B>Amulet of Terror:</B> These devices were first forged in the distant past by the Necromancer Kings
of Nog and Kadar, and their secrets have only recently been brought to light by
Kazerabet-s <I>Art of Necromancy.</I> When activated, this talisman cloaks the wielder in a purple aura of
malevolence, terrible to behold. Kazerabet has compared the amulet-s necromantic
radiance to the chilling aura of a lich, though it has a decidedly different effect.
Everyone within 30? of the wielder must make a saving throw vs. spells with a
?2 penalty or stand rooted to the spot, frozen in terror, for 2?5 rounds. These
devices have 20?50 charges when discovered. (3,000 XP.)
<P></P>
<B>Arrow of Harm:</B> Similar in appearance to the dreaded <I>arrow of slaying</I>, this black-shafted war arrow is inscribed with fell runes by the powerful
priests of Murder and Pestilence. It confers a +3 bonus to hit when shot by any
variety of long bow. Any living creature stuck by this necromantic bolt suffers
the effect of a harm spell and is automatically reduced to 1d4+1 hit points.
<P></P>
For so long as the bolt remains in the victim-s flesh, the unfortunate is
immune to the effects of magical or natural healing. Removing the embedded arrow
from a victim-s flesh inflicts an additional 1d8+3 points of damage, which
usually results in unconsciousness (or in some campaigns, the victim-s death once he
or she reaches 0 hp). Attempts to magically heal a victim with an embedded <I>arrow of harm</I> will only succeed if <I>dispel magic</I> is cast on the bolt during the same round as a <I>cure light wounds</I> (or similar magic) is employed on the victim.
<P></P>
Its rumored that the Cult of Pain has devised an even nastier version, similar
to the regular arrow, except that the victim is additionally forced to make a
saving throw vs. death magic or be paralyzed with pain for so long as the bolt
remains embedded in the flesh (with the same penalties for extraction as the
normal bolt).
<P></P>
From 1?4 of these baneful sheaf arrows will be found at once, and they lose
their magical abilities after they have been used successfully against a victim
(arrows which have missed their target have a 2 in 6 chance of breaking; if not,
they can be collected for use again). (600 XP each.)
<P></P>
<B>Bone Ring:</B> This plain finger ring is always carved from human bone. Nebt Bhakau-s <I>Book of Shadows</I> hints at a secret method for enchanting these rings, but only the clerical
tome<I> On Coming Forth by Day</I> contains the full details of their construction. A bone ring wards the wearer
from all energy- or Strength-draining attacks from all sources (such as undead
and hostile spells). Each ring has 1?100 charges. Each attempted drain that
the ring absorbs will drain one charge until it finally disintegrates into fine,
dry powder. Unless magical divination (such as identify) is employed, the
wearer will not be aware of how many charges are remaining.
<P></P>
A few, special <I>bone rings</I> (5%) are rumored to protect the wearer by absorbing wizard spells of black
necromancy (see Chapter Four), in addition to warding against spells and undead
attacks that drain Strength or life energy. Both versions cannot be recharged.
(3,500 XP for lesser; 5,000 XP for greater ring.)
<P></P>
<B>Gloom Candle:</B> These ebon tapers are a boon to evil death priests and necromancers alike and
can be enchanted by one of either profession once they reach 12th level,
according to the recipe set forth in the<I> Book of Shadows</I> (wizard version) or<I> On Coming Forth by Day</I> (priest version). A gloom candle burns for an hour, although it can be
normally extinguished prior to that duration.
<P></P>
While it burns, a <I>gloom candle</I> fills a 100? radius with a deep shadow, negating any light or darkness in the
area of effect. A necromancer (or a type of death priest normally unable to
command undead, such as a cleric of Suffering) using the <I>candle</I> gains the ability to control undead as a 6th-level priest. This only affects
any undead within the candle-s radius and for the duration of the <I>candle-s</I> power. Evil priests gain a +2 ability to control undead. Non-evil priests and
paladins suffer a ?4 penalty on their attempts to control or turn undead.
Finally, undead within the area of effect regenerate 1 hp per round while the <I>candle</I> burns, although they do not regenerate if reduced to 0 hit points. From 1?4 <I>gloom candles</I> will be discovered. (100 XP each.)
<P></P>
<B>Hades Hand:</B> Also called <I>Bane-s fist</I> (or often by its more generic title, the <I>dagger of slaying</I>), this wickedly curved <I>dagger +1</I> is enchanted as a receptacle for 2?5 powerful necromantic spells that
normally require physical contact to transmit. Instead, these spells are stored in the
dagger blade and are triggered and delivered to the victim by subsequent,
successful attacks with the weapon.
<P></P>
The release of these stored spells cannot be controlled by the wielder. They
are automatically bestowed on all subsequent victims of the blade (until all of
the stored spells have been exhausted). The Scabrous Society usually imbues
such daggers with <I>cause (fatal) disease, cause blindness, </I>or <I>slay living.</I> It is said that the wizard version of the dagger, employed most often by
necromancers, can store an even greater number of deadly spells (2?8), such as <I>vampiric touch, lich touch,</I> and so on.
<P></P>
Those slain by a <I>Hades hand</I> are forever dead. Regardless of whether or not the death resulted from a
stored spell or physical dagger damage, the victim of such assault can never be
brought back to life by raise dead, reincarnation, or resurrection. Only a full
wish can restore a character who has been slain by a <I>Hades hand</I>. Members of any character class (evil alignment only) may employ one of these
weapons. Like a <I>ring of spell storing</I>, a <I>Hades hand</I> can be -recharged? with any harmful spell of black necromancy by a death
priest or necromancer. (3,500 XP.)
<P></P>
<B>Handglyphs of Power:</B> These ancient weapons, fashioned by the Necromancer Kings, typically took the
form of small circular medallions, perhaps three to four inches in diameter.
Each medallion would be inscribed with battle glyphs on the front side, the
wheel-shaped symbol of the Nog and Kadar adorning the back surface. A small chain
was sometimes attached to <I>handglyphs</I>, so they could be worn as a necklace, or wrapped around the wrist in combat.
The battle runes on the front side were displayed to any enemy in combat as a
command word or phrase was spoken to trigger its power.
<P></P>
<I>Handglyphs</I> were the primary weapons of the Necromancer Kings, enchanted with one type of
offensive magic cast at 12th level of ability, usually <I>fireball, lightning bolt, enervation, cone of cold, disintegrate,</I> or <I>death spell.</I> When discovered in ruins, they will usually contain 1?4 remaining charges.
Typically short-range weapons, they have a range of at most 30 yards.
<P></P>
Kazerabet reveals the secret to recharging these deadly devices in her <I>Art of Necromancy</I>. She also hints at more powerful handglyphs, known as <I>stun-, blind-,</I> or <I>deathglyphs.</I> These presumably contained <I>power words of stunning, blinding,</I> and <I>killing,</I> respectively, but their existence is mere conjecture, and certainly Kazerabet
offers no suggestions to recharging the more powerful variety, even if they do
exist. (1,800 XP.)
<P></P>
<B>Horn of the Exalted Dead:</B> This horn is a necromantic version of the <I>horn of Valhalla, </I>except that it raises up the spirits of dead warriors (rather than summoning
berserkers from Valhalla) to fight for the owner. According to Kazerabet-s <I>Art of Necromancy,</I> the horn may be enchanted by a necromancer or death priest to bind the
spirits of dead warriors into service. The instrument is typically inscribed with the
names of 2?7 individuals whom the owner must call before blowing the horn.
<P></P>
Each of these spirits can be summoned from the netherworld once per week to
serve the owner. Regardless of their level of experience in life, the spirit
warriors now serve in combat as 5th-level fighters, having AC 4 and 30 hp each
(THAC0 16). Each is armed with a sword and spear. As spirits, they are immune to
all weapons of less than +1 enchantment and unaffected by <I>cold, poison, paralyzation, sleep, hold,</I> and <I>charm</I> spells. They can be turned as wraiths.
<P></P>
After they have been summoned, the spirit warriors remain for up to an hour or
until they have been forced to return to the netherworld by being reduced to 0
hp or being subjected to <I>spirit release</I> or <I>dispel evil</I>. In any event, these spirits are not destroyed and can still be called by the
horn after another week has passed.
<P></P>
The <I>horn of the exalted dead</I> can be used by either necromancers, death priests, or common warriors, though
only members of the former two professions may use the necromantic item with
impunity. If the owner is a warrior, upon sounding the horn for the first time,
his or her name will be magically appended to the list on the instrument. After
the warrior dies, his spirit will be bound to the horn, and subsequent owners
will be able to summon that warrior from the netherworld, too. Nothing short of
a <I>wish</I> (or the destruction of the horn) can erase the fighter-s name from the ranks
of the undying on the horn. (4,000 XP).
<P></P>
<B>Nether Scarab:</B> This ancient talisman, whose secret of manufacture has been thankfully lost
to modern priests and necromancers, is a dark and twisted version of the more
beneficial <I>scarab of protection</I>. It has the same ability to absorb life draining attacks of certain undead
(and spells), but it does not confer a saving throw bonus, nor does it allow a
saving throw against spells that do not normally permit one.
<P></P>
Instead, a <I>nether scarab-s</I> most feared power is the ability to store the level-draining attacks it
absorbs. The scarab-s owner may then redirect these charges later as an attack. The
scarab-s owner need only touch a victim, and if the victim fails a saving throw
vs. death magic, the scarab drains a level (or hit die) and bestows any
drained hit points on the owner (these may increase the owner-s hit points beyond the
normal maximum, but these disappear after an hour as per <I>vampiric touch</I>). Only one level may be drained per round. According to Kazerabet-s
scholarship in the <I>Art of Necromancy</I>, these ancient devices usually have 10 charges, but a rare few (5%) have 20
charges. A nether scarab can never be recharged. (5,000 XP.)
<P></P>
<B>Plague Bolts:</B> These light crossbow bolts (or flight arrows) are enchanted by the Plague
Priests to spread plague and misery in their wake. The +2 missiles inflict either
1d4+3 points of damage if a bolt, or 1d6+2 if an arrow, but whoever is struck
must also make a saving throw vs. petrification. A failed save indicates that
the victim has contracted a fatal disease and will die in 1d20 days unless
treated by a <I>cure disease</I> spell cast by a priest of 7th or higher level. Any person exposed to the
infected victim must also make a saving throw vs. petrification each day or also
become infected.
<P></P>
<I>Plague bolts</I> do not lose their potency after being fired, and may be collected for reuse
(unless they have been broken in flight, 2 in 6 chance). These dangerous arrows
may not be handled with impunity unless the character has learned the venom
handling nonweapon proficiency (see Chapter One for more on this). All others must
make a save vs. petrification each time they use a <I>plague bolt</I>, or become infected themselves. From 1?6 flight arrows (50%) or bolts (50%)
will typically be discovered at once. (150 XP each.)
<P></P>
<B>Robes of the Shadow:</B> A favorite magical item among the followers of the Murder Goddess, these
brocaded robes are equivalent to a <I>cloak of protection</I>, varying from +1 to +3 in enchantment. The robe-s primary power, however,
enables its wearer to assume <I>shadow form</I> for up to one turn per level of experience, once per day. This power is
usually activated by a short prayer to our Lady of Despair (this command phrase is
usually sewn somewhere into the garment). These robes are considered to be
semi-divine artifacts in the cult of the Death Mother, and her Stranglers will seek
to regain a lost set of robes regardless of the cost. (1,000 XP per plus.)
<P></P>
<B>Scepter of the Netherworld:</B> This plain ivory baton, enchanted by priests of the Dead, operates exactly
like the most powerful <I>amulet versus undead</I>. Its primary function, which may be used by any character class, enables the
owner to turn undead like a 9th-level priest (this power, available once per
round, draws one charge whether successful or not).
<P></P>
If the owner is a priest with at least minor access to the necromantic sphere,
or a necromancer, the scepter also enables him or her to call upon the spirits
with <I>speak with dead</I> (once per week, two charges) and <I>summon spirits</I> (once per month, two charges). Refer to the listed spells for details about
these powers (the owner is treated as a 9th-level wizard or priest).
<P></P>
When discovered, the <I>scepter</I> usually contains from 20?50 charges. It may be recharged by any priest of 9th
level or higher with major access to the necromantic sphere. (3,000 XP.)
<P></P>
<B>Scroll of Protection from Fiends:</B> These are popular among Philosophers and Undead Masters, who must regularly
traffic with extraplanar creatures. Like all of the other protection scrolls,
they can be used by any character class.
<P></P>
The scroll requires 1 full round to read if it is to protect against all evil
denizens of the Lower Planes, 7 segments if it will ward against greater
fiends, and only 3 segments if defending against lesser fiends. The circle of
protection created by the scroll extends in a 10? radius from the reader. No fiend can
penetrate the circle physically or magically in any way, but the person(s)
located within the protection may launch attacks from inside. The protection moves
with the reader of the scroll. Its effect lasts for 5?20 (5d4) rounds.
<P></P>
As with other protection scrolls, the warding circle cannot be used to force a
fiend into a place from where further retreat is impossible (such as a
corner). There is no way in which the scroll can be used as an offensive weapon.
(2,500 XP.)
<P></P>
<B>Shadowblade:</B> This weapon is a prison or receptacle for an undead shadow, and it derives
certain powers from its unholy occupant. It functions as a <I>blade +1</I> (either a dagger or a type of sword), and in addition to inflicting normal
weapon damage, it also drains 1d4 points of Strength from a victim with each
successful hit.
<P></P>
Anyone drained of all Strength by the weapon becomes a shadow under the
command of the wielder. A <I>shadowblade </I>cannot be -turned? or controlled by a priest, though any shadows created by
the weapon have no such immunity.
<P></P>
A <I>shadowblade </I>distinctly radiates evil and necromancy, both of which can be detected with
elementary divinations. Only evil characters may employ this weapon. Good or
neutral characters wielding the blade may be drained of 1?4 Strength points by its
shadowy inhabitant unless they make a saving throw vs. death magic for <I>each round</I> they use the weapon. (XP 2,000.)
<P></P>
<B>Staff of Skulls:</B> This staff, usable by all classes, animates skeletal or cadaveric remains
with the command word -Arise!? (1 charge). Animated skeletons or zombies are under
the command of the staff wielder (see <I>animate dead</I>). If the staff should change hands, control of the undead goes with it.
Skeletons or corpses need not be complete, but those lacking parts will, of course,
have their actions and mobility impaired. Such animation is permanent, lasting
until the undead have been destroyed.
<P></P>
Twenty-five percent of these staves have secondary functions which can be
triggered by all generalist mages and most specialists, except Enchanters,
Illusionists, or Transmuters. These greater staves can mend broken bones (see <I>bone growth</I>) or reattach severed limbs (see <I>graft flesh</I>) to a wounded and living subject. They can also be used offensively to attack
the bones of the victim (see <I>bone blight</I> or <I>throbbing bones</I> (<I>WH</I>)). Each of these four secondary functions draws one charge and requires a
successful attack roll in combat if the subject is unwilling.
<P></P>
These staves are sometimes topped by a small ivory skull or hewn from the
thighbone of a giant creature. Both versions of these staves can be readily
enchanted (or recharged) by a necromancer of 12th level or higher. (900 XP for lesser;
3,500 XP for greater staff.)
<P></P>
<B>Talisman of Divining:</B> These are some of the only non-deadly and useful handglyphs created by the
ancient Necromancer Kings. They are similar in appearance and operation to the <I>handglyphs of power</I>, detailed previously. The talismans were created for a variety of divination
purposes (choose a power or roll a d6): 1)<I> detect good/evil</I>; 2) <I>detect life</I>; 3 ) <I>locate remains</I>; 4)<I> detect undead</I>; 5) <I>detect poison/disease</I>; 6) <I>detect magic</I>.
<P></P>
These divinations have a range of a 30? radius around the talisman and are
unaffected by the presence of earth, stone, metal, or wood, though they are
completely blocked by any quantity of salt water, alcohol, iodine, or quicksilver.
These rechargeable devices usually contain 1?100 charges when discovered. (5,000
XP.)
