<TITLE>Manual of Dogmatic Methods-- Miscellaneous Magic (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Manual of Dogmatic Methods:</B> This silver-bound book, studded with jewels, appears to be a tome of
considerable value. The book is actually cursed, although this is not immediately
obvious.
<P></P>
The manual has the power to provide advice on any action that its owner might
consider taking. The owner need only open to any page in the book, and there
before him will be a list of actions, most of them ritualistic in nature, to
insure the success of any project he undertakes.
<P></P>
The first time the book is used, the owner is suddenly struck with the idea
that he now owns a source of information that can give him valuable advice on any
matter. It becomes a guide for his whole life. He will not share the book or
let anyone take it away from him. If anyone tries to remove it, he will fight to
keep the book.
<P></P>
Following the first use of the book, the owner cannot do anything without
first checking the book. The information in the manual is completely worthless, but
the owner of the book does not realize this. The pages in the manual change
constantly, offering its owner an obscure (and usually ridiculous) ritual to
perform before doing anything. Thus, if a character is about to go into battle, he
might check the book and find several exercises he should undertake to loosen
his muscles. If he is going to speak to a duke, he might find instructions for
the color of his clothing according to the day of the year and the time of day
of the meeting. If he is going to pray to his god for a spell, he might find six
pages of cleansing rituals that should be performed first.
<P></P>
The manual's instructions are almost never harmful, but they might delay the
owner's actions at a crucial moment.
<P></P>
Whenever a character is in a situation that requires hasty action (for
example, he is attacked), the book will delay its owner by 1d8 rounds. If the owner is
preparing for a lengthy activity (a long trip, for example), he will be busy
for 1d4 days getting ready for the event. The DM should be creative in detailing
the tasks the owner must perform before he can comfortably commit himself to
his goal.
<P></P>
The compulsion to follow the manual's instructions can be ended with a <I>remove curse</I> spell. Following this, the next person to open the book becomes its new
owner. If an owner should die, the book becomes the property of the next person to
open its cover.
<P></P>
If possible, the DM should hint that the character is actually gaining bonuses
for using the book, while allowing the other characters in the group to figure
out the effects for themselves.
