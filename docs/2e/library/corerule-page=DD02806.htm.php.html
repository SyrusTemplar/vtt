This spell can collapse ramparts (or sections of ramparts) up to 240 yards
long and up to 60 feet thick. A rampart collapsed in this manner is treated as
damaged; if less than a third of its original volume remains, it is considered
destroyed (see the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02814.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02814.htm.php.html">Sieges section</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, below). A rampart can be made resistant to <I>move earth </I>spells by facing it with brick or stone or bracing it internally with timbers
or stone. A rampart reinforced in this manner resists a move earth spell on a
roll of 10 or higher on 1d20. If the rampart is faced and internally braced, it
is immune to <I>move earth </I>spells.
