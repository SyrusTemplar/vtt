<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Mouse Cart:</B> A <I>mouse cart</I> resembles a miniature wooden cart with two wooden wheels and a tiny leather
harness. When a normal mouse is secured in the harness, the cart expands to the
size of a normal cart (roughly 5 square feet). The mouse retains its normal
size, but becomes enchanted, acquiring the ability to pull the cart plus 250
pounds of cargo at a movement rate of 12.
<P></P>
As long as the mouse remains in the harness, it is compelled to obey all oral
commands from the person who put him in the harness. The mouse will run
forward, stop, turn, and obey all similar commands; it will not attack or take any
action that a mouse is normally incapable of performing. No other creature
attached to the <I>mouse cart</I> will activate the device's magical properties. A character or other creature <I>polymorphed</I> or otherwise transformed into a mouse can activate the cart's magic.
