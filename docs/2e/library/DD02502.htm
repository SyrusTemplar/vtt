Not to be confused with the two-handed weapon style, two weapon style uses a
weapon in each of the character?s hands. The advantage of this is clear: the
character either has more attack power or can use the secondary weapon defensively
to block incoming blows. Another benefit lies in the fact that even if the
character loses a weapon, he?s still armed.
<P></P>
The character can use any one-handed weapon in his primary hand, but his
secondary weapon must be a size smaller than his primary weapon. Knives and daggers
can always be used, regardless of the primary weapon?s size. The character
suffers a ?2 penalty to attacks with the primary weapon, and a ?4 to attacks with
the secondary weapon. This penalty is offset by the character?s reaction
adjustment for high Dexterity.
<P></P>
<I>Important Note: </I>While the character receives his normal number of attacks for class, level,
and specialization with his primary weapon, he only receives one additional
attack with his secondary weapon.

Warriors and rogues know two weapon fighting style.
