Most of the spells in the Sphere of Chaos give the spellcaster the ability to
add randomness and confusion to the world around him. Some of the spells change
the probability of the outcomes of events, while others offer protection
against Lawful influences.
<P></P>
Many of the spells of this sphere are tricky; while they usually help the
spellcaster, there are times when the spell might harm the priest. Such is the way
of Chaos--anyone who draws upon chaotic energy knows that nothing is certain,
not even the influences of his god.
<P></P>
Powers that operate in this sphere are deities of mischief, trickery, ill
luck, and those gods devoted to the power of the individual.
