<B>   Description:</B> This is the typical paladin described in the <I>Player's Handbook</I>. An embodiment of lawful good, he represents the loftiest standards of
heroism and righteousness. He is a superb rider, a master of mounted combat, and a
fearless fighter. The True Paladin lives to promote his ideals; he seeks to join
others who share his commitment to good.
<P></P>
   <I>Note:</I> Because the True Paladin has few background requirements and special rules,
this kit makes a good choice for players who want to create paladin characters
with a minimum of fuss. The True Paladin can serve as a standard archetype for
virtually any campaign.
<P></P>
 <B>  Requirements: </B>Standard.
<P></P>
<B>   Ministration:</B> Any. To simplify the character creation process, it's recommended that a
lawful good deity serve as patron, and that he has few, if any, formal ties to a
government or organized church. The True Paladin may be an orphan whose abilities
were granted by a benevolent deity. Alternately, he may be of humble origin,
trained by a Mentor who later died or disappeared.
<P></P>
<B>   Role:</B> The True Paladin is pious and forthright, sworn to uphold a just code of
behavior and determined to rid the world of evil. He serves as the conscience of
his party, setting an example of high moral standards and nudging them back on
track when they stray from their mission. He respects all lawful good authorities
and defers to the elders of his faith.
