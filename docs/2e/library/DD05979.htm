This expensive item allows a thief to make duplicates of keys he holds in his
possession or from impressions of keys made using a wax pad (available as a
separate item; see below). The keymaking set is a number of molds, files, small
blades, metal-working instruments and the like. It also uses a small oil-burning
apparatus for softening and molding metal, so its use is usually restricted to
a safe, secure lair where the thief will not be disturbed. Duplicating a key
takes 1d4 hours, depending on the size and intricacy of the original. A skeleton
key (see below) cannot be duplicated with a keymaking set.
<P></P>
The keymaking set permits the manufacture of poor-to fair-quality soft-metal
replicas of keys, which are rough in appearance and do not resemble the work of
a professional. the duplicate key will open the same locks as the original if
the thief makes a successful Dexterity test (the DM should roll this in
secret). If the thief made his duplicate from a wax pad impression, there is a penalty
of +2 to this dice roll. The thief always thinks his duplicate is a successful
piece of workmanship, of course. Only when it is actually tried on the
appropriate lock(s) will the thief find out for sure.
<P></P>
The keymaking set does not preempt the role of locksmiths or their skill.
Professional locksmiths will duplicate keys with a 99% chance of success and have
superior tools to the keymaking set described here. Each locksmith's set of
tools are individually crafted and modified to suit the locksmith and are too
complex for thieves who are not themselves locksmiths to employ.
