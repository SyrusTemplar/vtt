<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Beggars</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Beggars earn a living off the generosity of others. They are a raggedy lot
who make others pity them or who deceive others into giving them money. A beggar
might dress in rags and huddle on a street corner, calling out to strangers
for coppers so he can buy food. Perhaps he pretends to be maimed, old, or senile,
and begs coins from those more fortunate. Some beggars might actually be down
on their luck and in need of a generous handout. But most of them are capable
of working. A few have begging perfected to a fine art. These are swindlers who
create elaborate schemes to separate the wealthy from their money. Swindlers
might coerce businessmen to invest in a nonexistent company, con lords and ladies
into betting on imaginary horse races, and romance people into marriages that
leaves the marks copperless and abandoned. Beggars adventure to get out of town
if city guards are giving them too much trouble or if they want to score
treasure

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Requirements:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Beggars must be chaotic in alignment and have a Charisma/Leadership score of

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Beggars prefer small weapons that can be concealed. That way they look
defenseless. These weapons include daggers, knives, saps, and slings. However, when
adventuring they use any weapons allowed their character class.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended nonweapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Disguise, forgery, gaming, ventriloquism, seamstress/tailor.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Equipment:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> While begging, these characters dress in rags or whatever other clothing is
appropriate to their scam. However, when adventuring they don the best armor and
weapons they own.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended traits: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Glibness, impersonation, inherent immunity to cold, inherent immunity to heat.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Benefits:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Beggars receive one free nonweapon proficiency at the time of character
creation—if the proficiency comes from the above recommended list.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hindrances:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> These characters are not accepted into upper middle class and upper class
social circles—at least in the community in which the beggar is plying his trade.
This equates to a –4 reaction roll penalty if the beggar is trying to socialize
with the upper crust.
