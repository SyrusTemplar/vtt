<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Glass of Preserved Words: </B>This magical magnifying glass has a band of silver around the lens and an
ivory handle. The glass has the ability to make illegible written words readable.
Words that were carved into stone but worn away through time, inked letters
blurred due to moisture, messages clouded by magic, and magical and normal writings
all become clear when read through the glass.
<P></P>
The actual words remain illegible; they are not altered in any way. Only a
character looking at them through the glass can read them clearly.
<P></P>
The glass does not protect the reader from any harmful effects as a result of
a cursed scroll or trapped writings, nor does it make cryptically worded or
coded messages understandable.
