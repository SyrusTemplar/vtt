When using this system, the first thing to do is to calculate your character's
&quot;Numbed&quot; and &quot;Useless&quot; Numbers.
<P></P>
Calculate 25% (one-fourth) of your character's hit point total (don't count
current injuries; this is his starting hit point total). Round up if the
fraction is .5 or higher. On your character sheet, near the hit point listing, write
down &quot;Numbed&quot; and that number. (You can also use the Combat Sheet included at
the end of this book.) If the result was 0, write down 1 instead.
<P></P>
Then, calculate 50% (one-half) of your character's hit point total. Round up
if the fraction is .5 or higher. On your character sheet, also near the hit
point listing (or on this chapter's Combat Sheet), write down &quot;Useless&quot; and that
number. If the result was 1, write down 2 instead.
<P></P>
Whenever you go up a level and gain new hit points, recalculate those numbers.
<P></P>
<I>Example: Zaross has 27 hit points. His Numbed number is 6.75 (rounds up to 7),
and his Useless number is 13.5 (rounds up to 14).
