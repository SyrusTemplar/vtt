<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Whether a character chooses to be a mage or a specialist in one of the schools
of magic, he must learn his spells from somewhere. While it might be possible
for the exceptional wizard to learn the secrets of arcane lore entirely on his
own, it isn't very likely. It is far more likely that your character was
apprenticed to another wizard as a lad. This kindly (severe), loving (callous),
understanding (ill-tempered), generous (mean-spirited), and upright (untrustworthy)
master taught your character everything he knows at the start of the game.
Then, when it was time, the master sent him into the world (threw him out) with a
smile and a pat on the back (snarling with his foot on your character's behind).
<P></P>
Or perhaps your character studied at a proper academy for wizards (if your DM
has such things). There he completed his lessons under the eye of a firm (mean)
but patient (irritable) tutor who was ready with praise for good work (a cane
for the slightest fault). But alas, your character's parents were impoverished
and his studies had to end (fed up with this treatment, your youthful character
fled during the night).
<P></P>
As you can see, there are a number of ways your character might have learned
his spells.
<P></P>
The one good thing that comes from your character's studies is his initial
spell book. It may have been a gift from his school or he may have stolen it from
his hated master. Whatever the case, your character begins play with a spell
book containing up to a few 1st-level spells. Your DM will tell you the exact
number of spells and which spells they are. As your character adventures, he will
have the opportunity to add more spells to his collection.
<P></P>
When your character attains a new level, he may or may not receive new spells.
This is up to your DM. He may allow your character to return to his mentor
(provided he departed on good terms!) and add a few spells to his book. It may be
possible for your character to copy spells from the spell book of another
player character (with his permission, of course). Or he may have to wait until he
can find a spell book with new spells. How he gets his spells is one of the
things your DM decides.
<P></P>
In al cases, before he can add a new spell to his spell book, you have to
check to see if your character learns that spell. The chance of learning a spell
depends on your wizard's Intelligence, as given in <A HREF="DD01432.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01432.htm">Table 4</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. This chance may be raised or lowered if your character is a specialist.
