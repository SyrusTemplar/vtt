<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sovereign Glue:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This pale amber substance is thick and viscous. Because of its particular
powers, it can be contained only within a flask coated with <I>oil of slipperiness,</I> and each time any of the bonding agent is poured from the flask, a new
application of the <I>oil of slipperiness</I> must be put on the flask within one round to prevent the remaining glue from
adhering to the side of the container.
<P></P>
One ounce of the adhesive will cover approximately one square foot of surface,
bonding virtually any two substances together in a permanent union. The glue
takes one full round to set; if the objects are pulled apart before that time
has elapsed, that application of the glue will lose its stickiness and be
worthless. If the glue is allowed to set, then attempting to separate the two bonded
objects will only result in the rending of one or the other except when <I>oil of etherealness</I> or <I>universal solvent</I> is applied to the bondâ€”<I>sovereign glue</I> is dissolved only by those liquids. A typical container of the substance
holds 1d10 ounces of glue.
