crests and symbols that denote different persons and groups. Heraldry comes in many
forms and is used for many different purposes. It can be used to identify
noblemen, families, guilds, sects, legions, political factions, and castes. The
symbols may appear on flags, shields, helmets, badges, embroidery, standards,
clothing, coins, and more. The symbols used may include geometric patterns,
calligraphed lines of script, fantastic beasts, religious symbols, and magical seals
(made for the express purpose of identification). Heraldry can vary from the
highly formalized rules and regulations of late medieval Europe to the knowledge
of different shield patterns and shapes used by African tribesmen.

The character automatically knows the different heraldic symbols of his
homeland and whom they are associated with. In addition, if the character makes a
successful proficiency check, he can correctly identify the signs and symbols of
other lands, provided he has at least a passing knowledge of the inhabitants of
that land. His heraldry skill is of little use upon first entering a foreign
land.
