A strong hook is set into the end of the pole, which has several uses. The
first is to yank discovered trip wires, if this is what the thief wishes to do,
although a blade pole is usually superior for dealing with such problems. The
more common use, though, is to use the hook to catch on objects so they can be
retrieved. Depending on the size of the hook, anything from a key ring or small
jewelry casket (hooked through the catch) to a rich man's joint of beef can be
purloined by the thief. At the DM's option, a skill check (a pick pockets roll)
may be required for success. In medieval England, fishing through windows with
hooked poles was so common that a subclass of thief who made a living in this
way was commonly known and called &quot;the hooker.&quot;
