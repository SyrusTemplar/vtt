This spell enables the caster to make a snare that is 90% undetectable without
magical aid. The snare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope.
When the <I>snare</I> spell is cast upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings. One
end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the
limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle (note that the head of a worm or
snake could be thus ensnared).
<P></P>
If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The
magic of the spell causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is
triggered, inflicting 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped, and lifting
it off the ground by the trapped member(s) (or strangling it if the head/neck
triggered the snare). If no such sapling or tree is available, the cordlike
object tightens upon the member(s), then wraps around the entire creature, causing
no damage, but tightly binding it. Under water, the cord coils back upon its
anchor point. The snare is magical, so for one hour it is breakable only by cloud
giant or greater Strength (23); each hour thereafter, the snare material loses
magic so as to become 1 point more breakable per hour--22 after two hours, 21
after three, 20 after four--until six full hours have elapsed. At that time, 18
Strength will break the bonds. After 12 hours have elapsed, the materials of
the snare lose all magical properties and the loop opens, freeing anything it
held. The snare can be cut with any magical weapon, or with any edged weapon
wielded with at least a +2 attack bonus (from Strength, for example).
<P></P>
The caster must have a snake skin and a piece of sinew from a strong animal to
weave into the cordlike object from which he will make the snare. Only the
caster's holy symbol is otherwise needed.
