Halfling settlements for the most part tend to remain small--they will live in
towns and shires scattered throughout a human empire, for example, or they
might occupy several small villages in a forest ruled by an elven king. In a few
cases, halfling holdings have expanded to the size of a kingdom--both the
Forgotten Realms and Krynn boast nations populated and ruled entirely by halflings.
But even here, they have labored to maintain peaceable relations with the realms
that share their borders.
