A mantlet is something like an oversized shield. It is typically made of heavy
planks and is six feet high and 10 feet wide. A single figure armed with a bow
or crossbow can fire through an opening in the mantlet and claim 90% cover.
Additional figures firing from behind the mantlet can claim 50% cover.

A mantlet weighs 100 pounds and requires at least two Man-sized creatures to
carry it. Creatures carrying a mantlet move as though heavily encumbered (due to
the mantlet-s bulk) even if they can handle the weight. Mantlets usually are
fitted with props so the troops carrying it can set it down and use it without
being encumbered.

An abatis is similar to a mantlet, but lower and thicker. It is used to plug
breeches in walls and to provide a semi-mobile barrier against foes. An abatis
provides 50% cover to creatures behind it. Large-sized and smaller creatures
cannot cross an abatis until it is destroyed. Giants and other Huge, bipedal
creatures can cross an abatis at a cost of two movement points.
