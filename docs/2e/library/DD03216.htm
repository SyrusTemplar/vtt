<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Psionic powers have definite limitations. Some of these already have been
discussed, but are repeated here to emphasize them. Other limitations are new.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> <B>PSPs:</B> Psionicists and wild talents have a finite amount of psionic strength
available to them at any given time. This strength, expressed as PSPs, must be
expended to use psionic attacks, defenses, and powers. The total also indicates how
much damage a hero's psionic defenses can withstand before his mind opens. As
such, the psionic character must always balance the use of powers, attacks, and
defenses with how strong he wants his own internal walls to remain.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> <B>Line of Sight:</B> All psionic attacks and most powers require line of sight to use. If line of
sight is blocked, most psionics won-t work.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> <B>Touch: </B>Some psionic powers have a range of -touch.- These can be used in melee
combat, but they require a physical attack roll <I>and</I> an MTHAC0 roll to work. Like all psionic powers, they only can be used
against open minds.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> <B>Obstructions: </B>Anything that hinders a character's normal vision blocks line of sight. Unless
the description states otherwise, psionicists require a line of sight to use a
power. Obvious exceptions to this rule are the clairsentient powers and many
of the telepathic powers. However, certain materials can obstruct these psionic
powers if they completely block the target. These are lead and iron (at least 1
inch thick), obsidian (at least 2 inches thick), stone (at least 1 foot
thick), and the <I>antimagic shell</I> spell.
