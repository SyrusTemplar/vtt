This spell changes one object or creature into another. When used as a <I>polymorph other</I> or <I>stone to flesh</I> spell, simply treat the spell as a more powerful version, with saving throws
made with -4 penalties to the die roll. When it is cast in order to change
other objects, the duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made
from the original state to its enchanted state, as well as how different it is in
size. The DM determines the changes by using the following guidelines:

A change in <I>kingdom</I> makes the spell work for hours (if removed by one kingdom) or turns (if
removed by two). Other changes likewise affect spell duration. Thus, changing a lion
to an androsphinx would be permanent, but turning a turnip to a purple worm
would be a change with a duration measured in hours. Turning a tusk into an
elephant would be permanent, but turning a twig into a sword would be a change with
a duration of several turns.
<P></P>
All polymorphed objects radiate a strong magic, and if a <I>dispel magic</I> spell is successfully cast upon them, they return to their natural form. Note
that a <I>stone to flesh</I> spell or its reverse will affect objects under this spell. As with other
polymorph spells, damage sustained in the new form can result in the injury or
death of the polymorphed creature.
<P></P>
For example, it is possible to polymorph a creature into rock and grind it to
dust, causing damage, perhaps even death. If the creature was changed to dust
to start with, more creative methods to damage it would be needed; perhaps the
wizard could use a <I>gust of wind</I> spell to scatter the dust far and wide. In general, damage occurs when the
new form is altered through physical force, although the DM will have to
adjudicate many of these situations.
<P></P>
The system shock roll must be applied to living creatures, as must the
restrictions noted regarding the <I>polymorph other</I> and <I>stone to flesh</I> spells. Also note that a polymorph effect often detracts from an item's or
creature's powers, but does not add new powers, except possibly movement
capabilities not present in the old form. Thus, a <I>vorpal sword</I> polymorphed into a dagger would not retain vorpal capability. Likewise,
valueless items cannot be made into permanent valuable items.
<P></P>
The material components of this spell are mercury, gum arabic, and smoke.
