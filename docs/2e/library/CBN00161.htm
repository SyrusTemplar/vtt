This spire lies on the eastern shores of Sahu, as described in the Tales of
Captain Omar (see the introduction to Chapters 7 and 8, and the NPC sheet for
Pizentios). The mushroom-shaped metal tower, similar to the spires of Ereshkigal,
cannot be seen from shore, but there is a small collection of wooden buildings
in a sheltered lagoon that serves as a supply base for a pirate ship of
necromancers, the <I>Scrofula</I> (see the NPC sheet for Sarzec).
<P></P>
Normally well-camouflaged by palm trees, the wooden supply sheds might have
been temporarily uncovered in a recent storm, making them visible from a ship at
sea. Otherwise, a party might stumble across the lagoon by chance, with or
without the <I>Scrofula</I> at port.
<P></P>
The supply sheds are guarded by a squad of twelve zombies (maximum hit
points). The zombies will not attack if the party leaves the supply sheds alone. If
the undead are defeated, the storerooms will be found to contain spare sails,
spars, rigging, and planking—everything one might need to equip a ship, except
food and water.
<P></P>
The palm groves near the sheds are the home to four newly made shadows, recent
victims of Pizentios’s <I>shadowblade</I>. These creatures only emerge from the grove at night. Of course, any sounds
of battle at the lagoon or supply sheds will undoubtedly attract Pizentios, who
will appear with his infernal familiar Ifrit to exact vengeance (and perhaps
gain more zombies).
<P></P>
If the party leaves the sheds alone and explores inland, they are quickly
spotted by the invisible Ifrit, who warns his master of their approach. The evil
necromancer will attempt to dupe the party using the same ruse he employed on
Captain Omar, but he will have telepathically summoned his zombies and shadows
just in case the stratagem fails. He has learned from his past mistakes and is
determined not to let history repeat itself.
<P></P>
The DM should place only a moderate amount of treasure in Pizentios’s tower,
since Omar’s raid already stole most of the finer pieces in the necromancer’s
hoard. Should the party manage to defeat Pizentios, he will attempt to flee
through a massive bronze door in the basement, leading to the Underdark beneath Sahu
and, eventually, to the Garden of Eternity. The DM might allow a resourceful
party to follow him there, only to be driven back by the Bone Legion after the
PCs have briefly glimpsed the Garden.
