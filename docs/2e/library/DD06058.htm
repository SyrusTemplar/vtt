This storyline is best combined with one of the others. It fits well in the
thief subculture and can be wrapped around any significant non-player character
in the campaign. It provides PCs with strong motivation and can dramatically
shake up a campaign that starts to run too smoothly.
<P></P>
The NPC who betrays them should be an important figure in the campaign, and
one who is fairly well known to the player characters. He can be their employer,
or a respected neighbor, or even a mentor or family member to one of the PCs.
Ideally, in one of the latter cases, the NPC has a deep and compelling
motivation for the betrayal. Most characters, even including thieves, would not be too
likely to sell their brother or grandmother down the road for a small profit.
<P></P>
The betrayal should be set up carefully by the DM. Perhaps one or two clues
might indicate the NPC's true nature, but only if the players are exceptionally
alert. The betrayal itself should not be the end of the story, however; the PCs
should have a long and difficult road to follow in their quest for an
accounting.
<P></P>
The betrayal situation works best in campaigns where there are many
well-detailed NPCs. If it is used capriciously in a setting with few NPCs, players may
become inclined to distrust <I>every</I> NPC introduced to the game. This is frustrating for players and DM alike.
