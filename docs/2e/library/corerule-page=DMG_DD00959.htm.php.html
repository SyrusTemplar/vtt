<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Harp of Charming:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This instrument appears identical to all other magical harps. When played by a
person proficient in the instrument, the player is able to cast one <I>suggestion</I> spell each turn of playing. Optionally, the DM can require a successful
proficiency check be made to cast the <I>suggestion.</I> On a die roll of 20, the harpist has played so poorly as to enrage all those
who hear.
