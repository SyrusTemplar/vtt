<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Although all wizard spells are learned and memorized the same way, they fall
into nine different schools of magic. A school of magic is a group of related
spells.
<P></P>
<I>Abjuration</I> spells are a group of specialized protective spells. Each is used to prevent
or banish some magical or nonmagical effect or creature. They are often used to
provide safety in times of great danger or when attempting some other
particularly dangerous spell.
<P></P>
<I>Alteration</I> spells cause a change in the properties of some already existing thing,
creature, or condition. This is accomplished by magical energy channeled through the
wizard.
<P></P>
<I>Conjuration/summoning</I> spells bring something to the caster from elsewhere. Conjuration normally
produces matter or items from some other place. Summoning enables the caster to
compel living creatures and powers to appear in his presence or to channel
extraplanar energies through himself.
<P></P>
<I>Enchantment/charm</I> spells cause a change in the quality of an item or the attitude of a person
or creature. Enchantments can bestow magical properties on ordinary items, while
charms can unduly influence the behavior of beings.
<P></P>
<I>Greater divinations</I> are more powerful than lesser divinations (see below). These spells enable
the wizard to learn secrets long forgotten, to predict the future, and to uncover
things hidden or cloaked by spells.
<P></P>
<I>Illusions</I> deal with spells to deceive the senses or minds of others. Spells that cause
people to see things that are not there, hear noises not made, or remember
things that never happened are all illusions.
<P></P>
<I>Invocation/Evocation</I> spells channel magical energy to create specific effects and materials.
Invocation normally relies on the intervention of some higher agency (to whom the
spell is addressed), while evocation enables the caster to directly shape the
energy.
<P></P>
<I>Lesser divination</I> spells are learnable by all wizards, regardless of their affiliation. This
school includes the most basic and vital spells of the wizard--those he needs to
practice other aspects of his craft. Lesser divinations include <I>read magic</I> and <I>detect magic.</I>
<P></P>
<I>Necromancy</I> is one of the most restrictive of all spell schools. It deals with dead
things or the restoration of life, limbs, or vitality to living creatures. Although
a small school, its spells tend to be powerful. Given the risks of the
adventuring world, necromantic spells are considered quite useful.
