mystical significance. The tools of the geometer's trade range from runes drawn
on paper or carved in stone to free-floating constructs of energy woven by the
somatic gestures of a spell. Naturally, geometers excel in the casting of any
spell that involves the drawing of a rune, mark, or diagram. In order to choose
this specialty, a wizard must have an Intelligence (Intelligence/Reason) of 15
or better and a Wisdom (Wisdom/Intuition) of 14 or higher. The spells used by
the school of geometry are described in <A HREF="DD03717.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03717.htm">Appendix 3</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> of this book.

Geometers gain the usual advantages for specialization, but like the
alchemist, they gain no modifiers to their saving throws and inflict no saving throw
penalties on their targets. Beginning at 4th level, a geometer may create scrolls
by committing a spell he knows to paper. He can cast the spell from the scroll
at some later time simply by reading the scroll, which requires one full round;
once read, the scroll is consumed and the spell expended. The geometer may not
have more than one spell-scroll per character level prepared at any given
time, so a 6th-level geometer may have as many as six scrolls ready.

Transcribing a spell to a scroll requires one full day per spell level; a
5th-level spell requires five days of uninterrupted work. The materials cost 100 gp
per spell level, and the wizard needs a suitable laboratory or library to work
in. Only spells of the school of geometry can be transcribed to scrolls, but a
geometer can engage in spell research to find a diagram for spells outside the
school of geometry. In any event, a geometer must succeed in a learn spells
check to see if he is successful in scribing the scroll.
<P></P>
Geometers may also attempt to create various forms of <I>protection </I>scrolls, beginning at 7th level. The geometer must first research the scroll-s
diagram through normal spell research. To figure out how much time and money
should be spent on researching a particular <I>protection</I> scroll, take a look at its experience point value. Basically, a scroll-s
effective spell level is determined by dividing the experience point value by 500
and then adding 2 (i.e., Level = XP/500 + 2) For example, if a scroll is worth
500 XP, it is considered a 3rd-level spell (500 divided by 500 equals 1; 1 plus
2 equals 3). The research time is two weeks per effective level, at a cost of
1,000 gp per level; the geometer must pass a learn spells check to successfully
research the diagram. Once the geometer knows the diagram, he can produce one
scroll by investing in 3d6 x 100 gp worth of materials and spending one
uninterrupted week working in his laboratory. Again, a learn spells check applies to
see if he executed the diagram correctly.

Bordun's rival Teriaz also wishes to pilfer the dragon's hoard, but he-s
decided to provide his agent with a scroll of </I>protection from dragon breath<I>. This is worth 2,000 XP, so it's the equivalent of a 6th-level spell. It will
take Teriaz twelve weeks to research the scroll and costs him 6,000 gold
pieces. After passing his initial learn spells check and succeeding in his research,
Teriaz can produce the scroll with one week of work and an additional 600 gp
(the DM's roll of 3d6 x 100 gp) if he succeeds in the final learn spells check.
While the dragon's hoard has suffered at the hands of the alchemist-s
accomplice, Teriaz's champion succeeds in slaying the beast and claiming the rest of the
hoard.

The geometer's spells tend to be defensive in nature, since many spells in the
school involve drawing or scribing boundaries of some kind. Spells of the
school of geometry are considered to have no verbal component. The school of
geometry is opposed by the schools of enchantment/charm and illusion.
