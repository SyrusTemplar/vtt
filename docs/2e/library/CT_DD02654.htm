Some characters are unnaturally alert and instinctively note signs of trouble
that other characters may miss. A character with this proficiency reduces his
chance of being surprised by 1 in 10 if he makes a successful proficiency check.
In situations where surprise is automatic, the character may still attempt a
proficiency check. If he passes, he is surprised at the normal chance instead of
automatically.
