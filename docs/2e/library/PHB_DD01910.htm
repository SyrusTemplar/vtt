This spell enables the wizard to write instructions or other information on
parchment, paper, etc. The illusionary script appears to be some form of foreign
or magical writing. Only the person (or people) who the wizard desires to read
the writing can do so. An illusionist recognizes it for illusionary script.
<P></P>
Unauthorized creatures glancing at the script must roll saving throws vs.
spell. A successful save means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of
disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a suggestion
implanted in the script by the caster at the time the <I>illusionary script</I> spell was cast. The suggestion cannot require more than three turns to carry
out. The suggestion could be to close the book and leave, or to forget the
existence of the book, for example. A successful <I>dispel magic</I> spell will remove the illusionary script, but an unsuccessful attempt erases
all of the writing. The hidden writings can be read by a combination of the <I>true seeing</I> spell and either the <I>read magic</I> or <I>comprehend languages</I> spell, as applicable.
<P></P>
The material component is a lead-based ink that requires special manufacture
by an alchemist, at a cost of not less than 300 gp per usage.
