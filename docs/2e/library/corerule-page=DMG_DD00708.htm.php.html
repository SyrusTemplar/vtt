<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Delusion:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This potion affects the mind of the character so that he believes the liquid
is some other potion (<I>healing,</I> for example, is a good choiceâ€”damage is &quot;restored'' by drinking it, and only
death or rest after an adventure will reveal that the potion only caused the
imbiber to believe that he was aided). If several individuals taste this potion,
it is 90% probable that they will all agree it is the same potion (or whatever
type the DM announces or hints at).
