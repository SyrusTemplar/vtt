in, satyrs are personifications of nature, embodiments of all that is wild and
carefree. Satyrs have the head, torso, and arms of a human, with the hind legs of
a goat. Two sharp black horns jut through the coarse, curly hair on top of the
head. They love to spend their days and nights in sport, and they never miss
an opportunity to chase after wood nymphs or other comely creatures.

Satyrs are an inoffensive race?they just want to have fun. And when one takes
up the life of an adventurer, he?s usually looking for entertainment. They
don?t understand seriousness or violence, and while they can fight with the best,
they?re more likely to view a battle as just another kind of contest or game.
Satyrs are very impulsive, and are generally unreliable companions despite their
good intentions.
