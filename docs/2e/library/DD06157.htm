Frequently, the local wizard is one of the most learned men in his geographic
area. If he has earned the trust of the citizenry, he may be asked to serve as
a government administrator. Wizards are more likely to be administrators of
small villages than large cities, since the needs of a small village are not
likely to be as demanding, leaving the wizard plenty of free time to pursue his
research.
