This spell enchants a log, plank, or similar piece of wood to become a
temporary steed. The log or plank must be at least one foot wide, three inches thick,
and three to ten feet long. Any type of wood is suitable.
<P></P>
When the spell is cast, the log sprouts four wooden, horselike legs. The <I>tree steed</I> may be ridden like a normal horse and may be used to carry equipment. The <I>tree steed</I> can carry up to 600 pounds of riders and gear before breaking. If the <I>tree steed</I> breaks under the weight of the riders or gear, the enchantment instantly ends
and the <I>tree steed</I> again becomes a normal (although broken) log or plank.
<P></P>
The <I>tree steed</I> obeys all of the caster's verbal commands to move, slow, speed up, stop, and
turn. It has a movement rate of 12 on land. It can move in the water (Sw 6),
floating on the surface and paddling with its legs. The <I>tree steed</I> must remain within 10 yards of the caster in order to move; if the distance
between the <I>tree steed</I> and the caster exceeds 10 yards, the <I>tree steed</I> stops until the caster is again within range.
<P></P>
The <I>tree steed</I> will not fight for the caster and is incapable of any action other than
movement. The <I>tree steed</I> does not become fatigued and does not eat. It has all the vulnerabilities of
normal wood, including fire, and can be damaged by both magical and physical
attacks. It has AC 8 and 20 hit points.
<P></P>
The material components are a log or plank of suitable size and a horseshoe.
