<B>Dig</B>
<P></P>
This is a very helpful spell when dealing with large, uncontrollable fires
that are spreading in a field or other open area. To stop the advance of a
spreading fire, <I>dig</I> can be used to create a firebreak--a ditch of broken soil devoid of
combustible material. A fire reaching a firebreak will stop advancing, eventually
burning itself out. If the fire is too large to stop, the wizard can protect himself
and his companions by using <I>dig</I> to surround themselves with a firebreak and remain inside it while the fire
rages around them. The wizard must take care to make the firebreak large enough
to protect himself and his companions from heat damage, which typically affects
those within 5 feet of the flames.

<B>Fumble</B>
<P></P>
This spell can cause a lot of grief to opponents in precarious positions. <I>Fumble</I> cast on a character clinging to the side of a cliff might cause him to fall.
If cast on a character moving hand over hand across a rope bridge, the
character might lose his grip and fall. If such a character fails his saving throw, he
plunges from the cliff or releases the rope. If he succeeds in his saving
throw, he hesitates, but doesn't fall.

<B>Otiluke's Resilient Sphere</B>
<P></P>
The <I>sphere</I> is an intact bubble filled with air. Therefore, a creature or object enclosed
in the sphere will bob like a cork on the surface of an ocean or other body of
water. If the <I>sphere</I> contains more weight than air, the <I>sphere</I> will gradually sink, but it could be pushed or carried by water-breathing
creatures with sufficient strength. If a water-breathing character wants to
explore a dark, underwater cavern, the <I>sphere</I> could be cast around a burning fire. The protected fire could then be carried
underwater and would continue to burn until the air supply in the <I>sphere</I> was exhausted. (The carrier should take precautions to prevent being
burned--in most cases, heavy gloves would probably do the trick).
