The victim of <I>compulsive order</I> is compelled to place everything he encounters into perfect order. If he
discovers treasure, he divides it into tidy piles or containers of silver, gold,
and copper. He is reluctant to enter a dungeon because it is a messy place, but
once inside, he is obsessed with cleaning it. A character under the power of
this spell will sweep dirt from dungeon corridors into neat piles, arrange the
corpses of a defeated orc band according to size, dash forward to remove a bit of
lint on clothing, and insist that the party organize themselves alphabetically,
then by size, and then by age. While the spell does not affect a character's
abilities, the overwhelming desire for order impairs the character's usefulness
in most adventures.
<P></P>
When a character afflicted by this spell attempts to undertake a new event
(begin a battle, haggle with the merchant, etc.), the player must rationalize the
action on the basis of his compulsion for order. Thus, the character cannot
simply attack a goblin; he must announce a condition such as attacking the tallest
goblin and fighting his way down according to size. Once stated, the character
must follow through with this plan.
<P></P>
If the player cannot conceive a rationale for his character's behavior, the
character is forced to delay his actions for 1d6 rounds, with the time spent in
preparation for the subsequent action. The character spends time arranging spell
components artistically, deciding how to hold his sword, cleaning his weapon,
etc.
<P></P>
Anyone affected by <I>compulsive order</I> may become violent if he is prevented from being neat. He will do what he
must to make the world around him more orderly. If he is allowed to organize his
surroundings, he will quickly calm down again. The victim will constantly
petition the people around him to be neat and organized.
<P></P>
The victim is allowed a saving throw to avoid the effects of the spell. <I>Compulsive order</I> can be removed with a <I>dispel magic</I> spell.
<P></P>
The material component is a perfect cube made of metal.
