Unlike standard missiles, which target a specific creature, a grenade-like
missile is aimed at a point, whether this point is a creature or a spot on the
ground. When the attack is announced, the player indicates where he wants the
missile to land. This then becomes the target point and is used to determine the
direction and distance of any scatter.
<P></P>
Most grenade-like missiles are items of opportunity or necessity, such as
flasks of oil, vials of holy water, or beakers of acid. As such, these items are
not listed on the equipment tables for range, ROF, and damage. The range each can
be thrown varies with the Strength of the character and the weight of the
object.
<P></P>
A missile of five pounds or less can be thrown about 30 feet. Short range is
10 feet, medium range is 20 feet, and everything beyond is maximum range.
Heavier items have reduced ranges. Just how far an object can be thrown is decided by
the DM.
<P></P>
Exceptionally heavy items can be thrown only if the character rolls a
successful bend bars/lift gates check. In no case can a character throw an item heavier
than his Strength would allow him to lift. Thus, the DM can rule that a
character would have little trouble chucking a half-empty backpack across a 10-foot
chasm, but the character would need to make a check to heave an orc 10 feet
through the air into the faces of his fiendish friends.
<P></P>
Once a container hits, it normally breaks immediately. However, this is not
always true. Some missiles, like soft leather flasks or hard pottery, are
particularly resistant. If there's some doubt about whether a thrown object will
break, the DM can require an item saving throw to see if it shatters or rips,
spewing its contents everywhere.
<P></P>
If a missile is off-target, it is important to know where it landed--an errant
grenade-like missile could present a hazard to other characters, start a fire,
or eat a hole in the floor. The process of finding where it lands is known as
&quot;scatter.&quot; First roll 1d10 and consult the <A HREF="DD00446.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00446.htm">Scatter Diagram</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Next determine how far off the mark the throw is. If the throw is at short
range, use a 6-sided die. If the range is medium, use a 10-sided die. If thrown to
long range, roll 2d10. The number rolled is the number of feet away from the
intended target the missile lands.
<P></P>
The damage taken from a grenade-like attacks depends on whether a direct hit
was scored or the target was in the splash area. <A HREF="DD00447.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00447.htm">Table 45</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> lists the area of effect for a direct hit and damages from direct and splash
hits.
<P></P>
The &quot;area of effect&quot; is the amount of space covered by a direct hit. Any
creature in the area of effect will suffer damage according to the Direct Hit
column. All creatures within 3' of the area of effect are subject to splash damage.
