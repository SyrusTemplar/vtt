This spell is similar to a <I>light</I> spell, except that it is as bright as full daylight and lasts until negated
by magical darkness or by a <I>dispel magic</I> spell. Creatures who suffer penalties in bright light suffer them in this
spell's area of effect. As with the <I>light</I> spell, it can be cast into the air, onto an object, or at a creature. When
cast at a creature, the target gets a saving throw vs. spell; success indicates
that the spell affects the space about 1 foot behind the creature instead. Note
that this spell can also blind a creature if it is successfully cast upon the
creature's visual organs, reducing its attack rolls, saving throws, and Armor
Class by 4. If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed in a
light-proof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the covering is removed.
<P></P>
A continual light brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is
temporarily negated so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in
the overlapping areas of effect. A direct casting of <I>continual light</I> against a similar or weaker magical darkness cancels both.
<P></P>
This spell eventually consumes the material it is cast upon, but the process
takes far longer than the time in the typical campaign. Extremely hard and
expensive materials can last hundreds or even thousands of years.
