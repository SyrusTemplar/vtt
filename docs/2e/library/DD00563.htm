Once the encounter is set and the DM is ready to role-play the situation, he
needs to know how the NPCs or monsters will react. The creatures should react in
the manner the DM thinks is most appropriate to the situation.
<P></P>
If the player characters charge a band of randomly encountered orcs with
weapons drawn, the DM can easily say, &quot;They snarl and leap to the defense!&quot;
Selection of the reaction based on the situation ensures rational behavior and avoids
the illogical results that random die rolls can often give.
<P></P>
However, there are times when the DM doesn't have a clue about what the
monsters will do. This is not a disasterâ€”it's not even all that unusual. When this
happens, the DM can randomly determine an encounter reaction by rolling for a
result on <A HREF="DD00564.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00564.htm">Table 59</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> . To use the table, roll 2d10 and add the numbers on the two dice. Increase
or decrease this number by any modifiers in the creature description or the
morale modifiers (see <A HREF="DD00481.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00481.htm">Table 50</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> in Chapter 9: Combat).
<P></P>
Using the column that most closely matches the behavior of the player
characters, find the entry listed for modified die roll. The result is a general
indication of how the creatures will react. This reaction must be interpreted by the
DM to fit the situation.</FONT><FONT SIZE="2">
