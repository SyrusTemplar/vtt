   Many paladins live in a state of near poverty. Their ethos limits the amount
of money they can save, while living expenses, church tithings, and stronghold
costs put heavy demands on whatever meager funds they manage to acquire. Most
paladins have neither the time, resources, nor aptitude to make a living as
craftsmen or merchants. Business ventures, other than those associated with their
strongholds, are often impractical or forbidden. Paladins from affluent
backgrounds rarely benefit from their families' wealth; their ethos restricts them from
accepting large allowances or handouts, and strict inheritance laws usually
turn most of the holdings over to the state when the parents die. Adding to their
difficulties, most governments and churches require paladins to buy and
maintain their own mounts and equipment, believing they'll take better care of these
items if they owns them outright.

   So where does a paladin get his money? Aside from treasure and rewards, here
are a few of the most common sources:

<P></P>
<P></P>
   Though paladins are expected to serve their government out of loyalty rather
than an expectation of financial reward, many monarchies give their paladins a
small monthly stipend, rarely exceeding 10 gp per month. The paladin is expected
to buy all of his equipment, clothing, and supplies, though the government may
provide him food and a place to live. As the paladin becomes more experienced,
the stipend may increase modestly, perhaps 1-2 gp per level. In most cases,
the stipend ends when the paladin builds his own stronghold.
<P></P>
   Stipends generally aren't available to free-lance paladins, paladins who have
pledged fealty to mentors instead of governments, or paladins who work
primarily or exclusively for churches. Churches may provide room and board, but give
cash only in emergencies. Cash given by a church usually works as a loan, which
the paladin is expected to repay as soon as possible.

<P></P>
<P></P>
   When his government or church is at peace, a paladin may hire out as a
mercenary to friendly monarchies or other employers. The paladin's superiors negotiate
the terms, including the length of service, expected duties, and remuneration.
Ironically, a paladin can earn much more as a mercenary than as a soldier on
salary to his government; monthly wages in excess of 100 gp are common. However,
the paladin may be obliged to pay as much as 90% of his wage to his superiors,
in recompense for the loan of his services.

<P></P>
<P></P>
   A paladin may raise money by securing a loan from his government or church,
using his stronghold or other property as collateral. Collateral requirements and
repayment terms are usually strict. The required collateral may be as much as
100 times the amount of the loan. Monthly payments may be equal to 10-20% of
the amount loaned, paid for a minimum of one year. A paladin may also secure a
loan based on a pledge of future service as a soldier, teacher, or laborer.
Moneylenders are usually agreeable to such arrangements, knowing that a paladin
always keeps his word.

<P></P>
<P></P>
   In times of war, a paladin may capture enemy soldiers or dignitaries, then
demand ransom for their return. Hostage footsoldiers or household staff seldom
bring high ransoms—if any—but a dignitary or other important person can command a
fortune (a &quot;king's ransom&quot;). If he works for a government or church, the
paladin's superiors usually demand a large portion of all ransoms. Ransoming
prisoners is not considered an ethos violation, so long as the prisoners are of good or
neutral alignment; evil-aligned prisoners are usually slain or turned over to
the authorities for disposition.

<P></P>
<P></P>
   In addition to winning small monetary awards in tournaments, paladins may earn
money by ransoming their opponents. Certain tournaments require defeated
opponents to flee the field, taking refuge in nearby forests or mountains. The
victors may pursue. If the victors locate and capture the losers within an allotted
time period (say, by sunset), the losers must pay the victors a ransom for
their release. A typical ransom ranges from 1-10 gp, though ransoms for high-level
opponents may be two or three times that amount. A paladin's superiors usually
skim off a high percentage of all ransoms.
