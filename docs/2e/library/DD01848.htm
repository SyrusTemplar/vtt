With this spell, the caster creates the slightly concave, circular plane of
force known as Tenser's floating disc (after the famed wizard whose greed and
ability to locate treasure are well known). The disc is 3 feet in diameter and
holds 100 pounds of weight per level of the wizard casting the spell. The disc
floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It
floats along horizontally within its range of 20 yards at the command of the
caster, and will accompany him at a movement rate of no more than 6. If unguided,
it maintains a constant interval of 6 feet between itself and the wizard. If the
spellcaster moves beyond range (by moving faster, by such means as a <I>teleport</I> spell, or by trying to take the disc more than 3 feet from the surface
beneath it), or if the spell duration expires, the floating disc winks out of
existence, and whatever it was supporting crashes to the surface beneath it.

The material component of the spell is a drop of mercury.
