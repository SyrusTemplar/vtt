Also known simply as a &quot;bill,&quot; this weapon is derived from an agricultural
tool, the bill hook. Throughout its years of use, the bill's head went through
many changes. Its most common head form is a sharp spike with a sturdy hook whose
inside and outside edges were sharpened, and a cutting blade reminiscent of a
cleaver. The pole length ranges around eight feet.
