This spell may be cast only on creatures with Intelligence of 2 or greater and
the ability to communicate with the caster. The spell interferes with the
victim's ability to make decisions. It prevents the victim from performing any
action without first gaining the permission of the caster or a character designated
by the caster. The victim will heed only the person designated by the caster.
<P></P>
Before the victim undertakes any action, he must gain permission. He will not
follow through with an action until he gains permission. If permission is
denied, the victim cannot act until he thinks of an alternate action and gains
permission for that action.
<P></P>
Every round, the victim must decide his action for that round; at the victim's
initiative, he must ask permission to perform his action. If permission is
denied, the victim can take no other action that round.
<P></P>
The only actions exempt from the need for permission are involuntary actions
such as breathing.
<P></P>
Asking and gaining permission takes only a short amount of time in most cases.
A simple request, such as asking for permission to swing a sword in the middle
of combat, can be accomplished quickly. Complicated requests, such as getting
permission to act on a complicated plan, will naturally take more time. The DM
may consider adding a modifier to the victim's initiative roll in such cases.
