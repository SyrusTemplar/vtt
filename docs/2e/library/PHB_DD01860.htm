This spell enables the wizard to specially prepare a garment so as to hold far
more than it normally could. A finely sewn gown or robe of high-quality
material (at least 50 gp value) is fashioned so as to contain numerous hand-sized
pockets. One dozen is the minimum number. The <I>deeppockets</I> spell then enables these pockets to hold a total of 100 pounds (5 cubic feet
in volume) as if it were only 10 pounds of weight. Furthermore, there are no
discernible bulges where the special pockets are. At the time of casting, the
caster can instead choose to have 10 pockets each holding 10 pounds (? cubic foot
volume each). If the robe or like garment is sewn with 100 or more pockets (200
gp minimum cost), 100 pockets can be created to contain one pound of weight
and 1/6 cubic foot volume each. Each special pocket is actually an
extradimensional holding space.
<P></P>
If the spell duration expires while there is material within the enchanted
pockets, or if a successful <I>dispel magic</I> is cast upon the enchanted garment, all the material suddenly appears around
the wearer and immediately falls to the ground. The caster can also cause all
the pockets to empty with a single command.
<P></P>
In addition to the garment, which is reusable, the material components of this
spell are a tiny golden needle and a strip of fine cloth given a half-twist
and fastened at the ends.
