<I>Player's Option</I> characters can be humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and halflings-or they might
be half-elves, half-orcs, or even half-ogres. DMs can devise additional races
for characters, too, so the choices can be as wide and as colorful as the
campaign in which they adventure.

Players should consult the following <A HREF="DD02888.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02888.htm">table</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, which lists minimum and maximum ability scores for the common races. Minimum
scores are listed to the left of the slashes, maximums to the right. Starting
character statistics must fall within these ranges, though the statistics can
increase and decrease during the course of play. For example, if an elf has his
Dexterity score reduced to less than 6 because he fell afoul of a magical
curse, the character is still an elf. If a halfling drank a potion that increased
his Intelligence to 19, he is still a halfling.
