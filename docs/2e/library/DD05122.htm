If you use the optional rules for damaging armor found in this rule book's <I>Combat </I>chapter, you can also use the Armorer proficiency to repair damaged armor.
<P></P>
It costs the armorer 1/100th the armor's retail value for each Damage Point
that he repairs. Again, that's the cost to the <I>armorer</I>, which assumes that apprentices are doing the work, and unsupervised;
apprentices can perform all armor-repair functions. The cost to the armorer, compared
to the apprentice's wage, shows you how long it takes to repair (2 gp/week for
one apprentice, remember).
<P></P>
<I>Example: A set of chain mail has taken 10 points of damage in combat. The
owner brings it in to be repaired. Retail value of chain mail is 75 gp, so the cost
to repair each point of damage will be .75 gp, or 75 cp. The armorer repairs
the 10 points of damage, which costs him 750 cp (75 sp). This is less than 1 gp,
so the apprentice doing the repairs takes about two days to fix the chain maul
hauberk.
<P></P>
</I> Armorers typically charge a 50% profit on repair jobs. In the example above,
the armorer's cost was 75 sp; therefore, he'd charge the customer about 115 sp
for the repair job.
