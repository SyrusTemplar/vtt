An interesting challenge to player characters, and particularly <I>thief</I> player characters, is the task of protecting some object from an imminent
theft. This story can be combined with the mysterious client plotline to create
another twist.
<P></P>
The PCs can be assigned to move the object somewhere, guarding it on the way,
or simply to protect it where it is. The challenge arises from anticipating the
plans of whatever thieves might be inclined to make the attempt.
<P></P>
Generally, the PCs will be tested with one or two easy probes before the real
challenges occur. The guardianship role can easily be extended through several
gaming sessions, as more and more vigorous attempts to acquire the loot are
mounted.
<P></P>
This storyline is not as well suited for a longrunning campaign as are some of
the others. However, characters who spend most of their time attempting to
obtain items of value might find the change of perspective interesting.
