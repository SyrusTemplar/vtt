Here are some optional rules you can add to combat in your campaign.

All characters are presumed to be better with one hand than the other?in real
life, most people are right-handed, quite a few are left-handed, and only a
very few are truly ambidextrous.
<P></P>
When a character is first created, the player should specify his handedness
(right or left). If he does not specify one, the DM should assume the character
is right-handed.
<P></P>
If a character, for whatever reason, fights with his off-hand instead of his
good hand, he suffers a ?2 penalty to attack rolls with all attacks. For
example, should a character find himself with his right hand chained to a wall, and
yet he needs to draw and throw a dagger and must use his off-hand, he'll then
suffer the ?2 penalty to attack rolls.
<P></P>
If you wish a character to be ambidextrous, consult &quot;Ambidexterity,&quot; below,
under &quot;Weapon Proficiency Slots.&quot;
