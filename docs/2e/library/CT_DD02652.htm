<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Many specialized forms of combat evolved throughout the world in various
locations. Some Roman gladiators were trained to fight with net and trident; Western
Europe developed the joust; and martial arts evolved throughout southern and
eastern Asia. If a character comes from an area where a unique form of combat
has evolved, she may spend a weapon proficiency slot to specialize in that form
of fighting.
<P></P>
Some examples of specialized fighting styles include: rapier and main-gauche,
sabre, fighting sticks or nunchuks, katana and wakizashi, and so on. If a
character spends a proficiency slot to specialize in one of these local styles, she
can choose one of the following benefits:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> A ?1 bonus to Armor Class;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> A +1 bonus to attack rolls;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> The ability to make a free block or trap maneuver without spending an attack
to do so;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> The negation of penalties for fighting with two weapons;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> A free unarmed punch or kick.
<P></P>
<P></P>
For example, specialization in fighting with matched sticks or nunchuks may
confer the negation of the normal ?2/?4 attack penalty for fighting with two
weapons. Rapier and main-gauche specialization may provide the character with an
extra block or trap maneuver with his main-gauche. The DM is the final judge of
what bonus a particular style provides and whether or not a character can
specialize in it.
