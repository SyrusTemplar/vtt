<P></P>
?? Below are three categories of religious edicts, along with several
representative examples. The DM is encouraged to supplement these lists with edicts of his
own. Though the number of edicts varies according to doctrine and
circumstance, it's a rare paladin who isn't required to follow at least one or two edicts
from <I>each</I> category.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
?? Most paladins, regardless of whether they follow a religion or philosophy,
must perform certain rites to affirm their faith. Church officials may establish
some of them; for instance, a paladin may be required to pray before every meal.
Others may be self-imposed; for instance, a paladin may dedicate each battle
to the spirit of his murdered brother. Other examples:
<P></P>
<B>?? Prayer:</B> The most common type of religious expression, prayer takes many forms. A
prayer may be a verbal recitation from a sacred text, several minutes of silent
meditation, or a fresh verse composed anew each morning. A paladin may be required
to pray at a particular time every day (at sunrise or before bed), whenever he
gets a chance (such as once a week), or only when a certain event occurs (the
death of a companion or a falling star).
<P></P>
?<B>? Rituals: </B>A ritual comprises a fixed sequence of actions, performed at a specific time
(the first day of spring, the paladin's birthday) or to recognize a particular
event (the defeat of an enemy, the acquisition of a bonded mount). An endless
variety of rituals is possible: tossing a gem into a volcano, building a shrine
with a specific number of stones, bathing in a stream with a perfumed soap,
immersing a sword in an enemy's ashes.
<P></P>
?? <B>Proselytizing:</B> Some churches require their paladins to proselytize, spreading the word about
their faith and recruiting new converts (an especially strict church might
impose a recruitment quota, requiring a paladin to bring in a minimum number of
converts every year). Alternately, the paladin may invite curious agnostics to
attend religious services or engage skeptics in philosophic dialogues. He may
also (in the absence of suitable clerics) give religious instruction to acolytes,
lead prayer services, and assist with sermons.
<P></P>
<B>?? Symbol:</B> To demonstrate his devotion, the paladin may be obliged to display the symbol
of his faith on his shield, armor, or banner. He may also wear a piece of
jewelry, such as a ring or pendant, inscribed with the symbol.
<P></P>
?? <B>Pilgrimage:</B> The paladin may have to make pilgrimages to a temple, saint's tomb, mountain
peak, cemetery, or other sacred location. Once he arrives, he may be required
to say a prayer, present an offering, or spend the night in meditation. A
pilgrimage may be made on a specific date (a holy holiday or the date of a founder's
death) or within a particular period (once a year or any time before he attains
a new level).

<P></P>
<P></P>
?? The paladin may be expected to perform a variety of military, ceremonial, and
household duties. These duties supplement the routine responsibilities required
of all paladins, as described in Chapter 7. Examples:
<P></P>
?? <B>Eliminate enemies of the faith:</B> All paladins are expected to defend their faith against the forces of evil.
As a minimum, the paladin must protect his church, monastery, or temple from
enemy attacks, and must also seek out and destroy all evil characters and
creatures.
<P></P>
?? Beyond these basic requirements, the paladin's responsibilities depend on
exactly how his faith defines evil. While most faiths accept the standard
definition (that is, the definition in the <I>PH</I>), some define evil more narrowly. It's possible, for instance, for a church
to condemn a particular neutral religion as blasphemous, in which case a paladin
may be obliged to destroy the followers of the neutral religion as if they
were evil (the Votary, described in Chapter 4, is one example). Conversely, a
liberal church may require its paladins to eliminate only chaotic evil characters
and creatures; other evil adversaries may be destroyed, imprisoned, or even
tolerated, as decided by the individual paladin.
<P></P>
?? <B>Healing:</B> In many religions, a paladin's extraordinary healing powers are valued not
only for their practical applications, but also for their sacred implications.
Each healing may be a holy sacrament, proof of the deity's compassion.
<P></P>
?? As a requirement of such a faith, a paladin may have to perform elaborate
healing ceremonies. For example, the paladin may don a golden ritual gown, then lay
hands on an ailing peasant while priestly acolytes chant and sing.
<P></P>
?? In certain primitive religions, priests believe that evil spirits cause
illness. The mere presence of a paladin helps frighten the spirits away. In practice,
a paladin may stay with an infirm patient for days, even weeks, until the
illness passes.
<P></P>
?? A paladin may also be obliged to assist at the beginning and end of life when
a cleric isn't available. During the delivery of a child, a paladin's words
comfort the mother while his touch blesses the new baby with good health. When a
high-ranking priest or important member of the congregation nears death, the
paladin remains at his bedside, acting as a symbolic escort into the next world.

<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
?? Faiths impose behavioral edicts to instill discipline, address the perceived
desires of a deity, or keep their followers submissive. Some behavioral edicts
persist merely as tradition, their meaning no longer understood. Examples
include:
<P></P>
? No facial hair. Heads must be shaven bald (females included) or tonsured.
<P></P>
? Fast for 1?4 days per month. (The DM may impose a ?1 penalty on all ability
checks or combat rolls during this time.)
<P></P>
? Must wear certain clothing (a cap or other head covering, sandals instead of
boots, a knotted belt, a particular color).
<P></P>
? No violent acts in a church burial ground.
<P></P>
? Must leave a portion of food remaining on his plate and a sip of drink in
his cup at the end of a meal (to symbolize temperance).
<P></P>
? May not touch a corpse.
<P></P>
? Must always sleep in a particular way.
<P></P>
? May not use curative powers on animals.
<P></P>
? May fight on a holy day only in self-defense.

<P></P>
<P></P>
?? Compared to his medieval counterpart, the knight of the 10th century was
almost unrecognizable. More outlaw than hero, the pre-feudal knight gloried in
barbarism, ignoring written law in favor of vigilantism. The monarchy, weakened by
infighting and indifference, could do little to control them. While peasants
came to resent and even fear the knights, they lacked the resources to impose
order. Anarchy loomed.
<P></P>
?? Uneasy about the knights' increasing power, the church abdicated its passive
status and resolved to take action. This decision was made for two reasons.
First, the church stood for peace and order, principles the knights openly mocked.
To live up to these sacred ideals, the church had no choice but to assert its
authority. Second were practical considerations. The church depended on peasant
tithes and rental property for income. For its economic survival, the church
had to find a way to suppress knightly greed.
<P></P>
?? The church initiated its ambitious campaign in the late 10th century by
proclaiming the &quot;Peace of God.&quot; Taken literally, the Peace of God renewed the
church's commitment to protecting the lives and property of all people. Implicit in
the proclamation, however, was the notion that those who threatened to disrupt
the social order were enemies not only of the state, but of God himself. Although
no enemies were identified, the proclamation was obviously aimed at the
knights.
<P></P>
?? To enforce the Peace of God, church dignitaries organized a series of
ceremonial affirmations. Held in public forums to guarantee large audiences and maximum
exposure, the dignitaries invited nobles, aristocrats, military officials, and
the knights themselves to pledge a peace-keeping oath. The ceremonies were
conducted with much pomp and solemnity, including the presentation of sacred
relics and special prayers to reaffirm God's omnipotence. Further, the church warned
that anyone who failed to uphold the Peace of God would be excommunicated. It
was a threat not taken lightly. Even the most seditious knights feared an
afterlife in Purgatory?or worse.
<P></P>
?? The church undertook the second phase of its campaign in the early 11th
century by issuing the &quot;Truce of God.'' Unlike the previous proclamation, the Truce
was specifically directed to the knights, spelling out in no uncertain terms the
behavior expected of them in order to remain true to their faith. Knights were
forbidden to attack the clergy under any circumstances, nor were they allowed
to commit violent acts against peasants. They were required to fast on holy
days and refrain from fighting on the weekends. Fearing divine retribution, the
knights grudgingly complied.
<P></P>
?? By the middle 11th century, the church had succeeded in convincing the knights
that they were soldiers of God. As such, they were duty-bound to defend the
church and promote its interests. Reluctantly but irrevocably, the knights
adjusted, abandoning their independence for their new role as divine servants. They
accepted special blessings, participated in sacred rituals, and distinguished
themselves on the field of battle. Once scorned, knights were now respected and
admired.
<P></P>
?? But the benefits gained by the knights paled before those acquired by the
church. Not only had the church built an army of loyal warriors, it had become a
formidable political force. As the church grew in wealth and power, the
distinctions between religion and government gradually blurred. Clerical leaders came to
influence every facet of government. This uneasy alliance persisted for much
of the Middle Ages.
