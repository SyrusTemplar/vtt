</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Before the players announce what their characters are doing this round, the DM
secretly decides what actions the monsters take. Once the DM decides what the
monsters will do, he should stick by it-he-s on his honor not to switch actions
after learning the players? decisions. After all, the monsters don-t know what
the PCs are going to do before they do it. If necessary, the DM can make notes
about monster actions to remind himself of what they intend to do.
<P></P>
Generally, monsters and NPCs have the same actions available to them that the
player characters do. They can charge, attack, or withdraw, just like the PCs.
Monsters normally choose the most advantageous and sensible actions for the
situation. Refer to <A HREF="DD02825.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02825.htm">Chapter Nine</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">: Monsters, for more information.
