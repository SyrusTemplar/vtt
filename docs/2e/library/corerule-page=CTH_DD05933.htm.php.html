</B> This section is for DMs who have a PC in a campaign who has become a
Guildmaster of Thieves. Holding a similar position (e.g., the most powerful member of a
ruling council) can be handled with minor modifications of the system outlined
here for determining guild numbers, activities, economics, brushes with the
law, and similar events in the everyday story of thieving folk.
