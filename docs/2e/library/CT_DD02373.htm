<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">The Battle Map</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The <I>Player?s Option</I> combat system is played on a gridded battle map with 1-inch squares. The
battle map becomes a diagram of the battlefield that can be used with figures,
stand-up counters, or markers. The exact location of each character or creature is
important, since facing and terrain are critical to the tactics of a fight.

A number of games and accessories, such as the <I>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</I>? Adventure Packs, include gridded maps. Feel free to borrow mapboards and
modify them for use in your own campaign.
<P></P>
You can also use dry-erase boards, magnetic dungeon tiles, or washable gridded
mats to portray your battlefield. You can make your own maps to customize the
battlefield for each combat. In fact, it?s a good idea for the DM to prepare
for an encounter by making a map of the battlefield beforehand. As long as the
map is marked in 1-inch squares, it will do.
<P></P>
Some DMs and players may prefer battle maps marked with hexes instead of
squares. Hexes, however, introduce certain inconveniences to the rules that do not
surface with a square grid. (For example, can figures occupy partial hexes near
walls?) Nevertheless, with a few modifications it is certainly possible to
adapt the <I>Player?s Option</I> combat system to a hex grid.
