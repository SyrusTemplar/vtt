Kits are culturally-based. Generally, any kit can be assigned to a specialist
from any school. An Amazon-- one of several kits described below-- might be a
necromancer or an illusionist, while a Mystic-- another type of kit-- could be a
diviner or an abjurer.
<P></P>
However, there are occasional exceptions. Diviners, for instance, require a
high Wisdom score, but the Savage Wizard-- a kit associated with the more
primitive parts of the world-- usually lacks the necessary intuition and insight to
specialize in the school of greater divination. Likewise, there are also some
schools that favor certain kits.
<P></P>
All excluded schools and preferred schools are noted in each kit description.
But these are only suggestions-- a Savage Wizard diviner is perfectly
acceptable if the DM rules that such a character is allowable in his campaign.

Unless the DM determines otherwise, all kits are available to mages
