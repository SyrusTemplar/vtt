<P></P>
<P></P>
Wizards generally begin with the <I>enchant an item </I>spell to focus their magical energy and then cast additional spells to create
the enchantment. If the item has a power that duplicates or closely resembles a
known spell, that is the spell cast to create the enchantment. If the item has
an effect that does not duplicate a known spell, the wizard must either
research a new spell or cast some combination of spells that approximates its
effects. The DM must decide which spells are necessary. See the <A HREF="DD01285.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01285.htm">enchant an item</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>spell description and the Notes to <A HREF="DD01289.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01289.htm">Table 23</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> section for more details. Most items also require a <I>permanency </I>spell to complete the enchantment.
<P></P>
Wizards lose a point of Constitution when casting the <I>permanency </I>spell most magical items require. Priests do not normally suffer this loss,
but the DM can rule that the long process that a priest must undertake is so
physically taxing that it drains a point of Constitution. This loss applies only to
items that would require a <I>permanency </I>spell if the item was created by a wizard.
<P></P>
Priests do not have the <I>enchant an item </I>spell, and they must petition their deities to instill power into their items.
The procedure is described in Chapter 10 of the <A HREF="DMG_DD00530.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00530.htm">Dungeon Master Guide</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Item: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The type of item being created. These are divided into the same general
categories as used in Appendix 3 of the <A HREF="DMG_DD00699.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00699.htm">Dungeon Master Guide</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> and are further subdivided by how they can be used.
<P></P>
<I>Single use:</I> Using the item once completely consumes its magic, often consuming the item
itself. Examples include virtually all potions, scrolls, dusts, oils, and
elixirs.
<P></P>
<I>Limited use:</I> The item can be used a fixed number of times before it is consumed. Some
limited-use items can be recharged, and some have multiple functions (see the <A HREF="DD01286.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01286.htm">Item Details</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> section). This includes most rods, staves, and wands as well as some rings
and miscellaneous magical items.
<P></P>
<I>Single Function:</I> The item has only one power, which usually functions continuously or on
demand. Some single-function items expend charges when used. An <I>amulet of proof against detection and location, cloak of displacement</I>, and <I>ring of multiple wishes</I> are all examples of this type of magic.
<P></P>
<I>Multiple Function:</I> The item has more than one power. Some multiple function items are charged
(and also are limited-use items) and some are not. Noncharged items of this
nature include <I>scarabs of protection, crystal balls</I>, and <I>hammers of thunderbolts</I>.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Material:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>The more powerful the item, the more unusual the material from which it is
made. Materials are classified by their rarity.
<P></P>
<I>Common:</I> The material is fairly plentiful under normal circumstances. Steel, oak
staves, copper, and wool are common materials.
<P></P>
<I>Rare:</I> The material is expensive and difficult to find. Silk, diamonds, roc
feathers, and ebony are rare materials. Common materials gathered under unusual
circumstances are also considered rare. Wood taken from a lightning-struck oak, wool
made from fleece taken at a lamb's first shearing, and steel made in a furnace
tended by a dwarven elder are rare materials.
<P></P>
<I>Exotic:</I> The material is unique or unusual and cannot be purchased-the character must
undertake an adventure to obtain it. Exotic materials often exist only in a
metaphorical sense. Steel smelted from the ore of a fallen star, the moon's tears,
the largest scale from a great wyrm's tail, and a lock of a goddess's hair are
exotic materials. Common or rare materials gathered in extraordinary
circumstances are also considered exotic. Cloth spun from phase spider silk under the
new moon, a diamond freely given from a dragon's belly, and wood taken from a
lightning-struck treant are exotic materials.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Processes:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>A process is a prescribed method for accomplishing a specific task that is
performed in addition to the normal steps necessary for making the item. Like
materials, processes are classified according to rarity. For example, making a mold
to cast a ring is not a process because creating a mold is a typical step in
ring-making. However, making the ring's mold from a wax model fashioned from
beeswax taken from a hive of giant bees is a process because it is unusual. It-s
not always easy to distinguish processes from materials, but the distinction is
not important as long as the item is created using the required number of
special elements.
<P></P>
<I>Common:</I> The process is fairly simple and straightforward, requiring only special care
or some unusual preparations. Quenching a sword in snow from a spring storm,
encrusting a ring with ornamental gems, and tempering a helmet in a furnace
heated with lava are common processes.
<P></P>
<I>Rare:</I> The process requires extra effort or extraordinary expense. Quenching a
sword's blade in snow gathered at the top of the world, honing a sword blade with a <I>stone of good luck</I>, and etching an amulet with acid from a giant slug's spittle are rare
processes.
<P></P>
<I>Exotic:</I> The process is unique or unusual and cannot be purchased-the character must
undertake an adventure to complete it. Exotic processes often exist only in a
metaphorical sense. Quenching a sword blade in a lover's sigh, heating a ring in
burning ice, and bathing a shield in a knight's courage are exotic processes.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cost:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>This is what the character must spend for unusual fuels and other supplies
when making the item. This cost is in addition to whatever the character spends on
workers? salaries, travel, professional fees, and purchasing the materials and
processes necessary for making the item.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Time:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>This is the time required to actually manufacture the item once the material
components have been gathered. It does not include time spent acquiring the
materials and placing enchantments on the item. Time cannot be reduced by hiring
extra workers, getting help from another character, or spending additional money.
