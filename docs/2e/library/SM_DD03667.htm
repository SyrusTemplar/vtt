By means of this spell, the priest can accurately estimate the chance of
success of one specific action, such as climbing a dangerous cliff, making a trick
bowshot, crossing a burning room unharmed, or even striking an enemy. The action
in question must be one that would normally be resolved by a die roll, but the
priest doesn?t have to be the person who attempts the feat; he can use <I>calculate</I> to estimate the odds for anyone taking an action in his sight. The priest has
a 70% chance, +2% per level, of making an accurate estimate.
<P></P>
If successful, the DM reveals to the player the action?s chance for success or
any modifiers that may be in play. For example, he could reveal a particular
opponent?s Armor Class or THAC0, the saving throw an opponent would require in
order to save against a particular spell cast by the priest or the priest?s
wizard companion, or a character?s chance to open doors, bend bars, or use a thief
ability. The priest could even <I>calculate </I>his odds for actions that might be resolved by a die roll or DM caprice, such
as his chance to avoid detection by hiding behind a rock. This spell takes into
account factors that the priest himself may not be aware of, so from time to
time a character may receive some very confusing results from this spell. For
instance, if the priest doesn?t know that an orc chieftain is actually a
polymorphed tanar?ri masquerading as an orc, he may be astonished to learn that the
?orc? has a THAC0 of 7!
<P></P>
If the priest fails his calculation check with a roll of 99 or 00, his
calculation is wildly skewed in a random fashion. The material component for this
spell is a miniature abacus of ivory worth at least 100 gp. It is not consumed in
the casting of the spell.
