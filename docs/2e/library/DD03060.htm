<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Mountaineering:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character with this proficiency is skilled in the use of hammer and pitons
(spikes) to secure a route up a mountainside. He also knows how to use the rope
and brackets that can link a party of climbers. A proficient character can
make a route across a steep section of rocks, and by the use of ropes allow other,
non-proficient characters to follow.

No proficiency check is required unless the DM declares that a route is very
perilous—steeply pitched, with few hand- and foot-holds, and those that exist
are tiny or loose. If a character connected to the mountaineer by rope falls, the
mountaineering character can make a proficiency check; success means that the
other’s fall has been arrested. Failure means that the other character
continues to fall, and failure by a roll of 20 means that the mountaineer is pulled
down, too.
<P></P>
Characters with the mountaineering proficiency can add their proficiency
rating to their percentage chance of climbing any surface; this includes thieves
