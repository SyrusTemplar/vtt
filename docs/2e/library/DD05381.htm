?? A paladin can restore lost hit points to himself, another character, or a
natural animal with the <I>laying on hands</I> ability. To use this ability, the paladin briefly presses both palms against
the damaged character or creature-usually against the temple or chest, but any
surface of the body will do. Touching the skin directly isn't necessary. The
paladin may be gloved or the subject may be wearing clothing, so long as the
paladin presses hard enough for the recipient to feel the pressure.
<P></P>
?? Laying on hands works automatically, restoring a number of hit points equal to
twice the paladin's experience level (see <A HREF="DD05380.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD05380.htm">Table 12</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). A paladin can use this ability only once per day, and only on a single
character or creature. The following restrictions also apply:
<P></P>
? The recipient can't recover more hit points than he normally has. If a
6th-level paladin lays hands on a character who's lost a total of 3 hit points, the
character recovers exactly 3 hit points and no more. Though the paladin could
theoretically restore 12 hit points, the excess are &quot;lost&quot; in this case.
<P></P>
? The recipient must still be alive. Laying on hands can't bring dead
characters back to life.
<P></P>
? Laying on hands doesn't cure diseases-that requires a different paladin
power (discussed earlier). However, laying on hands may restore hit points lost to
disease or poison. (Note that laying on hands doesn't negate poison or lengthen
its onset time; the <I>neutralize poison</I> and <I>slow poison</I> spells cause these effects.)
<P></P>
? If the paladin is unconscious or immobile, a companion can't pick up the
paladin's hands and heal himself or anyone else. Laying on hands requires the
paladin's willful participation.
<P></P>
? Laying on hands won't work unless the paladin employs both hands at the same
time. Before using this ability, he must sheath his sword, put down his bag,
or take whatever other actions are necessary to free his hands. If he's
disabled-for example, if he's lost an arm in an accident-he may petition the gods to
allow him to heal with a single hand. Assuming the paladin has served honorably,
the gods probably grant his request.
