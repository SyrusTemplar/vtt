However characters acquire new spells, always remember that you are in charge.
You have complete control over what spells the player characters get.
<P></P>
If a player character has a spell you don't like or one that severely disrupts
or unbalances your game, it is not the player's fault. Who gave the character
the spell? Who allowed it in the game? Controlling spell acquisition is an
important responsibility. Consider your choices carefully.
<P></P>
By keeping the selection of spells limited, you automatically increase their
importance and value to the wizards in your campaign. A simple scroll with a
single spell becomes a real treasure if it has a spell on it the wizard has never
seen. This gives the player a touch choice. Should he cast the scroll during an
adventure where it might be useful? Should he save it until he can take the
time to research the spell for his spell books?
<P></P>
When the characters overcome a hostile mage, the first concern of the wizard
will be for his spell book. Where is it? What spells does it have in it? Even a
nonmagical item like a spell book becomes very important. Knowing their value,
NPC wizards will go to great pains to protect their own spell books, hiding
them carefully, locking them in trapped chests, and scattering magical traps
throughout the pages.
