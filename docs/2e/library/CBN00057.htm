</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This ability enables the necromancer to see or hear activity through any skull
or cadaveric head. The skull or head must not be attached to a spine, nor can
it be animated. The necromancer can scry through any disembodied skull or head
(at a known location) that is up to one mile away per point of the wizardâ€™s
Intelligence. In some cases, other types of sensory links may be used with the
skull scry ability. The DM should refer to the spells <I>spectral voice</I> and <I>corpse link</I> in Chapter Four for further inspiration.
