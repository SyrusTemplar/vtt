A character with the herbalist proficiency may use herbs as an adjunct to the
healing skill, as explained in <A HREF="PHB_DD01570.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01570.htm">Chapter 5 of the PH</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">

(p. 59). However, some druids possess exceptional herb lore, which enables
them to produce magical herbal brews. Druids who devote at least three slots to
the herbalism proficiency can create these brews.
<P></P>
An <I>herbal brew</I> is a concoction of several herbs (and sometimes fungi or tree bark) that
produces exotic effects. The name of a brew does not refer to the herbs in it, but
to its effects. Herbal brews require no magical plants; power comes from the
combination of herbs and the secret techniques herbalist druids use in each stage
of preparation.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Finding an herbal brew's ingredients requires first locating the right place
to look. The druid must search in the proper terrain for the time indicated in
the brew's listing (starting on p. 105). Then, make an herbalism proficiency
check, applying the brew's search modifier and a -4 penalty for snow-covered
ground or darkness, if applicable.
<P></P>
Success means the druid locates enough herbs to produce one brew; failure
means the character finds none. In either case, additional searches may be made,
though a druid really should search only once per square mile of appropriate
terrain. Repeated searches of an area carry a cumulative -2 penalty--there may be
nothing there to find!

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Most herbs work best while fresh, but druids may wish to store some for future
use rather than immediately turning them into brews. Preserving ingredients by
drying, powdering, and packing the herbs takes six hours per set of
ingredients (enough for one brew) and requires a successful herbalism check.
<P></P>
The DM makes this roll, informing the player whether the ingredients have
spoiled only when the druid tries to use them in a brew. A successful roll ensures
the herbs stay fresh while in a waterproof container. Failure indicates they
will spoil in 1d6 days.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Making an Herbal Brew
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
To create an herbal brew, the druid must have the appropriate ingredients,
either fresh or preserved. The brewing process requires a quiet place that fosters
deep concentration. It involves both physical work (chopping and cleaning
herbs, mixing the ingredients in proper portions, steaming them, etc.) and ritual
gestures and prayer. As with granted powers and spells, if the druid has not
remained faithful to the Order, the herbs fail to take on their magical properties.
<P></P>
After preparing the concoction as long as the brew's description requires, the
druid rolls another herbalism proficiency check, using the modifiers shown. In
addition, a -2 modifier applies if the druid used preserved rather than fresh
herbs. A successful check means the druid creates the brew. Failure means the
druid ruins the ingredients; a roll of 19 or 20 always fails.
<P></P>
A druid with several sets of ingredients for the same herbal brew may mix
multiple batches at the same time. If the final proficiency check succeeds, the
druid concocts all the batches; if it fails, the ingredients all go to waste.

Types of Herbal Brews
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The next several pages offer descriptions of various herbal brews. Feel free
to create new ones for your own druid characters.
<P></P>
Each brew entry includes these details:
<P></P>
<B>Terrain </B>tells where to find ingredients for the brew, as well as any special notes
(gather only at night, etc.).
<P></P>
<B>Search Time/Modifier</B> indicates how many hours a druid must search for the brew?s ingredients and
offers a modifier to the herbalism proficiency check that determines whether the
druid finds them.
<P></P>
<B>Preparation Time/Modifier</B> suggests how many hours it takes the druid to prepare the brew and offers a
modifier to the herbalism proficiency check needed for successful brewing.
<P></P>
<B>Application</B> tells how to apply the brew: either as a tea, ointment, poultice, or vapor.
<P></P>
A <I>tea</I> consists of a mix of broken or crushed dried herbs infused into water. The
rules for drinking potions apply to herbal teas, which keep indefinitely in dry
form.
<P></P>
An <I>ointment</I> is a brew mixed with lard, beeswax, lanolin, or another similar base and
rubbed onto skin. Treat it as a magical oil.
<P></P>
A <I>poultice</I> consists of a damp herbal brew bandaged onto a wound or area of skin. The
contents of the poultice soaks into the skin gradually. Applying a poultice takes
two rounds; it can be applied only to an unresisting or grappled subject.
<P></P>
A <I>vapor</I>, a mixture intended to be inhaled rather than drunk, usually affects an area.
The dry ingredients must be stirred into boiling water so the brew's recipient
can breathe in the steam. Administration requires two rounds and a source of
hot water.
<P></P>
<B>Effects</B> describes what the brew does.
<P></P>
<B>Save</B> explains what kind of saving throw, if any, can resist the brews effects.
Most saving throws are against poison even if a brew is not actually deadly.

</B> <B>Terrain:</B> Swamp and deep forest
<P></P>
<B>Search Time/Modifier:</B> 6/-1
<P></P>
<B>Preparation Time/Modifier:</B> 2/-1
<P></P>
<B>Application:</B> Ointment
<P></P>
<B>Effects:</B> This ointment strongly repels insects. Anyone covered head to foot in it
remains unaffected by normal insects, even those summoned by spells such as <I>creeping doom</I> and <I>insect plague</I>. Giant insects still may attack the character, but do so at a -3 penalty, due
to their revulsion.
<P></P>
<B>Save:</B> None

<P></P>
<B>Preparation Time/Modifier: </B>10/-4
<P></P>
<B>Application:</B> Ointment
<P></P>
<B>Effects:</B> A character who smears this ointment over both eyes becomes blind within two
rounds. However, the character can see invisible, astral, ethereal, or illusory
objects as if they were real and fully visible.
<P></P>
<B>Save:</B> Neg. if save vs. spell
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Deathmock
<P></P>
</B> <B>Terrain:</B> Mountain slopes
<P></P>
<B>Search Time/Modifier:</B> 4/-3
<P></P>
<B>Preparation Time/Modifier: </B>6/-3
<P></P>
<B>Application:</B> Tea
<P></P>
<B>Effects:</B> <I>Deathmock</I> causes drinkers to fall into a cataleptic trance; characters display muscle
rigidity and do not appear to breathe or have a heartbeat. While injuries cause
them little bleeding, they otherwise suffer normal damage. Those under the
influence of this tea sleep for 2d4 days, during which time they need no food or
water. They need only one-twentieth the air unaffected people do and can survive
freezing temperature.
<P></P>
<B>Save:</B> Neg. if save vs. poison
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Fiendflower
<P></P>
</B> <B>Terrain:</B> Deep forest or jungle
<P></P>
<B>Search Time/Modifier:</B> 12/-4
<P></P>
<B>Preparation Time/Modifier:</B> 8/-3
<P></P>
<B>Application:</B> Tea
<P></P>
<B>Effects:</B> Characters who drink this bitter tea see horrifying visions that drive them
temporarily mad. After 1d20 turns, drinkers suffer an episode of 2d6 minutes,
during which they turn enraged, violent, and homicidal; such a PC should be
played by the DM. Afterward, drinkers cannot recall what happened during the
episode, which recurs once per day (at irregular intervals) for the next 2d4 days. A <I>neutralize poison</I> spell ends <I>fiendflower's </I>effects.
<P></P>
<B>Save:</B> Neg. if save vs. spell
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Ghostroot

<B>Search Time/Modifier:</B> 8/-4
<P></P>
<B>Preparation Time/Modifier:</B> 4/-6
<P></P>
<B>Application:</B> Vapor
<P></P>
<B>Effects:</B> This mixture's luminous vapors repel undead. Any undead attempting to draw
near must save vs. spell. Failure prevents them from approaching within 10 feet
of the steaming brew. Success allows them to ignore its effects; once they save,
they remain immune to the brew for the rest of the day. The vapors last for
one turn.
<P></P>
<B>Save:</B> Neg. if save vs. spell
<P></P>

<P></P>
<B>Application:</B> Tea
<P></P>
<B>Effects:</B> Within an hour of drinking the tea, characters fall in love with the first
person of the opposite sex they see. The drinkers, while not <I>charmed</I>, act besotted and devote all efforts to wooing their love. The effects last
for 2d4 days unless a player rolled a 20 on the save; in that case they are
permanent.
<P></P>
<B>Save:</B> Neg. if save vs. spell
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Wintersalve
<P></P>
</B> <B>Terrain:</B> Mountain slopes or tundra

<P></P>
<B>Preparation Time/Modifier:</B> 6/-3
<P></P>
<B>Application:</B> Ointment
<P></P>
<B>Effects:</B> This ointment, when smeared over exposed body parts, provides the same
protection against cold that a heavy fur coat would, but without the encumbrance.
Combined with winter clothing, it allows for survival below zero and gives a +1
bonus to saving throws against cold-based attacks.
<P></P>
<B>Save:</B> None
