If you decide a character is too powerful, the player has two choices. First,
he can agree to weaken the character in some fashion (subject to your
approval). This may be as simple as excluding a few magical items (&quot;No, you can't bring
that<I> holy avenger sword +5</I> that shoots 30-dice fireballs into my campaign!&quot;). Second, the player can
agree not to use some special ability (&quot;I don't care if your previous DM gave your
character the Evil Eye, you can't jinx my dice rolls!&quot;). If this sort of
change seems too drastic or requires altering ability scores or levels, a better
option is simply to have the player create a new character. The old character can
be used, without tinkering, in the campaign for which he was created. The new
character, more appropriate to your campaign, can develop in your game. Remember
that just because another DM allowed something is no reason you have to do the
same!
