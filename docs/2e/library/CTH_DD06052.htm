Finally, the thief campaign should ideally include a multiplicity of
opportunities for thieves to employ their own unique talents. Most significantly, this
means many opportunities to pick locks, to find and remove traps, to climb sheer
surfaces, and so on.

The DM should additionally tailor the challenges to the specific type of
adventure suitable to the thief or thieves in the campaign. A character with great
proficiency in disguise, for example, should have opportunities to use a cover
identity, or to find work as a spy.

By successfully creating challenges that match the particular strengths of the
player characters (of all classes), the PCs have a chance to carve out a solid
niche for themselves in the campaign world.
