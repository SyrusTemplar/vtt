   By flattening his body or crouching in such as way as to blend into dark
areas, and remaining perfectly still while doing so, the ranger can render himself
nearly invisible in natural surroundings. This ability to hide in shadows works
equally well in fields of tall grass, clumps of bushes, rocky hills, or any
other wilderness area with dark or shaded terrain.
<P></P>
   When hiding, the ranger can conceal himself from attackers and eavesdrop on
his enemies. He can hide near a well-traveled road and secretly observe
passersby, or conceal himself near an enemy campsite, waiting for an opportune moment to
steal their treasure or supplies.
<P></P>
   Table 8 in Chapter 1 gives the base chance for a ranger to hide in shadows,
subject to the modifiers for race, Dexterity and armor (Tables 9-11). The
following restrictions also apply:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> If attempting to hide in shadows on city streets, inside a building, or in any
other non-wilderness setting, the ranger's chance is halved. Apply this
reduction after all the other modifiers have been taken into account.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The ranger must be unobserved while attempting to conceal himself. If an NPC
or creature is watching him, the ranger can't hide successfully. If the NPC or
creature becomes distracted, even momentarily, the ranger can slip into the area
of concealment and attempt to hide.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> While hiding, the ranger must remain immobile, except for slow and careful
movements, such as readying a weapon or sipping from a flask.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> If the area is completely dark--for instance, if there's an overcast sky in
the dead of night--the ranger gains no special advantages from hiding in shadows,
and can't use this ability.
<P></P>
   If all these conditions are met, the DM rolls percentile dice as soon as the
ranger has concealed himself. The DM doesn't tell the ranger the result of the
roll; rather, the ranger learns if the attempt is successful from the reactions
of those in the area.
<P></P>
   If the check is less than or equal to the ranger's adjusted hide in shadows
score, the ranger has successfully concealed himself. He's essentially invisible
to all others in the area, including his companions. He has hidden successfully
until he changes locations; an attempt to hide in shadows in a different area
requires a new die roll. Characters using spells or magical items that reveal
hidden or invisible objects can detect him. Likewise, creatures who use their
sense of smell to locate prey or other exceptionally keen senses have their
normal chance of sniffing out a ranger hiding in shadows.
<P></P>
   If the check is greater than the ranger's hide in shadows score, he's failed
to conceal himself and is as exposed as any normal character would be in the
same area. This doesn't necessarily mean that others will notice him, especially
if the area of concealment provides a lot of natural cover, such as a cluster of
bushes or the long shadow from a tall tree. However, the ranger may not know
if he's succeeded or failed until it's too late--for instance, if an NPC
suddenly turns and charges.
