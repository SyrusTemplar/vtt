Players are encouraged to alter the above personality types in any way they
see fit. Characteristics of one personality can be combined with characteristics
of another to create brand new types (Brooding Commanders are possible, as are
Obsessive Mystery Men). The DM is also free to modify the personality types and
make suggestions to his players. As always, the DM has the right to forbid the
players from choosing extreme personalities for their characters; for
instance, the DM might decide that Mercenaries are too disruptive to his campaign and
suggest an alternative to his players.
<P></P>
Sometimes, a player might wish to change his character's personality. Maybe
the character has matured and outgrown his old personality type. Or maybe the
character has reached a turning point in his life that has forced him to change
his outlook or rethink his philosophy.
<P></P>
Since the personality types are not governed by a strict set of rules, players
can change them whenever appropriate. However, such changes should be rare,
and typically should mark a major turning point in his life; a player should not
change his character's personality just for the sake of trying something new. A
personality change should develop naturally out of the events of the campaign,
perhaps as a result of a catastrophic event; for instance, an Altruist might
become a Brooder because a friend or family member was brutally murdered by a
hoard of pillaging orcs.
<P></P>
Following are some ways such changes might occur.
<P></P>
The Altruist may become disillusioned when a formerly trusted companion sells
him out or when he realizes that his good intentions are unappreciated by the
commoners he has vowed to defend. This Altruist might then become a Brooder. If
his altruism turns to cynicism, he might decide to become a Mercenary.
<P></P>
The Brooder may experience an enlightening event that gives him a more
positive attitude; for instance, he could earn the admiration of a child or he could
fall in love. Since he is sensitive and introspective by nature, a former
Brooder could become a Counselor.
<P></P>
The Commander could become fed up with the constant responsibility for the
others in his party, or the burden of command could begin to overwhelm him.
Depending on his disposition, he could become a Brooder, a Counselor, an Altruist, or
even an Intimidator. Regardless of his change (unless he is consumed with
bitterness or completely amoral) he'll still have leadership tendencies and likely
will find the urge to give orders impossible to resist.
<P></P>
The Counselor isn't likely to change, since his personality type is associated
with maturity and experience. He could temporarily become a Commander if no
one else was available, but most other personalities are so contrary to his
nature that he would find it difficult to change himself.
<P></P>
The Intimidator is not likely to change much, either. Possibly, falling in
love or experiencing some other dramatically positive experience could soften him
enough to make him consider changing his outlook. In time, a reformed
Intimidator could become a Counselor, or he could eventually assume the duties of a
Commander.
<P></P>
The Mercenary could easily become an Obsessive if he becomes consumed with
acquiring an impossibly large amount of treasure or locating an artifact that does
not exist. Exposure to the world's impoverished and neglected might encourage
him to change his ways and become an Altruist.
<P></P>
The Mystery Man could become just about any other personality type (except a
Neophyte) once he decides to abandon his veil of secrecy.
<P></P>
The Neophyte will eventually become more mature and lose his youthful naivete.
His experiences in the campaign will probably suggest a new personality for
him. (Note that it is extremely unlikely that a character will change from his
current personality into a Neophyte; that would probably require the character to
lose his memory and become young again.)
<P></P>
The Obsessive will not change unless he gives up his obsession, in which case
he will likely become a Brooder. If he reaches his goal, he could become nearly
any personality type.
<P></P>
The Showman might be forced to assume more responsibility and become a
Commander, or he could become disillusioned with constantly trying to win the approval
of others and become a Brooder. If he begins charging money for his
performances, he might be tempted to become a Mercenary. A Showman bent on developing the
ultimate magical effect might risk becoming an Obsessive.
