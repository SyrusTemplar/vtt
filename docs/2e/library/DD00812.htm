<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ring of Wishes, Multiple:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This ring contains from 2d4 <I>wish</I> spells. As with any wish, the DM should be very judicious in handling the
request. If players are greedy and grasping, interpret their wording exactly,
twist the wording, or simply rule the request is beyond the power of the magic. In
any case, the wish is used up, whether or not the wish was granted, and
regardless of the DM's interpretation of the wisher's request. No wish can cancel the
decrees of god-like beings, unless it comes from another such creature.
