paper, wood, dead flesh, etc.), it allows that substance to resist the passage
of time. Each year of actual time affects the substance as if only a day had
passed. The coated object has a +1 bonus on all saving throws. The oil never wears
off, although it can be magically removed. One flask contains enough oil to
coat eight man-sized objects, or an equivalent area.
