<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Treasure Findings</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>:</B> A <I>potion of treasure finding</I> empowers the drinker with a location sense, so that he can point to the
direction of the nearest mass of treasure. The treasure must be within 240 yards,
and its mass must equal metal of at least 10,000 copper pieces or 100 gems or any
combination.
<P></P>
Note that only valuable metals (copper, silver, electrum, gold, platinum,
etc.) and gems (and jewelry, of course) are located. The potion won't locate
worthless metals or magical items which don't contain precious metals or gems. The
imbiber of the potion can &quot;feel'' the direction in which the treasure lies, but
not its distance.
<P></P>
Intervening substances other than special magical wards or lead-lined walls
will not withstand the powers that the liquor bestows upon the individual. The
effects of the potion last for 5d4 rounds. (Clever players will attempt
triangulation.)
