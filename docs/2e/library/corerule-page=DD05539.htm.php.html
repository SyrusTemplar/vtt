This god is a god of some forces that humans fear. However, this doesn't mean
the god is evil. Generally, he's not. He's just the embodiment of darkness,
including all its benefits and all its dangers. The god of Darkness and Night
would be the god of sleep, of dreams, of nightmares, and of nocturnal predators;
some of these traits are considered good, some ill.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are interested in making sure that man regards
Darkness and Night with a reverential awe # making sure that the sentient humanoid
races appreciate the virtues of night while still respecting or fearing its more
frightening aspects. These priests tend to be more aloof from the common man
than priests of many other gods.
<P></P>
Lesser gods of this attribute would be gods of only one of these factors. One
might be the god of Sleep, and another the god of Nightmares. In these cases,
the DM can choose to vary the god's alignment; the god of Sleep, much beloved of
men, could be lawful good, while the god of Nightmares, hated by men, could be
chaotic evil.
<P></P>
Gods of darkness or night are most likely to be female.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Dawn, Death,
Elemental Forces, Hunting, Light, Magic, Moon, Oracles/Prophecy, and Sun. Some DMs
may be surprised that the gods of Darkness and Night are not listed here as
being opposed to those of light and sun. It's because they don't have to be; in
Greek mythology, for instance, the sun-god, moon-goddess, and dawn-goddess were
all siblings who never opposed one another. Naturally, the individual DM can
decide for his campaign that the deities of darkness and light, moon and sun are
enemies.
