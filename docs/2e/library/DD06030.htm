A thief with an exceptional ability at animal handling and training can
sometimes train creatures to assist him in his profession. This section discusses
three possible creature assistants: dogs, ferrets, and monkeys. Other types can be
used given the approval of the DM; develop and define the abilities of the
animal using these three as examples.
<P></P>
All animal training acts described below are useable with the standard
proficiency rules. The main additions are specific tasks that can be learned by these
creatures.
<P></P>
When an animal learns one of the specific tasks below, its chance of
performing the task are determined by the proficiency of its trainer. The proficiency
check required of the animal is the same as for its trainer. For example, a
ferret is trained to fetch gems by a character with three slots of animal handling
proficiency and a Wisdom of 15. He needs a proficiency check of 17 or less to
train the ferret for the task. The ferret, consequently, needs a roll of 17 or
less to fetch the gems properly.
<P></P>
Players should record the stats for animals on the PC character sheet. List
the tasks each animal has been trained for, recording this proficiency number
beside the notation.
<P></P>
At the DM's option, some animals may have such exceptional intelligence, or
strength, or speed, that their ratings are granted a +1 or, rarely, a +2 modifier
to specific tasks.
<P></P>
Dogs can serve primarily as protectors, requiring little training before they
become alert and aggressive watchdogs.
<P></P>
Dogs can also be trained to track a character or other animal. The dog
requires some scent information about the object being tracked and a general location
of the trail. A proficiency check is made to find the trail. Another check must
be made every 1-4 turns, and also whenever the trail takes an unusual turn
(through water, along tree limbs, etc). Dogs specially bred for this (including
many hounds) gain a +1 or +2 to this particular ability.
<P></P>
Dogs can sometimes be trained to perform the &quot;Thief's Fetch&quot; trick, below.
Generally, small and nimble dogs are used for this task.
<P></P>
Ferrets can fit through openings as narrow as 2&quot;, and thus have an ability to
go places other animals cannot. Ferrets can be taught the &quot;Thief's Fetch&quot; trick
to acquire gems, coins, or other small objects.
<P></P>
Monkeys are the most adaptable of these animals. A monkey can be trained to be
selective in its fetching. Gateways, high windows, and other obstacles can
easily be traversed by a monkey. A monkey will fight to defend itself if cornered
or seized.
