<P></P>
<B> Key Idiosyncrasies:</B> Marmel has a paranoid belief pertaining to servants of a long-dead master
seeking him out to kill him, as explained below. More mundanely, he has an
inordinate fondness for humbugs and will cheerfully suck his way through a large bag
of them given the chance. As a result, most of his teeth have fallen out, and
his speech contains many breezily gumless sibilants.
<P></P>
<B>Cover:</B> None; Marmel spends his time in hiding; see below.
<P></P>
<B>Guild and Leadership:</B> The Monmurg thieves' guild has a complex/mix structure—specifically, it has a
ruling council (of 4) elected by allegedly democratic elections from the guild
membership for 7-year terms. The leadership style of this council is strong,
just, and populist. Marmel isn't much affected by all this, because he doesn't
get involved in guild politics and council members (of whatever persuasion)
appreciate his loyalty and usefulness to the guild.
<P></P>
<B>History:</B> Marmel Raveiz is quartermaster of the thieves' guild in Monmurg, capital city
of the Hold of the Sea Princes in Oerth (see World of Greyhawk for some
additional details). He keeps the magical items the guild possesses as a group,
stocks of specialist thief equipment, and ledgers and accounts of the guild
(membership dues and the like). These are all retained in his <I>bags of holding</I>. Marmel is not an expert fence, although he may use his Appraising
proficiency to purchase and check items for the guild.
<P></P>
Marmel began life as an apprentice to a Furyondian mage, and had to suffer
ill-treatment as the mage developed an insidious form of insanity. His master
refused to allow Marmel to make his own way in the world, but the unfortunate
apprentice got his chance when the mage was forced to accompany a Furyondian naval
foray against some of the declining piratical force of the Sea Princes. Their
ship was sunk, and Marmel took the opportunity to kill his hateful and cruel
master, grab a couple of travelling spell books with low-level spells, and <I>levitate</I> to safety. The pirates decided to capture him rather than shoot him down,
their own flying mage bringing down the unhappy apprentice, and Marmel became a
reluctant pirate.
<P></P>
As piracy declined in the Sea Prince's lands, Marmel stayed with bad company
in the form of thieves. His magic helped them, and they trained him. Marmel got
safety and obscurity, staying in the guild house, in return for learning the
skills of the thief. Marmel was very fearful that his old master might have been
raised; his mage's guild might come looking for him; the old mage's relatives
might come for him; in short, obscurity suited Marmel perfectly. It even
overcame his fear of going robbing by night, and Marmel began an adventuring life anew
as a thief, not wanting to work further as a mage, lest those he feared would
be looking for a hapless young mage should find him and punish him for killing
his master.
<P></P>
Marmel is not now an active, adventuring thief. He is too valuable to the
guild to be allowed to risk this. Happily, he has retired to a life of
quartermastering. He maintains and administers the finances of the guild, and shepherds
supplies and magical items for use by guild members. The availability of supplies
is always good, due to Marmel's lines of supply and meticulous checks on his
stocks. He also evaluates items brought in to the guild house by thieves, who
must pay a 10% flat tithe of all earnings to the guild. Marmel's tripled
Appraising proficiency makes him highly valuable in this respect. He routinely uses
detect magic on anything which looks even remotely interesting. He can use an
identify spell, and also has a wand of identification (duplicates the effects of an
identify spell, with no Con loss to the mage) if several items turn up at once
and the &quot;owner&quot; is in a hurry for any reason (he is reluctant to use his wand,
since he can't recharge it, and charges 150 gp per charge for this service). If
he is curious or suspicious about a guild member, or a seller to the guild, he
will use investigative spells (or hypnotism) to learn more.
<P></P>
Marmel is a gentle enough soul, rather other-worldly at times. He likes a spot
of haggling, although it's almost impossible to get the better of him. He has
a strange fondness for heraldry, and may purchase items with unusual heraldic
design for himself. He has a modest fortune from his own thieving days, and is
paid a good salary by the guild. He rarely leaves the guild house, and when he
does it is in the guise of a merchant's clerk (often accompanied by a
guildmember who has a cover identity as a merchant).
<P></P>
<B>Marmel in Game Play:</B> Meeting Marmel is obviously easiest for guildmembers. They pay their tithes
to him (10 gp per year for an apprentice, 50 gp per level per year from others
to a maximum of 500 gp), may bring items to him to be valued, and come to him
for supplies, or even the loan of magical items. Non-guildmembers can meet him
for the sale or exchange of items, come across him at a sale of heraldic items,
in an antique shop, or even possibly for training (for thief PCs)—at a very
steep price!
<P></P>
A major role for any quartermaster is as a source of supplies. The DM can use
a quartermaster to introduce new equipment items (the guild needs cash and the
quartermaster is on a sales drive). &quot;Hot&quot; magic items (e.g., a sword with a
non-erasable and unique design feature) can be sold to the quartermaster. New
magic items could be had for sale (rarely), or exchange (more likely), or even
borrowed for a security deposit. The DM should arrange these practicalities as he
sees fit. You don't need tables of random determinations; you should use a
quartermaster to bring in pet ideas, items you think are nifty, as you want to.
Marmel has placed a <I>magic mouth</I> on each of his bags of holding, of course, so that if anyone other than him
even touches them the magic mouth will scream out, &quot;Get your paws off!.&quot; Of
course, maybe after all these years a relative of the Furyondian mage wants to
know where the apprentice who killed his uncle (say) has gone with those spell
books, and the PCs are hired to do the job. Who would expect to find him in a
thieves' guild??
<P></P>
<B>Tactical Notes:</B> Marmel is protected against undue influence. His <I>ring of immunity to enchantment</I> makes him immune to enchantment/charm spells of 4th level or below. His <I>ring of blinking</I> helps to protect him. Marmel isn't much of a fighter, and the guild will
usually have some bodyguards with him in the event of major transactions or trips
into the outside world. Marmel does not take his <I>bags of holding </I>outside the guildhouse with him!
