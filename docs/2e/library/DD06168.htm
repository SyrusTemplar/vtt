A low-level wizard who has just graduated from an academy of magic (or has
just ended his apprenticeship with a mentor) is often sent into the world to
complete a mission or quest. The mission serves as his final exam; its completion
proves to the novice's superiors that he has successfully mastered his magical
skills and is ready to take his place as a full-fledged wizard. Failure means
that the novice requires additional training.
<P></P>
There are all types of suitable missions. For instance, the novice's
superiors might ask him to journey into an uncharted jungle to retrieve the blossom of
a rare flower. They might ask him to explore the ruins of an ancient castle to
search for a long-lost spell book, or travel to a small village and drive off a
hoard of invading monsters. Since most mentors encourage their apprentice
wizards to seek help (it teaches them the importance of cooperation), the wizard
might recruit his player character companions to aid him.
