This spell can be cast in one of two ways: in a manner that affects the
priest, or in a manner that affects a subject other than the priest.
<P></P>
The first method affects only the priest and allows him to shield his true
emotions from magical examination. Thus, it can block wizard spells such as <I>ESP</I> or priest spells such as <I>emotion read</I>. While <I>emotion control</I> is in effect, anyone using one of these spells will sense the emotion
designated by the priest rather than his true emotions. When the priest casts <I>emotion control</I>, he designates the false emotion he wishes to be revealed.
<P></P>
This use of <I>emotion control</I> also gives the priest a +2 bonus to saving throws against the following
spells: <I>spook, taunt, irritation, know alignment, scare, emotion, fear</I>, and <I>phantasmal killer</I>. When any of these spells are cast on the priest, he is immediately aware of
the attempt, although he does not learn the source of the spell.
<P></P>
If another character casts <I>emotion read, ESP</I>, or a similar spell on the priest, the priest must make a saving throw vs.
spells with a +1 bonus for each 5 levels of the priest. If the priest
successfully saves, the other spellcaster reads the false emotion; if the priest fails the
saving throw, the spellcaster reads the priest's true emotion.
<P></P>
The second use of this spell allows the priest to create a single emotional
reaction in the subject(s) (similar to the wizard spell <I>emotion</I>). Some typical emotions follow, but the DM may allow other similar effects.
<P></P>
<I>Courage:</I> The subject becomes berserk, gaining +1 to attack rolls and +3 to damage, and
temporarily gaining 4 hit points (damage against the subject is deducted from
these temporary points first). The subject need never check morale, and
receives a +5 bonus to saving throws against the various forms of <I>fear</I>. Courage counters (and is countered by) <I>fea</I>r.
<P></P>
<I>Fear</I>: The subject flees from the priest for the duration of the spell, even if
this takes him out of spell range. Fear<I> </I>counters (and is countered by) courage.
<P></P>
<I>Friendship:</I> The subject reacts positively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of
a roll on the Encounter Reactions table (Table 59 in the <A HREF="DMG_DD00564.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00564.htm">DMG</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) is moved one column to the left. Thus, a threatening PC becomes cautious, an
indifferent PC becomes friendly, etc. Friendship counters (and is countered
by) hate.
<P></P>
<I>Happiness:</I> The subject experiences feelings of warmth, well-being, and confidence,
modifying all reaction rolls by +3. The subject is unlikely to attack unless
provoked. Happiness counters (and is countered by) sadness.
<P></P>
<I>Hate: </I>The subject reacts negatively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of a
roll on the Encounter Reactions table is moved one column to the right (i.e.,
a friendly PC becomes indifferent, a cautious PC becomes threatening, etc.).
Hate counters (and is countered by) friendship.
<P></P>
<I>Hope:</I> The subject's morale is improved by +2. His saving throw rolls, attack, and
damage rolls are all improved by +1 while this emotion is in effect. Hope
counters (and is countered by) hopelessness.
<P></P>
<I>Hopelessness:</I> The subject's morale suffers a -10 penalty. In addition, in the round in
which the emotion is initially established, all subjects must immediately make a
morale check. Hopelessness counters (and is countered by) hope.
<P></P>
<I>Sadness:</I> The subject feels uncontrollably glum and is prone to fits of morose
introspection. All attack rolls suffer a -1 penalty and initiative rolls suffer a +1
penalty. The subject's chance of being surprised is increased by -2. Sadness
counters (and is countered by) happiness.
<P></P>
All subjects of the second version, even willing targets, must save vs. spell
to resist the emotion. In addition to all other modifiers, the saving throw is
modified by -1 for every three levels of the priest casting the spell.
<P></P>
The material component for both versions of the spell is a small bunch of
fleece or uncarded wool that is consumed in the casting.
