Before attempting a difficult task, the priest may cast <I>call upon faith</I> to aid his performance. If the priest has been true to his faith (as
determined by the DM), the priest gains a +3 (or +15%) bonus to one die roll (his
choice) needed to complete the task. The bonus may be used to affect a saving throw,
attack roll, ability check, etc. For example, if a priest were about to cross
a narrow log high above a chasm, he could cast this spell and gain a +3 bonus
to his Dexterity ability check.

The material component is the priest's holy symbol.
