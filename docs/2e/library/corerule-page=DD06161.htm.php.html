A wizard who spends his days as a member of an adventuring party has ample
opportunity to discover treasures and earn rewards. Exceptionally talented wizards
may receive a weekly or monthly retainer from an adventuring party in addition
to a share of any treasure discovered or rewards earned. Such wizards have no
need for formal careers, assuming their services are in demand or the missions
they undertake are successful.
