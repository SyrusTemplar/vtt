<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Though rangers work well in all types of
outdoor settings, most of them have one particular environment with
which they are exceptionally familiar and feel especially
comfortable. This environment, called the <I>primary terrain</I>, may
be similar to the area where the ranger grew up, received his
training, or currently calls home. A ranger operates best in his
primary terrain, thanks to his intimate knowledge of this type of setting.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A ranger's primary terrain has no
particular function in and of itself. Rather, it's used to generate
special benefits and other variables described elsewhere in this
book. For instance, certain character kits in Chapter 4 grant bonuses
to rangers when they occupy their primary terrain. A ranger's primary
terrain also helps determine his species enemy (Chapter 2) and
followers (Chapter 3).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Types of Primary Terrain</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept of primary terrain presumes
that similar survival techniques, modes of transportation, flora and
fauna, and physical features prevail in similar environments,
regardless of where in the world they're located. Therefore, primary
terrain doesn't refer to a particular area, such as the High Moor of
the FORGOTTEN REALMS&reg; setting, but to a general category of
terrain, such as swamp or mountains. Conceivably, any combination of
geographical features and climate could serve as a primary terrain,
but for convenience, we'll confine the possibilities to nine general types:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Aquatic.</B> This terrain type
includes all areas consisting primarily of water, such as lakes,
oceans, and rivers. At the DM's discretion, this category may also
include islands and coastal regions.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Arctic. </B>This includes any region
covered with ice and snow where temperatures rarely rise above zero
degrees. The North Pole is good example of arctic terrain.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Desert.</B> This includes any barren,
flat areas covered with sand or hard-packed earth. Desert climates
are extremely dry and hot, with daytime temperatures commonly in
excess of 100 degrees, followed by much colder nights. Vegetation is
usually sparse, with special adaptations. Much of a desert may be
unsettled or unexplored.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Forest.</B> This category comprises
any woodland areas in temperate climates. At the DM's option,
subarctic and subtropical climates may also be included. Forests
abound with a variety of animal species, and vegetation flourishes.
Not surprisingly, Forest is the primary terrain of choice for the
majority of rangers.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Hill.</B> These are highlands, often
wild and rough, which may or may not be forested. They usually form
an intermediate zone between lowlands, such as Plains or Desert, and
the highest lands, which are Mountain terrain.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Jungle.</B> These are tropical lands
(including rain forests) overgrown with dense vegetation and trees,
and teeming with animal life. Such regions are often hot, humid, and
hostile to civilization.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mountain.</B> This category includes
terrain consisting of high rocky peaks, typically 4,000 feet or more
above sea level, with sparse vegetation, severe slopes, and jagged
cliffs. Subtropical to subarctic climates are typical, though a wide
range of temperatures is possible.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Plains.</B> These are flat areas with
stretches of low rolling land, including pastures, meadows, fields,
and farmlands. Grazing animals are common here. Such regions are
usually covered with grasses or scrub vegetation and are usually
temperate in climate.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Swamp.</B> This includes bogs,
marshes, and other low elevation areas with standing water or
waterlogged soil. Many species of reptiles, birds, and insects live
in these regions. Vegetation grows in abundance. The climate may be
oppressively hot and humid or cold and misty.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; An ambitious DM may wish to define these
primary terrain categories more precisely. Instead of a general
Aquatic primary terrain category, he may include both Freshwater
Aquatic and Saltwater Aquatic, or distinguish them further by
designating Temperate Freshwater Aquatic, Tropical Freshwater
Aquatic, and so on. In such cases, the DM will need to adjust the
primary terrain references elsewhere in this book; for instance,
creating his own Freshwater Aquatic Species Enemy Table like the
tables in Chapter 2.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; For most campaigns, however, the nine
categories listed above should suffice. Though obvious differences
exist, say, between saltwater and freshwater settings, a ranger's
associated skills--the ability to swim, an understanding of aquatic
ecology, a familiarity with water-breathing creatures--are applicable
to both. Hence, a ranger whose primary terrain is Aquatic is
presumably comfortable in a variety of watery environments.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Choosing a Primary Terrain</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The player chooses his ranger's primary
terrain as part of the character creation procedure, subject to the
DM's approval. Each ranger has only one primary terrain. Because the
primary terrain reflects many years, perhaps a lifetime, of exposure
to a particular environment, the primary terrain never changes. In
exceptional campaign circumstances, however, the DM may allow a
ranger to discard an old primary terrain and choose a new one; for
instance, if a ranger whose primary terrain is Forest spends a few
decades exploring the Great Glacier, his primary terrain may become
Arctic. But as a rule, the primary terrain remains constant
throughout a ranger's career.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; In most cases, the choice of the primary
terrain will be obvious, as it usually derives from the ranger's
background. It will be similar to the area where the ranger was
raised, or the region where he's spent most of his life. The primary
terrain of a ranger who grew up in the barren wastelands of the WORLD
OF GREYHAWK&reg; Sea of Dust would probably be Desert. A ranger
trained to oversee a private hunting reserve in the Wendle Wood of
the DRAGONLANCE&reg; setting would probably have Forest as his
primary terrain.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;A ranger's primary terrain can be randomly
rolled on Table 14. The results are subject to the approval of the DM.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the ranger has a primary terrain, it
can be used as a basis for developing the character's personal
history. If the primary terrain is Arctic, for example, consider how
the ranger might have become familiar with such an extreme
environment. Was he hired by a king to oversee a seal refuge?
Abandoned in the Great Glacier as a youth when his explorer parents
were killed by a polar bear? Accepted as an apprentice by a famous
white dragon hunter? Let your imagination soar!</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Optional Rule: Primary Terrain Specialization</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; As an option, a ranger may be allowed to
specialize in his primary terrain. This confers a +2 bonus when
tracking in that terrain, a +2 bonus when training animals from that
terrain, general a +2 bonus on any proficiency check associated with
that terrain, and an additional -2 penalty to anyone trying to track
the ranger through his primary terrain. On the other hand, the
terrain-specialized ranger has a -2 penalty in all terrains except
the one in which he is specialized. This specialization in terrain
does not cost any proficiency slots. The ranger cannot specialize in
more than one type of terrain.</FONT></P>
