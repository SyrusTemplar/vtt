In a combat or any other loud situation (such as a raucous tavern, a charging
mob, an earthquake, a hurricane, or a singing contest at a dwarven
boiler-making plant), the DM may want his PCs to make Vision and Hearing Checks in order to
see and hear certain things.
<P></P>
Certainly, when a fighter is pointed in a certain direction, there's nothing
distracting him, and an ogre is lumbering at him from that direction, the
fighter is going to see the ogre. No roll is necessary.
<P></P>
But when there's a chance that the character could fail to notice such a thing
(as defined by the DM), the character gets to make a Vision Check or a Hearing
Check (whichever the situation calls for).
<P></P>
A Vision or Hearing Check is a 1d20 roll against the character's Intelligence
or Wisdom, whichever is <I>higher</I>. If the PC rolls his ability or less, he's successfully made his check and
can see or hear whatever it is he's supposed to. If he fails, he doesn't.
<P></P>
Protective headgear, however, provides penalties to the character's Vision and
Hearing Checks, as well as providing other benefits and hindrances.
