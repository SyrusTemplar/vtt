A priest must undergo specific preparations to receive a quest spell. Isolated
prayer and meditation for 24 hours are required (double this if he has Wisdom
of only 17 or is below 12th level). If this period is interrupted, the priest
must begin anew. Following this period, the priest needs one hour to establish
and maintain a direct mental link with his deity and receive the spell into his
mind. During this communion, the priest is in a state of exultation and is
oblivious to the outside world. He cannot be roused from this reverie.
<P></P>
The DM may rule that specific ceremonies be carried out by the priest during
the time of meditation and the time of the granting of the spell. These
ceremonies should be determined in accordance with the nature of the religion. The
priest may be required to be in a major church or temple for the ceremony. The
presence of junior priests and acolytes, perhaps united in mass prayer, may also be
needed. However, these are only suggestions and should not be rigidly
enforced--a god of travelers would not require a quest spell to be granted in a temple,
for example.
