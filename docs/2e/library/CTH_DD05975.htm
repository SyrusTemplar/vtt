Many more equipment items are detailed here, which may be used by thieves
going about their business. Virtually none of these are restricted to usage by
thieves only. as before, thieves are the most likely characters to use them or to
know where to find those that are not legally available. The DM can determine
which items may be available in his campaign, how PC thieves may become aware of
them and the like, as with the previously described items.

The miscellaneous items have been grouped into various categories depending on
their main application. This is sometimes just for convenience, and some items
have several potential uses, so the list is worth perusing carefully. There is
a final catchall miscellany, preceded by a section devoted to the several uses
thieves can find for modified poles and staves!
