The<I> word of recall</I> spell takes the priest instantly back to his sanctuary when the word is
uttered. The sanctuary must be specifically designated in advance by the priest and
must be a well-known place. The actual point of arrival is a designated area no
larger than 10' x 10'. The priest can be transported any distance, from above
or below ground. Transportation by the<I> word of recall</I> spell is safe within a plane, but for each plane the priest is removed, there
is a 10% cumulative chance that the priest is irrevocably lost. The priest is
able to transport, in addition to himself, 25 pounds of weight per experience
level. Thus, a 15th-level priest could transport his person and an additional
375 pounds. This extra matter can be equipment, treasure, or even living
material, such as another person. Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail. Note
that unusually strong physical fields, such as magnetic or gravitational forces,
or even magical applications can, at the DM's option, make the use of this
spell hazardous or impossible.
