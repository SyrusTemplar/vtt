Multi-Classed Wizards
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Armed with the spells of a wizard as well as fighting ability, stealth, or
priestly magic, multi-classed wizards are powerful, flexible, and popular
characters. The great range of powers offered by a wizard-s magic serve as a potent
weapon for the character and augment the abilities of his other class. A
thief/mage with access to spells such as <I>spider climb, invisibility</I>, and <I>wraithform </I>can do things no ordinary thief could attempt. A fighter/mage with a <I>strength, stoneskin</I>, or <I>fire shield </I>spell in operation is a deadly fighting machine. And the versatility and spell
selection of a mage/cleric is truly impressive.
<P></P>
Elves, half-elves, and gnomes may be multi-classed wizards. Elves may be
fighter/mages or mage/thieves; half-elves may be fighter/mages, cleric or
druid/mages, thief/ mages, fighter/mage/clerics, or fighter/mage/thieves; and gnomes may
be fighter/illusionists, cleric/illusionists, or illusionist/thieves. Other PC
races from specific world-settings may be able to multi-class as wizards, too.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Specialist Wizards: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Under most circumstances, a multi-classed wizard must be a mage; the
single-minded study and devotion of a single magical specialty would demand the
character-s full attention. The only exception is multi-classed gnome characters, who
may be illusionists but can-t be mages.
<P></P>
However, if the DM agrees, a limited number of additional specialties may be
available to the multi-classed character. Selecting one of these optional
specializations costs a multi-classed character 20 character points under the <A HREF="SP_DD02964.htm#f6c7b94e"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="SP_DD02964.htm#f6c7b94e">Skills &amp; Powers</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>character design rules, or an experience point penalty of 20% for standard
characters. The specializations available for each PC race are shown below:

<B>Restrictions: </B>Multi-classed wizards gain the full benefits of all their classes, but must
abide by any restrictions that aren-t specifically negated by a class benefit.
For example, a wizard/priest can use more weapons than a single-classed wizard,
but is still limited to Type B weapons. The most important restriction is the
character-s inability to cast spells while wearing armor. While a multi-classed
fighter/wizard may wear any armor he chooses, the armor itself interferes with
the character-s ability to cast spells. In order to cast a spell, the character
must remove his armor. The only kinds of armor that do not interfere with
spellcasting are elven chain mail and elven plate mail. (Note that single-classed
wizards can-t use these special armors because they-re not trained in the wearing
of armor.)
<P></P>
<B>Optional powers: </B>With the DM-s permission, multi-classed wizards may select some of the
optional abilities described in <A HREF="DD03419.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03419.htm">Chapter 2</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> , including armor, automatic spell acquisition, bonus spells, casting time
reduction, no components, detect magic, dispel, enhanced casting level, extended
duration, immunity, learning bonus, range increase, read magic, research bonus,
and any restriction except reduced hit points. These can be paid for by
balancing advantages with restrictions of equal value, or the character can accept an
experience point penalty of 30% plus 1% for each point he spends on additional
abilities. For example, a wizard who chooses the read magic ability (5 points)
reduces the number of experience points he earns by 35 percent.
