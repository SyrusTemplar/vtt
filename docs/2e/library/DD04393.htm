This potent spell summons a number of animals to the priest. For each level of
the priest, a number of animals totaling 10 hit dice appear.
<P></P>
The Power who grants the spell enables the priest to know exactly what types
and numbers of animals are within the area of effect. The priest may specify the
numbers of animals he wants; for instance, a 16th-level priest could summon 60
HD of wolves, 40 HD of bears, and 60 HD of wolverines. The animals will begin
arriving in one round and will be assembled at the priest's location at the end
of three turns.
<P></P>
The animals will not fight among each other even if they are natural enemies.
Monsters (dragons, gorgons, hell hounds, etc.) cannot be summoned with this
spell.
<P></P>
The summoned animals will aid the priest in any means of which they are
capable. They will enter battle, protect the priest and his companions, or perform a
specified mission until the priest dismisses them or the spell expires. During
this time, the priest can automatically communicate with his animals.
<P></P>
At the end of the spell, the animals instinctively return to their lairs. For
the first three turns after the spell expires, the animals will not attack the
caster, his companions, or other summoned animals. After this time, the animals
will behave normally.
