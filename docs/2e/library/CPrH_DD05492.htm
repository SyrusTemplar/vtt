Priests may be limited in the types of armor they wear. Some sample
limitations:
<P></P>
<P></P>
May not wear non-metal armor
<P></P>
May not wear metal armor
<P></P>
May not wear magical armor
<P></P>
May not wear <I>any</I> armor
<P></P>
May not use shields
<P></P>
May not use certain types of shields
<P></P>
May only wear armor made by priests of the same faith
<P></P>
<P></P>
Any of these restrictions could be made for any of the four reasons given
above. If metal armor disrupts clerical magic, then it could not be worn by
priests. If the religion's philosophy forbids harm to animals, then leather armor may
be forbidden. And so on.
<P></P>
Armor restrictions don't just reflect the god's attributes or prohibitions;
they help define the combat roles of priests in the campaign. A priest who can
wear full metal armor is more likely to be a combat force in the campaign than
one who can't.
<P></P>
You can be more sure that a player who picks a priest-type which is limited to
less efficient armor is a player who wants to role-play a priest, rather than
one who merely wants to play a fighting machine who is efficient in both combat
and magic.
