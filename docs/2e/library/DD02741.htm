<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Weight: </B>This is the weapon-s weight in pounds. Some weapons have a negligible weight,
but a group of 10 weigh one pound.
<P></P>
<B>Size: </B>Weapons are described as Small, Medium, or Large. A character can employ a
weapon equal to his own size in one hand and can employ a weapon one size larger
in two hands. A size S gnome can use a dagger or short sword one-handed, but he
would need two hands to use a size M battle axe.
<P></P>
<B>Type: </B>Weapons are divided into three categories: Bludgeoning, Piercing, and
Slashing. This describes the weapon-s method of creating injuries and is used to
determine what kind of critical hits the weapon inflicts. In addition, some monsters
may be partially resistant to the effects of certain weapon types; for example,
skeletons only take 1/2 damage from slashing or piercing weapons.
<P></P>
<B>Speed: </B>Weapons are rated as <I>fast, average, </I>or <I>slow </I>for purposes of the <I>Player-s Option</I> combat system. In addition, a number is included after the category to
reflect the weapon-s speed factor under standard AD&amp;D rules. If the <I>Player-s Option</I> combat system is not being used in a campaign, the speed factors are used
instead.
<P></P>
<B>Melee Reach: </B>All hand-to-hand weapons are rated as having a reach of 1, 2, or 3 squares. A
reach of 1 allows the user to attack any target in an adjacent square that he
threatens, a range of 2 allows the user to attack targets one or two spaces
away, and so on. A weapon with a range of 3 <I>cannot </I>be used to attack a target only 1 square away; it can only attack targets 2 or
3 squares away.
<P></P>
If a weapon has a ??? in this category, it cannot be used to make melee
attacks.
<P></P>
<B>Missile ROF: </B>This is the number of times per combat round that a missile weapon may be used
to attack. Naturally, a character can-t throw two or three weapons per round
if he only has one available.
<P></P>
<B>Missile Range: </B>Range is expressed as three numbers. The first number is the outermost limit
of short range, the second is the outermost limit of medium range, and the third
is the outermost limit of long range. For example, a thrown dagger has a range
of 2/4/6. If it is thrown at a target one or two squares away, it-s a
short-range shot; a target three or four squares away is a medium-range shot; and so on.
<P></P>
Missile ranges are given in combat system squares. In normal melee scale, a
square equals 5 feet. In missile scale (only used for outdoors or open
battlefields) a square equals 5 yards.
<P></P>
<B>Damage: </B>Damage is divided into two categories: versus Small-Medium creatures, and
versus Large or larger creatures. The target size dictates which rating to use.
<P></P>
<B>Knockdown: </B>The knockdown die is rolled any time the weapon scores a hit. A result of 7 or
better creates a possible knockdown against a Man-sized target.
