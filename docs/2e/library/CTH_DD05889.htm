As usual, this covers a range of options. There may be a facade of one
organization, whereas behind the scenes a quite different organization presides. It
may seem that anarchy rules among the thieves of one town, but many are secretly
organized behind the scenes. Or, a guild might seem to be centralist whereas in
fact local leaders are hiding much of their activity from others, so that the
guild is in reality fractionated. A complex situation could exist whereby the
guild looks centralist at first sight, then looks fractionated (as above), and
then is seen to be part of each (a couple of the strongest local leaders are
secretly allied to carve up more territory while other leaders are fractionated)â€”a
really complex option. Ample scope for DMs to develop intrigues and onion-skin
puzzles here!
