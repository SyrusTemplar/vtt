<P></P>
How can the DM put all this together? Let’s consider a couple of the AD&amp;D
campaign settings as examples. First of all, take a look at Faerun, the setting of
the Forgotten Realms® campaign. Magic is quite common in the Realms, and only
slightly mysterious; everyone knows of the great wizards and the typical powers
a wizard is likely to command, but there are a number of unique spells and
magical items to be found. Magic is also fairly powerful in Faerun and comes with
little cost or sacrifice to any character who works hard enough. The magic of
the Realms is about average for an AD&amp;D campaign.
<P></P>
The Dark Sun® campaign has an entirely different approach to magic. Magic is
still fairly common and mysterious, but it can be extremely powerful (the
sorcerer-kings of Athas command 10th-level magic) and comes at a great cost—the
defiling of any living vegetation nearby when a wizard casts a spell. In fact, the
destruction caused by Athas’ wizards is the chief cause of the planet’s
dessication and the rise of bizarre, mutated monsters.
<P></P>
Last but not least, the Birthright™ campaign setting
<P></P>
portrays a world in which wizard magic is rare. Mages are mysterious figures
with unusual powers. Only a handful of characters have the heritage required to
make use of true magic, and fewer still can command the kingdom-shaking powers
of realm magic.
<P></P>
Here are a few ideas for alternative magic settings for your own campaign:
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>The College of Sorcerers: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">In this setting, all wizards belong to a single guild or society cloaked in
rite and mystery. (The imagers of Stephen R. Donaldson’s <I>The Mirror of Her Dreams </I>are a good example of such a society.) Spells may require a rare or unusual
ingredient controlled by the College, or the College may treat spells as secrets
that must be kept at any cost.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Secrets Man Was Not Meant to Know: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Wizard magic is the province of horrible pre-human powers of the Outer Void,
and dealing with them is the worst kind of betrayal. Insanity plagues those
foolish enough to delve into the secrets of these elder powers; H.P. Lovecraft’s
stories are an excellent model of this kind of campaign. <A HREF="DD03506.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03506.htm">Chapter 6</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> describes a spell point system of magic that reflects this type of setting.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Smoke and Mirrors:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Wizards are far less powerful than they appear to be—most are nothing more
than alchemists and scholars who can command a few feeble spells. Any spell that
creates something out of nothing or summons energy where no energy existed
before cannot be cast; illusions, divinations, and minor alterations and summonings
are the only types of magic that work. Many magical effects are accomplished
through nonmagical means; for example, a <I>pyrotechnics</I> spell is nothing more than a handful of chemical powder thrown on a flame.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>The Magical Renaissance:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> In this world, almost everyone has a magical talent or two. Magic is fully
integrated into society, not as a replacement for technology, but as a part of
the common awareness and an augmentation of a person’s skills. Chambermaids use <I>cantrips</I> to dust and to make beds, royal investigators have access to <I>speak with dead </I>and <I>ESP</I> to enforce the law, and many brilliant works of art are at least partly
magical in nature. Even nonwizards may have a small selection of spells in this kind
of setting.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>The Lost Powers: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Priests of this campaign have almost no spell powers. The various deities of
their pantheon have lost the ability to grant spells to their followers or have
denied their followers spells for some reason. For a particularly chilling
campaign, combine this thesis with the <B>Secrets Man Was Not Meant to Know </B>scenario to create a world in which the only spellcasters with any power are
the insane servants of inhuman powers.
