Although they share similar abilities and philosophies, no two rangers are
quite alike. But how do you make one different from another?
<P></P>
   This chapter offers a convenient solution in the form of <I>character kits</I>. Character kits are structured collections of proficiencies, traits,
benefits, and limitations that help define different rangers as unique individuals. A
kit can serve as a basis for a ranger's personality, background, and role in a
campaign.
<P></P>
   Character kits are entirely optional--ranger characters can get along without
them just fine. But they're a lot of fun, adding color and depth to a campaign,
as well as making rangers more interesting to play. We'll take a look at a
number of kits in detail, and explain how to use them. We'll also give some tips
on designing new kits from scratch.
