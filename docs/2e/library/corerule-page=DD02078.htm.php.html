When the wizard employs this spell, he causes an object to vanish (i.e., to be
teleported as if by a <I>teleport</I> spell) if it weighs no more than 50 pounds per caster level. Thus, a
14th-level caster can vanish, and cause to reappear at a desired location, an object up
to 700 pounds in weight. The maximum volume of material that can be affected
is 3 cubic feet per level of experience. Thus, both weight and volume limit the
spell. An object that exceeds either limitation is unaffected and the spell
fails.
<P></P>
If desired, a vanished object can be placed deep within the Ethereal Plane. In
this case, the point from which the object vanished remains faintly magical
until the item is retrieved. A successful <I>dispel magic</I> spell cast on the point will bring the vanished item back from the Ethereal
Plane. Note that creatures and magical forces cannot be made to vanish.
<P></P>
There is a 1% chance that a vanished item will be disintegrated instead. There
is also a 1% chance that a creature from the Ethereal Plane is able to gain
access to the Prime Material Plane through the vanished item's connection.
