<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weather Sense:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This proficiency enables the character to make intelligent guesses about
upcoming weather conditions. A successful proficiency check means the character has
correctly guessed the general weather conditions in the next six hours. A
failed check means the character read the signs wrong and forecast the weather
incorrectly. The DM should roll the check secretly. A proficiency check can be made
once every six hours. However, for every six hours of observation, the
character gains a +1 bonus to his ability score (as he watches the weather change, the
character gets a better sense of what is coming). This modifier is cumulative,
although sleep or other activity that occupies the attention of the character
for a long period negates any accumulated bonus.

Sometimes impending weather conditions are so obvious that no proficiency
check is required. It is difficult not to notice the tornado funnel tearing across
the plain or the mass of dark clouds on the horizon obviously headed the
character's way. In these cases, the player should be able to deduce what is about to
happen to his character anyway.
