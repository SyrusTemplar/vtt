At the culmination of this dreadful spell, the wizard screams like a banshee
(a groaning spirit). For each level of the caster, one listener within 30 feet
hears the wail. Those who fail a saving throw vs. death magic die instantly.
<P></P>
The wizard cannot be the victim of his own spell, nor can he choose who will
be affected. If there are more potential victims than the level of the caster,
the DM must randomly determine which creatures are affected. Creatures who
cannot hear (due to ear plugs, deafness, etc.) can be targets, but cannot be
affected and are considered to automatically make their saving throws.
<P></P>
The material component is a lock of hair from an evil female elf.
