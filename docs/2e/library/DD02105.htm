By casting this spell, the wizard opens a channel between the plane he is in
and the Negative Energy plane, becoming the conductor between the two planes. As
soon as he touches (equal to a hit if melee is involved) any living creature,
the victim loses two levels (as if struck by a spectre). A monster loses 2 Hit
Dice permanently, both for hit points and attack ability. A character loses
levels, Hit Dice, hit points, and abilities permanently (until regained through
adventuring, if applicable).
<P></P>
The material component of this spell is essence of spectre or vampire dust.
Preparation requires mere moments; the material component is then cast forth,
and, upon touching the victim, the wizard speaks the triggering word, causing the
spell to take effect instantly.
<P></P>
The spell remains effective for only a single round. Humans or humanoids
brought below zero energy levels by this spell can be animated as juju zombies under
the control of the caster.
<P></P>
The caster always has a 5% (1 in 20) chance to be affected by the dust, losing
one point of Constitution at the same time as the victim is drained. When the
number of Constitution points lost equals the caster's original Constitution
ability score, the caster dies and becomes a shade.
