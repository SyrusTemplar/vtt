spell level, plus 1,000-10,000 gp for a laboratory). Following is an alternate
way to establish research costs.
<P></P>
There are two categories of expenses required for research: the Basic
Investment, and the Operational Cost.
<P></P>
The Basic Investment is a one-time expenditure, representing the funds spent
to buy the scrolls and books needed, as well as the funds necessary to assemble
a suitable laboratory.
<P></P>
The library costs for each spell level are summarized in Table 15. There are
two ways a wizard can avoid the Basic Investment for a library.
<P></P>
1. The wizard already has a suitable library of his own (see the <A HREF="DD06232.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD06232.htm">Wizard's Library</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> section below).
<P></P>
2. The wizard has access to a large library, such as those existing in major
cities or in academies of magic. (The DM decides if a library of acceptable size
is available to the wizard).
<P></P>
<P></P>
The Basic Investment for a laboratory is 1,000-6,000 (1d6 x 1000) gp. The DM
determines the cost of the laboratory, either by rolling randomly or setting a
specific price. As with the library, there are two ways a wizard can avoid
paying the Basic Investment for a laboratory:
<P></P>
1. The wizard has purchased a laboratory previously. Once a wizard purchases a
lab, it becomes a permanent part of his possessions. He never has to buy
another one unless, of course, it blew up in a lab accident or is otherwise
destroyed.
<P></P>
2. The wizard has access to a laboratory in a major city or at a magical
academy. A city or academy that has a suitable library will usually have a suitable
laboratory, but the decision belongs to the DM. The DM might also require the
wizard to pay a modest weekly rental fee--say, 20-120 (2d6 x 10) gp--for the use
of the lab.
<P></P>
<P></P>
The Operational Cost is an ongoing expense necessary to sustain the research.
The Operational Cost must be paid every week and mainly represents the price of
additional books, supplies, and scrolls. The weekly Operational Cost is equal
to 200-1,200 (2d6 x 100) gp. The DM determines the Operational Cost, either by
rolling randomly or choosing a fixed price. There is no way for a wizard to
avoid paying the weekly Operational Cost
