The Location
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> When a wizard is contemplating the construction of a laboratory, the first
thing he will want to consider is the location of the lab. If the wizard travels
extensively, like many adventurers do, the choice of his laboratory-s location
may prove to be a difficult decision. Since the character will be investing a
vast amount of money in the construction and outfitting of his laboratory, he
will want to make certain that the facility is located in a secure and reasonably
accessible location. There-s a lot of valuable and irreplaceable material in a
laboratory, and most wizards dread the thought of some hooligan sacking their
workshops.
<P></P>
Many wizards locate their laboratories in or near major cities. There are
several advantages to this strategy: first of all, the wizard has easy access to
skilled craftsmen for unusual pieces of equipment; second, the large cities
attract traders dealing in the rare or unusual, making it easier for the wizard to
locate some material components; third, resources such as libraries and fellow
wizards or alchemists may be close at hand; and last, cities are relatively
secure from monstrous incursions. On the down side, cities also host large and
well-organized thieves? guilds, and many wizards find themselves forced to pay
protection money to keep their labs intact. Also, a wizard who lives near a large
population center is generally easy to find, and the character-s enemies won-t
have any problem in tracking him to his base of operations.
<P></P>
Because of these risks, some wizards prefer to conceal their laboratories in
unpopulated or inaccessible regions. The wizard loses the benefits of close
contact with civilization, but gains a degree of privacy that an urban wizard finds
impossible. This can be costly, especially when the wizard needs some smithing
or glassblowing work done, and there-s no one nearby who can do it. A
wilderness base generally costs 20%?50% or (1d4+1) x 10% more to equip and maintain
than a comparable lab in the city. Note that remoteness doesn-t guarantee safety;
instead of thieves, a wizard in the wilderness has to worry about monsters of
all sizes and inclinations nosing around the premises!
