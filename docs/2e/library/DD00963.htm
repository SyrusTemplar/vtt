<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Helm of Brilliance:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">When discovered, a <I>helm of brilliance</I> appears to be nothing more than an ordinary piece of armor for head
protection-a helmet, bassinet, mallet, etc. of iron or steel. When worn, it functions
only upon the utterance of a special command word. When so empowered the true
nature of the helm is visible to all. The helm is armor of +2 value. It is of
brilliant silver and polished steel, and set with 10 diamonds, 20 rubies, 30 fire
opals, and 40 opals-each of large size and magicked-which perform as explained
below. When struck by bright light, the helm will scintillate and send forth
reflective rays in all directions from its crown-like, gem-tipped spikes. The
jewels' functions are:

Each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. The helm may be used once
per round. The level of the spell is doubled to obtain the level at which the
spell was cast with respect to range, duration, and such considerations. Until
all of its jewels are magically expended, a <I>helm of brilliance</I> also has the following magical properties when activated.
<P></P>
1. It glows with a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. This light causes
<P></P>
pain and 1d6 points of damage to all such creatures except skeletons and
<P></P>
zombies.
<P></P>
2. The wearer may command any sword he wields to become a <I>sword of flame.</I>
<P></P>
This is in addition to any other special properties it may have. This takes
one
<P></P>
round to take effect.
<P></P>
3. The wearer is protected as if a double-strength <I>fire resistance ring</I> were worn,
<P></P>
but this protection cannot be augmented by further magical means.
<P></P>
4. The wearer may produce flame as a 5th-level cleric.
<P></P>
Once all of its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses all of its
powers. The gems turn to worthless powder when this occurs. Removing a jewel destroys
the gem. They may not be recharged.
<P></P>
If a creature wearing the helm is attacked by magical fire and fails to save
vs. magical fire, he must attempt another saving throw for the helmet without
magical additions. If this is failed, the remaining gems on the helm overload and
detonate, inflicting on the wearer whatever accumulated effects the gems would
normally have.
