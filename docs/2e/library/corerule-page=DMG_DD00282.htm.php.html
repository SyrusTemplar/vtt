Unconscious change happens when the character's actions are suited to a
different alignment without the player realizing it. As in the case of a deliberate
alignment change, the DM must keep track of the character's actions. If the DM
suspects that the player believes his character is acting within his alignment,
the DM should warn the player that his character's alignment is coming into
question. An unconscious alignment change should not surprise the player--not
completely, anyway.
