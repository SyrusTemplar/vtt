Bards often associate with one another, especially those who hold similar
views and practice similar forms of entertainment. If such a group becomes
established, it is known as a college. Colleges are to bards what guilds are to most
other characters. These are places in which skills, philosophies, beliefs, and
talents are pooled together. However, colleges are too unique to be given the
generic label of &quot;guild.&quot;
<P></P>
Membership in most guilds is a permanent matter or at least a long-term one.
If a thief joins the local thieves' guild, he is likely going to remain there
until something drastic happens. This is not so with bards joining bard colleges.
<P></P>
Bards float from one college to the next. When they are visiting a particular
city or village, they look up the local college and partake in its functions.
Then when the bard's mood changes, he parts with that college and proceeds on
his merry way. Colleges serve as a form of specialty inn-members come and stay
for a while, then move on.
<P></P>
From one month to the next, the entire membership of a given college can
change. As would be expected, this demands that bard colleges be set up in a very
loose format. Most colleges have a set of rules posted in some easily accessible
location (often just inside the entry way). These rules are amended, repealed,
and redrafted as often as membership turnover causes a shift in philosophy.
<P></P>
The functions of a college are determined by the current members. Most
meetings are called on an informal basis; those who show up partake in the discussion,
practice, or seminar. Such meetings can evolve into a regular event (for a
short while), fragment into smaller groups, or simply end in lieu of more exciting
events.
<P></P>
Authority is treated as is everything else-in a very nonchalant way. If the
current ranking member of the college is a neutral evil bard, authority is
determined by age, power, and underhanded tricks. If a lawful neutral bard is in
control, authority is governed strictly by a set of written laws and proceedings.
Of course, as one leader departs the college and another comes into power, the
rules and methods of determining authority are likely to change. A common saying
among bards is, &quot;If you don't like the way a college is run, wait a minute and
it'll change.&quot;
