The halfling Bandit is a far cry from his or her human or orcish counterpart.
While the basic approach to thievery is the same, he or she pulls off robberies
with more panache. The target is confronted with a choice: hand over your
goods or suffer bodily harm--yet the halfling Bandit always retains a certain
amount of sympathy for his or her victims and will never bully someone simply for
the pleasure of it.
<P></P>
Bandits tend to work in small groups, though not all thieves in the band need
be members of this kit--or even halflings. They will have a headquarters in
some remote location, almost always screened by forest (including forested
swampland). Trails to the lair are well hidden, and if the entire band is composed of
halflings it's likely that in many places these access paths will pass under
low-hanging branches, through close and thorny thickets, and even under stone
arches only 2' to 3' tall. Depending on the size of the Bandit band, one or two
lookouts will probably be on duty at all times along the most-traveled of these
obscure paths.
<P></P>
A Bandit PC should have a Charisma of at least 12 and a Strength or
Constitution of at least 13.
<P></P>
Roads to Adventure: Some halflings become bandits because they want to put a
healthy distance between themselves and the nearest authorities; others choose
this profession for the fun of the thing. For example, a halfling who stands up
to a local duke's rapacious tax collector and drives him out of the village
will probably want to consider a very long vacation as soon as she calms down.
Once she has fled to the woods, established a hideout, and made a reputation for
herself by harassing more of the human lord's agents, other halflings may flock
to her banner--some because they believe in her cause, some because the
lifestyle appeals to them.
<P></P>
The Bandit has a curious standing in halfling society--officially he or she is
disapproved of, and the local Sheriff will often send the area's ruler long
reports lamenting his or her inability to stop the holdups. Privately, the same
Sheriff might be a friend of the Bandit leader--indeed, he or she may have
relatives belonging to the band--and remain content to leave them alone so long as
they avoid violence and don't rob members of their own race. Most of their
fellow halflings will regard them with amused tolerance, shading to frank envy and
hero-worship by the young and young-at-heart. A local Bandit gang might trade
occasionally with halfling villagers in the surrounding area. In this way, the
Bandits can maintain most of the comforts of the hearth and burrow and also have
the benefit of a job where they don't have to work too hard.
<P></P>
Consequently, young halflings from these neighboring villages become
acquainted with the Bandits, and at least a few of them are drawn to that apparently
idyllic forest life--and thus the ranks of the band are replenished. Others who
have become fugitives through the same causes as the original Bandit can find
safe haven and join the cause; many of them may choose to remain even after the
original injustice is eventually rectified.
<P></P>
Sometimes an entire halfling community is driven to banditry--as when a human
lord forces halflings from their homes to make way for human setters, or when
wars and invasion sweep across the land. In such cases, Bandits have been known
to become the backbone of the halfling defense, harassing enemies and
supporting friends until the crisis passes. It's memories of times like these that
explain the forgiving attitude of the typical halfling toward these carefree rogues.
<P></P>
Role: Bandits consider themselves equalizers of wealth. After all, a quick
look around will show that some folks have just too much money--and the Bandit
takes it upon himself or herself to correct this inequity.
<P></P>
Halfling Bandits will avoid violence, in so far as they can while still
accomplishing their objectives. They will not use violent ambush (such as an arrow
barrage) to halt a merchant party, for example--though nets and pit traps are
popular tactics. Utilizing the halfling ability to conceal themselves in
underbrush, Bandits delight in suddenly appearing around a daydreaming trader and his or
her bodyguards. By the time the victims can react, it's usually too late.
Often, one or more halflings skilled in Rope Use will lurk ahead and behind the
ambush, ready to lasso any of the intended victims who might make an aggressive
move or a break for freedom.
<P></P>
Those victims who have the good sense to quietly surrender will be politely
relieved of the better part of their wealth and allowed to go their way. Those
who put up a fight will be subjected to a certain amount of indignity--the better
to teach them to behave next time, according to the Bandit's admittedly
convoluted version of justice. For example, Bandits traditionally will leave a victim
his or her horses and wagons (if any) and enough of his or her goods or money
to get started again in the next town. Indeed, a very believable tale of
hardship (&quot;What! <I>All</I> of you are orphans? Poor fellows!&quot;) might possibly succeed in causing the
Bandit to let the poor unfortunate(s) pass unmolested!
<P></P>
However, a target who chooses to be &quot;difficult&quot; and is nonetheless captured
will be treated much more severely. His or her mount will be taken, along with
all his or her goods; the unfortunate victim will be left to make his or her way
back to town on foot, probably having been relieved of even his or her outer
garments!
<P></P>
Secondary Skills: Forester is a useful secondary skill to the Bandit; however,
any secondary skill is acceptable.
<P></P>
Weapon Proficiencies: The Bandit should be proficient in the short bow or hand
crossbow, as well as at least one melee weapon.
<P></P>
Bonus Nonweapon Proficiencies: The Bandit can claim one of the following as a
bonus nonweapon proficiency: Direction Sense, Fishing, Rope Use, or Disguise.
<P></P>
Recommended Nonweapon Proficiencies: In addition to those listed above,
Swimming, Weather Sense, Forgery, Set Snares, and Tightrope Walking can all prove
useful to a bandit.
<P></P>
Thieving Skill Emphasis: Any.
<P></P>
Equipment: Bandits can equip themselves in whatever fashion they choose
(within reason).
<P></P>
Special Benefits: The Bandit usually enjoys a considerable amount of support
from the halflings in the local population (&quot;local&quot; being within about three or
four days' travel of the bandit lair). This typically translates into advance
warning of any attempt to seek out and destroy the lair by militia, men-at-arms,
or hired parties of adventurers.
<P></P>
Special Hindrances: There's always the chance that the Bandits will pick on
the wrong victim--a powerful wizard who only looks like a plump merchant, or an
arrogant young lord or lady who determines to have revenge at all costs. In the
latter case, the full weight of the local ruler, whether king, duchess, or
baron, could well be thrown into an effort to root out the Bandit lair.
