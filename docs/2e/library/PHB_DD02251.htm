This spell summons an invisible aerial servant to find and bring back an
object or creature described to it by the priest. Unlike an elemental, an aerial
servant cannot be commanded to fight for the caster. When it is summoned, the
priest must have cast a<I> protection from evil</I> spell, be within a protective circle, or have a special item used to control
the aerial servant. Otherwise, it attempts to slay its summoner and return from
whence it came.
<P></P>
The object or creature to be brought must be such as to allow the aerial
servant to physically bring it to the priest (an aerial servant can carry at least
1,000 pounds). If prevented, for any reason, from completing the assigned duty,
the aerial servant returns to its own plane whenever the spell lapses, its duty
is fulfilled, it is dispelled, the priest releases it, or the priest is slain.
The spell lasts for a maximum of one day for each level of experience of the
priest who cast it.
<P></P>
If the creature to be fetched cannot detect invisible objects, the aerial
servant attacks, automatically gaining surprise. If the creature involved can
detect invisible objects, it still suffers a -2 penalty to all surprise rolls caused
by the aerial servant. Each round of combat, the aerial servant must roll to
attack. When a hit is scored, the aerial servant has grabbed the item or
creature it was sent for.
<P></P>
A creature with a Strength rating is allowed an evasion roll, equal to twice
its [pi]bend bars[xpi] chance, to escape the hold. If the creature in question
does not have a Strength rating, roll 1d8 for each Hit Die the aerial servant
and the creature grabbed have. The higher total is the stronger.
<P></P>
Once seized, the creature cannot free itself by Strength or Dexterity and is
flown to the priest forthwith.
