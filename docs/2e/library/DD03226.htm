<TITLE>Harness Subconscious-- Psionicist Nonweapon Proficiency (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Harness Subconscious:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Through the use of this proficiency, a psionicist temporarily boosts his PSP
total. To procure these extra PSPs, the psionicist's PSP total must be at its
maximum. Two full days (48 consecutive hours) must be spent gathering energy
from subconscious reserves. At the end of this time, the psionicist makes a
proficiency check. Success increases his PSP total by 20%, rounded up.
<P></P>
The extra PSPs remain available for 72 hours or until they are used up,
whichever comes first. At the end of 72 hours, the psionicist loses as many PSPs as
he gained from his current total (though the total won-t drop below 0).
<P></P>
During the 72 hours of boosted energy, the psionicist can-t recover PSPs if
his current total equals or exceeds his usual maximum. Once all of the bonus PSPs
have been used, PSPs can be recovered normally up to the usual maximum.
