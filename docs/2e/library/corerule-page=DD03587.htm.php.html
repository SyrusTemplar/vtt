Cold-based attacks are rarer than fire-based attacks but are still fairly
common among wizard spells. The most obvious examples are <I>ice storm, cone of cold, </I>and <I>Otiluke’s freezing sphere</I>.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Visibility: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The supernatural temperatures of a cold-based spell can cause some
surprisingly thick fog by condensing water vapor in the air. The more humid the setting,
the more likely it is for cold-based attacks to leave a residue of fog.
Generally, cold spells create a cloud of fog equal in size to the spell’s area of
effect. The fog persists for 1d6 rounds, and any attacks in or through the mist
suffer a –2 attack penalty.

on the ground; in fact, the <I>ice storm </I>spell specializes in this effect. Creatures moving in the area of effect have
a 25% chance of risking a slip or fall, which a saving throw vs. death magic
(or a Dexterity check, DM’s choice) can avert. Note that this is not as dangerous
as the sleet application of <I>ice storm </I>since that version of the spell is designed to coat the ground with slippery
ice.
<P></P>
Objects subjected to intense cold may be weakened or become unusually brittle
for a short time afterwards. Even if an item passes the saving throw, for the
next 1d6 rounds it is especially vulnerable to normal blows or crushing blows,
suffering a –4 penalty on any further item saving throws.
<P></P>
As noted under fires, metal or stone objects subjected to supernaturally cold
temperatures may be affected as if struck by a <I>chill metal </I>spell.
