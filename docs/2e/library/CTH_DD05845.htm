Depending on the individual guild, the thief may have other responsibilities.
These can vary considerably, but some of the more common cases are detailed
here.
<P></P>
<I>Training</I>: The thief may only be allowed to train apprentices of his own with the
knowledge and permission of the guild, and the guild will probably want a cut of the
training fee. Some guilds will regulate the allocating of apprentices to
trainers. In busy times when the guild is expanding, middling-level thieves may have
to give up a certain amount of time, demanded by the guild, to train new
apprentices.
<P></P>
<I>Legwork: </I>Especially with apprentices and low-level thieves, the guild may require them
to do some of the tedious day-to-day legwork, at least as backup reserves. This
can involve collecting money from the victims of protection rackets,
collecting and carrying bags of small change from illegal street gambling, acting as a
messenger boy, keeping a part-watch on a warehouse, and so on. This shouldn't be
too oppressive, but a sudden need for extra help on the part of the guild is a
nice plot device for keeping a thief PC in town and maybe having him see
things, and meet people, that widen the scope of his future adventuring.
