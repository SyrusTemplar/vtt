<P></P>
This is a god of riches and wealth. He may be a god of rich treasures from
under the ground, or of riches of herds, or of any sort of prosperity.
<P></P>
The god's priests spend a lot of time dabbling in trade and teaching the
children of noble families how to manage their money wisely, to build businesses
from the ground up, to improve their communities through the careful, studied
application of money. They are not priests of greed and avarice, though the
occasional priest will end up being a greedy man.
<P></P>
The god of prosperity is male.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Community,
Peace, Race (Halfling), and Trade.
<P></P>
<B>Alignment:</B> The deity is good; at the DM's discretion, he may be chaotic good, neutral

good alignment.

<P></P>
<B>Powers:</B> <I>Detection</I> (as per the Designing Faiths chapter) of treasure and objects of value; the
priest can detect treasure when he is within 10' of it, even when it is
concealed (5' if it is behind a thin wall, or 2' if it is behind a heavy wall or
buried); however, he cannot divine its direction through this power, and must move
around to get a fix on the treasure. The power does not tell him what sort of
treasure it is, and even if it's of a type he does not desire (such as a small bag
of coins) it will alert him to the treasure's presence. The power is next to
useless when the character is among allies (their coin-pouches will set it off),
so he must walk alone to be able to use it. <I>Determine approximate depth underground </I>on 1-3 on 1d6 (same as Dwarf ability; dwarf-priests and gnome-priests of this
faith succeed on a 1-5 on 1d6).
<P></P>
<B>Followers and Strongholds:</B> The followers are received at 8th level, and consist of one fifth-level
priest, two third-level priests, and four first-level priests of the same order,
plus one fifth-level fighter (bodyguard), one fifth-level bard (the priest's
personal bard), and ten Normal Men and Women (good-looking, high-charisma men and
women with no perceivable skills or source of income who are attracted to the
priests of fortune and luck). The priest may take the following on adventures: Two
priests, the fighter, the bard, and all the Normal Men and Women. The
priesthood will pay for half of the cost of stronghold construction at 8th level.
<P></P>
<B>Possible Symbols:</B> Bull, Chest.
<P></P>
<B>Notes:</B> The weapons chosen for this priesthood were chosen based on association with
the earth, as the source of precious metals, and those which can grab, capture,
harvest the bounty of the seas, etc.
