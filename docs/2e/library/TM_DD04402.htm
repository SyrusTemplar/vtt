By use of this spectacular spell, the priest rearranges the extradimensional
and spatial geometries of the molecules of one or more creatures. The result is
that the rearrangement of the target creature causes it to implode (collapse
inward upon itself) or invert (its insides become its outsides and vice versa).
<P></P>
The result is usually inversion, unless the target would not be adversely
affected by this process (e.g., a slime, ooze, golem, elemental, etc.). In this
case, implosion takes place. In either case, the effect kills/destroys the target
instantaneously unless it makes a successful saving throw versus death magic at
a -4 penalty.
<P></P>
The priest can affect one creature per round with this spell. After each
round, the priest must make a Constitution check. If this fails, the priest is
overwhelmed with the effort of sustaining the spell, at which time the spell
terminates, leaving the priest fatigued (the equivalent of being stunned) for 1d4
rounds. The maximum possible duration of the spell is 3 turns.
