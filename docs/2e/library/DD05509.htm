The answers to these questions vary from faith to faith. The DM has at least
three ways to approach this:
<P></P>
(1) The followers are local people who are already worshippers of the priest's
god. When they hear that there will be a new priest of that god in their area,
they arrive and offer him their services.
<P></P>
(2) The followers already belong to another church or temple of the same
faith. When the PC announces his intent to build his own temple, his faith's
superiors send him followers and believers to help him.
<P></P>
(3) The god subtly inspires people from near and far to journey to the new
temple and offer their services to the priest.
