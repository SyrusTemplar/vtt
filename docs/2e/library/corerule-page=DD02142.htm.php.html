The priest casting this spell instills courage in the spell recipient, raising
the creature's saving throw rolls against magical <I>fear</I> attacks by +4 for one turn. If the recipient has recently (that day) failed a
saving throw against such an attack, the spell immediately grants another
saving throw, with a +4 bonus to the die roll. For every four levels of the caster,
one creature can be affected by the spell (one creature at levels 1 through 4,
two creatures at levels 5 through 8, etc.).
<P></P>
The reverse of the spell, <I>cause fear,</I> causes one creature to flee in panic at maximum movement speed away from the
caster for 1d4 rounds. A successful saving throw against the reversed effect
negates it, and any Wisdom adjustment also applies. Of course, <I>cause fear</I> can be automatically countered by <I>remove fear</I> and vice versa.
<P></P>
Neither spell has any effect on undead of any sort.
