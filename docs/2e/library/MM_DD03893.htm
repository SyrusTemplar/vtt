The galeb duhr is a curious boulder-like creature with appendages that act as
hands and feet. These intelligent beings are very large and slow-moving. They
live in rocky or mountainous areas where they can feel the earth power and
control the rocks around them.
<P></P>
A typical galeb duhr is from 8 to 12 feet tall. When not moving it looks like
part of the terrain it lives in.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Galeb duhr are fairly solitary creatures, preferring to live with a few of
their own kind, and none of any other kind, including earth elementals. When
approached, a galeb duhr is liable to avoid the encounter by disappearing into the
ground. If chased or otherwise irritated, however, a galeb duhr does not
hesitate to fight the intruder.
<P></P>
Galeb duhr can cast the following spells as 20th-level mages, once per day: <I>move earth, stone shape, passwall, transmute rock to mud</I>, and <I>wall of stone</I>. They can cast <I>stone shape</I> at will.
<P></P>
They can animate 1-2 boulders within 60 yards of them (AC 0; MV 3; HD 9; Dam
4d6) as a treant controls trees. Galeb duhr suffer double damage from cold-based
attacks and save with a -4 penalty against these attacks. They are not harmed
by lightning or normal fire, but suffer full damage from magical fire (though
they save with a +4 bonus against fire attacks).
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Galeb duhr, thought to be native to the elemental plane of Earth, are
sometimes encountered in small family groups in mountainous regions of the Prime
Material plane.
<P></P>
It is not known how (or whether) galeb duhr reproduce, but &quot;young&quot; galeb duhr
have occasionally been reported -- those specimens encountered being a smaller
size than normal.
<P></P>
While galeb duhr seem to have no visible culture above ground, they are known
to collect gems, which they find through their passwall ability. They sometimes
have small magical items in their possession, evidently taken from those who
attacked them to take their gems.
<P></P>
The “music” of the galeb duhr often provides the first evidence that these
creatures are near -- and usually the only evidence, as the unsociable galeb duhr
are quick to pass into the ground when they feel the vibrations of approaching
visitors.
<P></P>
Sitting together in groups, the galeb duhr harmonize their gravelly voices
into eldritch tunes; some sages speculate that these melodies can cause or prevent
earthquakes. Others argue that the low rumbling produced by these creatures is
a form of warning to others in the group, but there is no conclusive evidence
either way.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Galeb duhr have no natural enemies, other than those who crave the gems they
collect. Galeb duhr eat rock, preferring granite to other types, and disdaining
any sedimentary type. The rocks they eat become part of the huge creatures;
such a meal need take place only once every two or three months.
<P></P>
Besides the gems that they carry with them, galeb duhr are likely to know
where many other gems are, as well as veins of precious metals, such as gold,
silver, and platinum, though galeb duhr seem to have no interest in these minerals
for themselves. A few powerful mages have been able to bargain with the galeb
duhr for this information. This is a difficult agreement to consummate, for the
galeb duhr are valiant fighters, and usually have no difficulty in escaping from
any harm if they are inclined to do so. Further, the galeb duhr are
territorial, and would be irritated at any attempt to make use of this knowledge in their
vicinity.
<P></P>
In some strange way, galeb duhr feel responsible for the smaller rocks and
boulders around them, in much the same way that a treant feels responsible for
trees in its neighborhood. A traveler who disturbs the area near a galeb duhr does
so at his own peril.
