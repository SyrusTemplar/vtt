<I>Description:</I> Acrobats are related to bards, as both ostensibly have the profession of
entertaining others. Some would say they do this to avoid &quot;real&quot; work. And both
characters are wont to support themselves by unorthodox means when there's a slump
in their &quot;regular&quot; business.
<P></P>
Because of the physical demands of their vocation, Acrobats must have minimum
scores of 12 in Strength and 14 in Dexterity.
<P></P>
<I>Role: </I>Even Acrobats who are not inclined toward larcenous behavior are rarely looked
up to by the rest of their society. People who become Acrobats or actors often
were born into the middle class, though their status actually becomes lower.
The middle class delights most in the entertainments. The lower classes are
usually too busy struggling to survive, and may be tied to their land or profession
in the manner of serfs. The nobility and wealthy people are &quot;above&quot; the crude
entertainment of the crowd; and even if they might see a circus on occasion, it
would be socially impermissible to join it.
<P></P>
Except in unusual circumstances, then, Acrobats will come from the middle
class. A player character might be different, if a player wishes, but he will need
a plausible explanation of the situation. Because of the social disgrace, it is
likely that any entertainer from wealthy or noble class will be disowned.
<P></P>
But then, many people who seek employment as entertainers didn't leave their
previous lives out of choice, anyway. A noble-born Acrobat was probably disowned
(or worse) before he took up that profession, and might even have assumed a
new identity. Acrobats from other backgrounds may have histories, too —things to
hide, and enemies to fear. One thing they like about the circus is that nobody
presumes to remove anyone else's mask or make-up.
<P></P>
The circus may indeed get its own history. Run by a competent swindler, a
circus may make piles of money from gullible spectators. It could bring in even
more by having its own Cutpurses, who are permitted to work the crowds so long as
they give a percentage of their take to the circus management.
<P></P>
Acrobats are almost always wanderers. A small town quickly tires of its
entertainers, so they must move on to the next, where their tricks and displays may
be considered new and impressive.
<P></P>
<I>Secondary Skills:</I> Any.
<P></P>
<I>Weapon Proficiencies:</I> Acrobats may use any weapon normally permitted to thieves. Note, however,
that they will usually avoid those that are heavy and cumbersome (see &quot;<A HREF="DD05837.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD05837.htm">Equipment</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">&quot; below).
<P></P>
<I> Nonweapon Proficiencies:</I> Required: None. Recommended: Alertness, Disguise, Fast-Talking, Juggling,
Musical Instrument, Riding, Rope Use, Ventriloquism.
<P></P>
<I>Skill Progression:</I> Among the basic thieves' skills, climbing walls is the one most applicable to
the Acrobat's overt profession. Their lightness of step leads to excellence in
moving silently, so this skill also is likely to improve rapidly. Finally,
many an Acrobat supplements his circus income by picking the pockets of the
audience when he is not actually performing.
<P></P>
<I> Equipment:</I> In order to make use of their Acrobatic skills, Acrobats favor the least and
lightest equipment possible. If the optional encumbrance rules (<I>Player's Handbook</I>, <A HREF="PHB_DD01636.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01636.htm">pp. 76-79</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) are used, Acrobats should not be permitted more than light encumbrance.
Acrobats may encumber themselves more in special situations (e.g., carrying a
wounded comrade to safety, hauling a great hoard of treasure), but they will
invariably seek to divest themselves of the excess weight at the first opportunity.
<P></P>
<I>Special Benefits:</I> The abilities of jumping, tumbling, and tightrope walking are so crucial to
this kit that the Acrobat should be able to have them as special abilities even
if the DM has chosen not to use the nonweapon proficiency system. Further,
because of their intense training with these skills, Acrobats should get a bonus of
+1 whenever a proficiency check is required. This bonus is +2 if the Acrobat
is wearing no armor (and, under the optional encumbrance rules, is unencumbered).
<P></P>
<I>Special Hindrances:</I> None.
<P></P>
<I>Races:</I> The shorter races—halflings, gnomes, and particularly dwarves—often have
difficulty with Acrobatic feats, on account of their body size and build. Dwarves,
in addition, rarely have a temperament that would endear them to a circus show;
though one can easily imagine cheerful halflings and mischievous gnomes
entertaining a crowd.
<P></P>
Dwarf characters, then, ought not to take this kit. Halflings and gnomes may,
if they so desire, but they do not gain the bonuses listed under &quot;Special
Benefits&quot; for jumping and tightrope walking. (They do receive the tumbling bonus.)
