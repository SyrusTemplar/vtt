<P></P>
This spell temporarily doubles the movement cost of one region of ground.
Units allied to the priest are unaffected and movement is made at normal cost; only
enemy units suffer the penalty.
<P></P>
A variety of effects result from the spell depending on the terrain: grass
twists hinderingly around troops' ankles, swamp becomes more viscous, rocks and
gravel shift underfoot, etc.
<P></P>
The spell affects only units--that is, groups of soldiers moving in regular or
irregular formation. The spell does not affect individuals or monsters moving
and operating alone. (When using the BATTLESYSTEMâ„¢ rules, figures that
represent individual heroes are not affected by this spell.)
<P></P>
When casting this spell, the priest must have an uninterrupted line of sight
to the terrain to be affected. The priest can choose the shape of the area, up
to the maximum area of effect. This spell can create only one continuous area of <I>tanglefoot</I>. There is no way of detecting that a particular area is under the influence
of this spell simply by looking at the area. <I>Detect magic</I> will reveal that the area is magically affected.
<P></P>
The reverse of this spell, <I>selective passage</I>, cuts the movement cost of an area in half (round fractions up) for friendly
units. Again, individual heroes and creatures are not affected by this spell
(which means that advancing troops must be careful not to leave their leader
behind!).
<P></P>
The material component is a drop of molasses for tanglefoot, and a pinch of
powdered graphite for selective passage.
