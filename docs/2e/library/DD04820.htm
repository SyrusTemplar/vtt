In this campaign, the forces of evil have somehow taken control of the world.
As a result, the forces of good have been driven underground. The evil ones,
who might be orcs or some other humanoids, may have been dominant right from the
beginning of the world's history, or they may have seized power only as
recently as twenty years ago, perhaps with the aid of some powerful magical artifact.
<P></P>
The PCs play elf characters from the Wild Lands, where the good folk have been
captured. Their job, naturally, is to restore the world to the side of good.
They harry travelers and fight the heroes of the orcs. Eventually they undertake
earth-spanning quests in search of the power that will enable their side to
overthrow the orc empire's brutal regime.
<P></P>
The tone of the campaign is, naturally, rather dark. The situation might seem
somewhat hopeless initially, as the orcs are breeding the sort of adventurers
the players are used to playing themselves. But in this campaign, the players
get to see what the orcs and goblins must routinely experience in other
worlds?that is, when PCs trounce <I>them</I> in search of adventure. This should give the players a better perspective on
the adventuring life and the effects of their rampaging through the lands of
humanoids.
<P></P>
An interesting variation on this theme would be to have the elves and humans
in the Wild Lands revert to a savage bestiality, while the orcs and their allies
come to flourish in the cities. Consequently, the orcs grow ever more
civilized, learning the value of cooperation, while humans and elves begin a descent
into savage evil, fighting among themselves only for their own individual benefit.
