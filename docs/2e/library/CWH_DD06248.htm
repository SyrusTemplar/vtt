Range: 60 yards
<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>
Duration: 1 turn/level

Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: 15-foot radius

Saving Throw: Neg
<P></P>
.
<P></P>
<I>Blackmantle</I> creates a shimmering aura around all creatures within the affected area that
negates all healing and regeneration, both natural and magical. For instance, a <I>potion of healing</I> has no effect on a creature under the influence of <I>blackmantle</I>, a troll cannot regenerate lost hit points, and <I>cure light wounds</I> is useless.
<P></P>
<I>Blackmantle</I> is negated for any target creatures who make successful saving throws.
Otherwise, it persists for 1 turn per level of the caster. If the creatures are still
alive at the end of the spell's duration, any active curative forces will
operate normally; for instance, a <I>ring of regeneration</I> will resume its function. However, consuming a <I>potion of healing</I> or applying a <I>staff of curing</I> while <I>blackmantle</I> is in effect will have no affect when <I>blackmantle</I> wears off, since these types of magic work instantly. In such cases, the dose
of <I>potion of healing</I> and the charge from a <I>staff of curing</I> are not only wasted, but the aura generated by <I>blackmantle </I>actually negates the <I>potion of healing</I> or the <I>staff of curing</I>, rendering it useless. If a <I>potion of healing</I> or <I>staff of healing</I> is applied after the spell wears off, the healing magic works normally.

The material component for this spell is a small mummified animal, such as a
mouse or a toad

<I>Dead Man's Eyes</I> causes the whites of the caster's eyes to turn black and his pupils to
reshape themselves into small white skulls. The caster can affect one victim per
round, providing the victim is within 3 feet of the caster and meets his gaze.
Victims are affected as follows:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Victims with 2 Hit Dice or fewer (or victims of level 2 or lower) instantly
die. No saving throw is allowed.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Victims with 2+ to 5 Hit Dice (or victims of level 3-5) instantly die unless
they save vs. death magic at a -2 penalty. Those who succeed in their saving
throws suffer 2-12 (2d6) hit points.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Victims with 5+ Hit Dice or more (or victims of level 6 or greater) suffer
2-12 (2d6) hit points of damage unless they save vs. death magic.
<P></P>
If the caster's gaze is reflected back on him (by a mirror, calm water, etc.),
he must make a saving throw vs. spells or suffer the same effects as a 5+ Hit
Dice victim. At the end of the spell's duration, there is a 5 percent chance
that the caster will become blind for the next 5-10 (1d6 + 4 hours).
<P></P>
The material components for this spell are two eyeball-sized glass marbles.
The marbles must be the same color as the caster's eyes

Range: Touch

Casting Time: 1 round

This spell causes the body of the caster (or any single person or creature
touched by the caster) to become completely covered with dragon scales,
effectively raising the subject's Armor Class by 2 for the duration of the spell; this
modification is in addition to the subject's normal AC (for instance, if the
subject's AC is 6, <I>dragon scales</I> raises it to 4).
<P></P>
The color of the <I>dragon scales</I> is the same as that of the scale used as the spell's material component;
however, the color has no bearing on the effect of the spell. <I>Dragon scales</I> also temporarily reduces the subject's Charisma by 2 points.
<P></P>
The material component of a spell is a scale from any dragon.

This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the
caster that cannot be penetrated by magical blunt, edged, or missile weapons;
all such weapons are harmlessly deflected (missile weapons strike the sphere,
then immediately fall to the ground). However, the sphere offers no protection
against magically-created creatures (such as golems) or from creatures whose
attacks are magically based (such as the gaze of a medusa). The sphere offers no
protection against spells such as <I>magic missile</I>, or spells that simulate the effects of weapons.
<P></P>
The caster can use magical weapons from inside the sphere to attack opponents
normally. Spells can also be cast through the sphere. The sphere can be negated
by <I>dispel magic</I>.
<P></P>
The material component for this spell is a piece of a broken magical weapon.

By means of this spell, the caster causes two 10-foot-long greenish tentacles
to grow from his body. One tentacle grows on each side of the caster's body,
centered between his armpit and his thigh. The caster can use the tentacles as
normal appendages to grasp tools, use weapons, or help with climbing.
<P></P>
Each tentacle can make an attack, effectively giving the caster two extra
attacks per round; a tentacle can strike to inflict 1-6 hit points of damage, or it
can wield a sword, dagger, or other weapon (at the same ability of the
caster). The flexible tentacles can easily reach victims on any side of the caster's
body.
<P></P>
If an unarmed tentacle makes a successful strike against a victim who is
man-sized or smaller (less than 7 feet tall), it also grabs and holds the victim to
inflict an automatic 2-8 (2d4) hit points of damage in every subsequent round.
To free himself, the victim must sever the tentacle; there is no way to loosen
the grip other than severing the member, killing the caster, or negating the
spell with <I>dispel magic</I>. A tentacle is severed if it takes 10 hit points of damage; damage directed
at the tentacle has no adverse effects on the caster.
<P></P>
A caster with two intact <I>tentacles </I>adds a 40 percent bonus modifier to his climbing success rate (see <A HREF="PHB_DD01781.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01781.htm">page 122</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>, ) and adds a 20 percent modifier if he has only one intact tentacle.
<P></P>
The material component for this spell is a dried tentacle from a small octopus
