This spell enables a necromancer to copy the face of another human, demihuman,
or humanoid, either living or dead. It has no effect on undead. The wizard
gains the facial features of the chosen individual of either sex, providing the
subject lies within range and the caster can clearly see the face he or she is
trying to emulate.
<P></P>
The caster does not gain any sensory abilities (or disabilities) associated
with the new face. For example, if the caster copies a blind manâ€™s face, the
wizard still retains his or her normal sight. The caster retains his or her normal
voice, too, as well as height, bodily appearance, spells, and spell-like
abilities.
<P></P>
The<I> false face</I> serves as an effective disguise, though it radiates a magical aura of
necromancy. Spells that detect or banish illusions have no effect on this disguise;
the <I>false face</I> is not illusionary. It may be reversed with<I> dispel magic</I>.
<P></P>
The material components are a small ball of natural rubber and a small mirror,
both of which are consumed in the casting.
