At some point in the history of the gods, they probably created all living
things. (It's possible for the flora and fauna of the world to have been created
by some other factor. For example, they might have just <I>been</I> there when the great ice-cap melted. But it's a more common element of the
story that the gods created them.)
<P></P>
This creation process might have involved an accident; for instance, the
greatest god sneezed, and blew fully-formed living things all over the world.
<P></P>
More commonly, it's a deliberate process, and the gods or one particular god
methodically created all the living things known to man.
<P></P>
<P></P>
When working up this aspect of the story for his own campaign world, the DM
can use this to help define the way the gods look upon specific forms of life.
Was Man created so the gods would have something entertaining to watch? To
fulfill a higher destiny? So that his brightest and best might one day add to the
ranks of the lesser gods, or accompany the gods on one last, great battle? This
kind of decision helps define man's view of the gods and their requirements of
mankind.
<P></P>
It can also be used to define mankind's opinions on certain matters. If, for
instance, animals in general were created to serve Man, then Man might have
little regard for them, except as pets and beasts of burden. However, if each god
created one or more animals to serve as totems for the god, then Man might have
a lot more respect for certain animals.
<P></P>
If the story of creation says that one sex of the sentient races was created
subordinate to the others, then there will be a crushing social pressure to keep
that sex &quot;in its place.&quot; If the story of creation does no such thing, then any
such attitudes will be have been created by mortals and may vary from place to
place. Additionally, with the added complication of <I>several </I>sentient races around (humans, elves, dwarves, etc.), the DM can make this
decision several times and choose a different approach each time. Perhaps, on his
world, dwarves are strongly male-dominated, elves are female-dominated, and
humans are more or less equal? Any such arrangement is possible.
<P></P>
Note, however, that when one sex is oppressed, players are less likely to want
to play members of that sex. Few players want their escapism to involve this
sort of prejudice directed at them.
