This spell allows the wizard to set certain vibrations to emanate from an
object or location that tend to either repel or attract a specific type of
intelligent creature or characters of a particular alignment. The wizard must decide
which effect is desired with regard to what creature type or alignment before
beginning the spellcasting, for the components of each application differ. The
spell cannot be cast upon living creatures.
<P></P>
<I>Antipathy:</I> This spell causes the affected creature or alignment type to feel an
overpowering urge to leave the area or to not touch the affected item. If a saving
throw vs. spell is successful, the creature can stay in the area or touch the item,
but the creature will feel very uncomfortable, and a persistent itching will
cause it to suffer the loss of 1 point of Dexterity per round (for the spell's
duration), subject to a maximum loss of 4 points and a minimum Dexterity of 3.
Failure to save vs. spell forces the being to abandon the area or item, shunning
it permanently and never willingly returning to it until the spell is removed
or expires.
<P></P>
The material component for this application of the spell is a lump of alum
soaked in vinegar.
<P></P>
<I>Sympathy:</I> By casting the sympathy application of the spell, the wizard can cause a
particular type of creature or alignment of character to feel elated and pleased to
be in an area or touching or possessing an object or item. The desire to stay
in the area or touch the object is overpowering. Unless a saving throw vs.
spell is successfully rolled, the creature or character will stay or refuse to
release the object. If the saving throw is successful, the creature or character is
released from the enchantment, but a subsequent saving throw must be made 1d6
turns later. If this saving throw fails, the affected creature will return to
the area or object.
<P></P>
The material components of this spell are 1,000 gp worth of crushed pearls and
a drop of honey.
<P></P>
Note that the particular type of creature to be affected must be named
specifically--for example, red dragons, hill giants, wererats, lammasu, catoblepas,
vampires, etc. Likewise, the specific alignment must be named--for example,
chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful neutral, true neutral, etc.
<P></P>
If this spell is cast upon an area, a 10-foot cube can be enchanted for each
experience level of the caster. If an object or item is enchanted, only that
single thing can be enchanted; affected creatures or characters save vs. spell
with a -2 penalty.
