?? Becoming a paladin requires intense training, strict discipline, and total
commitment. Though most paladins acquire their skills under the auspices of their
government or church, there are no established career paths or mandatory
instructional techniques. Following are some of the most common ways to become a
paladin, along with a few kits typically associated with them.

<P></P>
?? Churches secure paladin candidates at an early age, usually 8-10 years old.
High-level clerics, trained as recruiters, quietly observe their congregations,
looking for vigorous and intelligent children from pious families. When the
recruiters agree on a potential candidate, they approach the parents and request
that they relinquish custody of their child to the church. If the parents
decline, the recruiters pass on the candidate and continue their search. While some
churches may override the parents' decision, most abide by the family's wishes,
believing that effective training is impossible without the parents' support.
<P></P>
?? If the family agrees?most do, as they consider the offer a high honor?the
child becomes a ward of the church. The candidate moves into a dormitory of a
church-operated school, frequently located in a distant, isolated region to minimize
distraction. Paladin candidates are often taught side by side with clerical
acolytes, studying religious history, and ethical philosophy along with such
fundamentals as reading, writing, and etiquette. Candidates also engage in rigorous
exercise and weapon practice.
<P></P>
?? Within a few years, the students are separated, with paladin candidates
focusing on horsemanship and combat skills, and the clerical acolytes concentrating
on spellcasting and church doctrine. Paladin candidates may also receive
advanced training in medicine, language, and other academic subjects. Somewhere
between the age of 15 and 17, depending on his progress and aptitude, a candidate is
subjected to a series of tests, ranging from oral exams to evaluate his
understanding of the paladin's ethos, to confrontations with undead opponents to
display his courage and combat skills. A candidate who passes all his tests is then
eligible to become a full paladin.
<P></P>
?? <I>Suggested Kits:</I> Divinate, Inquisitor, Medician, Votary.

?? The gods may choose a mortal to become a paladin for reasons of their own.
Alternately, a qualified mortal may petition the gods for paladin status. A
suitable candidate must meet all of the physical and mental requirements for
paladinhood, and must also demonstrate unshakable faith. Neither age nor social status
is critical, though younger candidates of underprivileged classes are generally
preferred. The gods will guide the candidate through a long series of quests
and training exercises to ensure that he develops the necessary skills. On
occasion, the gods may grant paladin powers to the candidate directly, foregoing
training of any kind.

<P></P>
<P></P>
?? Recruiters representing large monarchies are constantly on the lookout for
young paladin candidates, needed to replace retiring paladins or paladins killed
in action. The recruiters largely depend on referrals from their contacts in the
aristocracy, but also consider petitions from upper and middle class families
without formal ties to the government. Because recruits must begin their
training at an early age, candidates may be as young as five or six years old.
<P></P>
?? The recruiters thoroughly investigate the background of all potential
candidates, conducting extensive interviews with the candidates' friends and family,
and observing the candidates at work and play. Candidates must be physically
sound, emotionally stable, intuitive, and well-behaved, qualities that an
experienced recruiter can recognize even in the youngest child. For every hundred
candidates evaluated, no more than two or three make the grade.
<P></P>
?? A candidate's initial training begins at home. With supervision and support
from government tutors, the candidate learns to read and write, and receives
basic instruction in etiquette and religion. He exercises for several hours each
day, and learns to ride and care for a small horse.
<P></P>
?? At age 7 or 8, the candidate moves into the household of a nobleman, lord, or
retired paladin where his training proceeds in earnest. He perfects his riding
skills, learns to use weapons (practicing with undersized wooden replicas), and
plays chess and other simple war games that teach strategy. He attends formal
state functions to learn protocol, and is taught to respect and obey his
superiors. Occasionally he joins soldiers on routine military excursions, helping to
care for their horses and observing how they conduct themselves in the field.
<P></P>
?? In his early teenage years, the candidate becomes a full-time squire to a
practicing paladin. To mark the occasion, the candidate is sometimes awarded spurs
in the same design as the master's; the candidate's spurs are silver, the
master's are plated in gold. Under the master's supervision, the candidate learns
swordsmanship and mounted combat techniques. The master provides daily
instruction on ethics and philosophy, detailing every nuance of the paladin's ethos. He
may also send the candidate on a quest to test his character, such as plucking a
feather from a harpy or retrieving a scale from a dragon turtle.
<P></P>
?? Most importantly, the candidate accompanies his master on the battlefield and
fights at his side. Despite his inexperience, a candidate is expected to hold
to the same standards as a regular paladin, sacrificing his life if necessary to
protect his master or defend his monarch. Consequently, many candidates fail
to survive their apprenticeship. Those who persevere for three to five years are
eligible to become full paladins.
<P></P>
?? <I>Suggested Kits:</I> Chevalier, Envoy, Militarist, Squire.

<P></P>
<P></P>
?? Characters without connections to churches or governments may seek out mentors
to teach them the skills of a paladin. Suitable mentors include benevolent
sages, reclusive clerics, and elderly paladins. Most live solitary lives on the
fringes of society, free of obligations to the church or state. Many have devised
unique philosophies that substitute for formal religions. A potential student
is probably expected to learn and follow the mentor's faith, no matter how
arcane.
<P></P>
?? Because a mentor seldom accepts more than one student at a time, the neophyte
paladin benefits from individualized attention, often completing training
within four or five years. Despite its brevity, the training period is intense and
demanding, concentrating on weapon mastery, horsemanship, and ethics. The
student must also swear allegiance to the mentor's values, which duplicate the
essential components of a paladin's ethos. The mentor declares the student ready for
paladinhood when he completes a final test, which may require the student to
defeat the mentor in mock combat or fulfill a quest that the mentor himself was
never able to complete.

?? In some cultures, a lawful good child of a paladin is automatically eligible
to become a paladin himself. The child's consent is usually irrelevant; a
dutiful offspring follows his parent's wishes without much fuss. The parent oversees
the child's training, which begins in the family stronghold. The child learns
manners and discipline by tending to livestock, serving meals, and assisting the
staff. Later, the parent teaches the child to ride and wield a lance, with
supplementary instruction in swordsmanship, etiquette, and religion. He may also
enroll the child at a royal academy or church school to complete his education.
Should the parent die before the child becomes eligible for paladinhood, the
church or government assumes responsibility for continuing the child's training,
a gesture made in appreciation of the parent's lifetime of service.

<P></P>
<P></P>
?? When a candidate is ready to assume the role of a paladin, the momentous
occasion is usually marked by a formal ceremony. The administering official may be a
government representative, a church dignitary, the candidate's mentor or
parent, or an avatar of the gods. As dictated by tradition and the paladin's
preference, a ceremony may be public, held before a large audience in the town square,
or private, performed in an official's chamber or a remote outdoor locale.
Most ceremonies incorporate the paladin's Code of Ennoblement, discussed in
Chapter 3. Other details are up to the DM; he is free to adapt or modify any of the
ceremonies described below, or make up his own.
<P></P>
?? Confirmation ceremonies can also make good springboards for adventures. The DM
might consider enlivening a ceremony with one or more of the following events:
<P></P>
? The administering official fails to show up. (Has he been kidnapped or
worse?)
<P></P>
? An evil wizard stages a destructive intrusion.
<P></P>
? An old friend of the candidate makes a surprise appearance, bringing an
urgent message (an uprising in a neighboring kingdom, the discovery of an ancient
civilization).
<P></P>
? A cleric's incantation, the manipulation of an ancient artifact, or the
shadow of an eclipse opens a portal to another plane of existence.
<P></P>
?? <B>Ordainment by Dubbing:</B> The simplest confirmation ceremony requires the candidate to kneel before the
administering official, who holds a ceremonial sword over the candidate's
head. After the candidate recites his Code of Ennoblement, the official taps the
sword on the candidate's neck or shoulders, then pronounces him a paladin. The
new paladin rises, embraces the official, then quietly departs.
<P></P>
?? <B>Sacrament of the Sword:</B> On the day of the ceremony, the candidate rises before dawn and bathes in a
stream, cleansing his body and, symbolically, his spirit. He dons a white robe,
representing his piousness, tied tightly at the waste with a thin sash, a
reminder of the discomfort all agents of faith must endure. Surrounded by his
family, invited guests, and representatives of his church and government, the
candidate faces the rising sun and recites his Code of Ennoblement. The administering
official presents him with a sword made of crystal or glass, symbolizing the
fragile boundary separating good from evil. The official then slaps the new
paladin on both sides of his face or strikes a blow against his chest, an emphatic
reminder always to follow his oath.
<P></P>
<B>?? Feast Day:</B> Associated with paladins who are trained by the church, the Feast Day
ceremony begins two days before the actual confirmation. The candidate spends 48 hours
alone in a dark chapel, offering prayers to her deity and subsisting on
nothing but bread and water. At the end of this period, the administering official
opens the doors and windows to bathe the chapel in sunshine.
<P></P>
?? One by one, the candidate's teachers, family members, and guests file inside.
The candidate greets them individually, thanking them for their support during
her training. After all have arrived, the candidate takes a seat in front of
the congregation. The official gives a sermon about the significance of this
great day, then the candidate kneels before him and swears to the Code of
Ennoblement. The official touches the candidate's shoulders with a ceremonial sword and
kisses her forehead. The new paladin leaves the church to the sound of
applause, then rides through the town so that everyone can see her. The day climaxes
with a great feast, filled with songs, dances, and games.
<P></P>
?? <B>Rite of the Seven Lambs:</B> The candidate joins six paladins in an open meadow. The paladins bring seven
lambs, all of them sick or wounded through natural causes. One of the paladins,
serving as the administering official, reads prayers and leads the candidate
through his Code of Ennoblement. Each paladin then lays hands on one of the
lambs, healing it. The new paladin lays hands on the final lamb. Clippings from the
healthy lambs are placed in a cloth bag, which is given to the new paladin to
commemorate the occasion.
<P></P>
?? <B>Convocation of the Blessed Waters:</B> Prior to the ceremony, the administrating official obtains a suit of armor
from a paladin who died in battle. The official retains the helmet, then
submerges the rest of the armor into a stream or lake, symbolically imbuing the water
with the spirit of the deceased paladin. The candidate washes her ceremonial
costume in the blessed stream; a typical costume consists of a linen shirt, a
crimson or purple tunic, silk stockings, leather shoes with silver ornaments, and a
golden robe embroidered with images of eagles and lions. The candidate allows
the wet costume to dry in the sun.
<P></P>
?? On the day of the ceremony, the candidate dons the costume and meets the
official near the blessed stream. The official and the candidate stand on a velvet
carpet, surrounded by dignitaries and invited guests. After reciting the Oath of
Ennoblement, the candidate kneels and drinks from the stream. The official
presents the candidate with the helmet of the deceased paladin, completing the
ceremony. The new paladin joins her guests for a modest meal under the open sky.
