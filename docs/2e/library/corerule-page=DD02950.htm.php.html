one of a group, or pantheon, of deities. He acts in a manner appropriate to
his deity, and uses his powers and skills to help others advance the beliefs of
his religion.

All priest characters can cast spells granted them by their deity, wear many
types of armor, and use many weapons.
<P></P>
Priest spells are divided into Spheres of Influence, which mirror the
interests of the priest’s deity. A priest either has Major or Minor access to a sphere.
Major access means that a priest potentially can cast any spell in that
sphere. Minor access indicates that the priest can cast only first- through
third-level spells from that sphere. The <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02951.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02951.htm.php.html">spell progression</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> for a priest is presented below.
