* If the spell’s range varies with the caster’s level, its movement rate
increases with the increased range. For example, a <I>fireball</I> cast by a 5th-level wizard has a range of 60 yards (MV 4), but a <I>fireball </I>cast by a 15th-level wizard has a range of 160 yards (MV 5).
<P></P>
Some spells, such as <I>prismatic spray</I>, have ranges listed as 0, but areas of effect that allow them to reach
distant targets. These spells’ movement rates are a function of their areas of
effect, not their basic ranges. Spells that allow instantaneous movement or that
affect huge areas have movement rates of 5. See the <A HREF="DD01392.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01392.htm">Appendix</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> for examples.

** Also includes spells with a range of less than one yard.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Type: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A spell’s type determines what it can do and which opposing spells it must
attempt to destroy. For dueling purposes, there are five types of spells:
<P></P>
<I>Attack (A):</I> The spell’s normal function in the AD&amp;D game is to harm the target in some
way. In a duel, an attack spell is used to damage or temporarily incapacitate the
opponent. Spells such as <I>charm person, web</I>, and <I>disintegrate</I> are attack spells. An attack spell must conduct combat with any opposing
defensive spell it meets and can conduct combat with opposing leech spells (the
advantaged spellcaster decides, see below). It ignores missile and other attack
spells.
<P></P>
If an attack spell reaches the opposing spellcaster’s square, it takes effect
(see the <A HREF="DD01303.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01303.htm">Characters vs. Spells</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> section for details).
<P></P>
<I>Defense (D):</I> The spell’s normal function is to protect or fortify the recipient in some
fashion. In a duel, these spells are used to destroy attack spells before they
cross the arena. Spells such as <I>protection from evil, cure light wounds</I>, and <I>minor globe of invulnerability </I>are defense spells. A defensive spell must conduct combat with any opposing
attack spell it meets and can conduct combat with opposing leech spells. It
generally ignores missiles, but some defensive spells are specifically designed to
stop missiles (refer to the <A HREF="DD01308.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01308.htm">Special Dueling Characteristics for Spells</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) Defensive spells always ignore each other, and, upon reaching the opposing
spellcaster’s square, vanish without affecting the opponent.
<P></P>
<I>Leech (L):</I> Outside of a duel, the spell normally does not cause harm or provide a
defense. In a duel, leech spells are used to destroy other spells and to damage the
opponent. Spells such as <I>teleport, detect invisibility</I>, and<I> haste</I> are leech spells. A leech spell must conduct combat with any opposing leech
spell it meets and can conduct combat with opposing attack or defense spells. It
ignores missiles.
<P></P>
If a leech spell reaches the opposing spellcaster’s square, it inflicts 1d6
points of damage per spell level. The opponent is allowed a saving throw vs.
spell to reduce the damage by half.
<P></P>
<I>Attack/Defense (AD):</I> The spell’s normal function is to create a solid barrier or summon a
creature. In a duel, an attack/defense spell creates a barrier that most spells cannot
bypass without a battle and has the ability to inflict damage upon the
opponent. The various wall and monster summoning spells as well as <I>dispel magic</I> are attack/defense spells. An attack/defense spell must conduct combat with
any opposing defensive or attack spell it meets, and it can conduct combat with
opposing leech or missile spells, as chosen by the advantaged spellcaster (see
below).
<P></P>
If an attack/defense spell reaches the opposing spellcaster’s square, it
usually inflicts 1d6 points of damage per spell level. The opponent is allowed a
saving throw vs. spell or a spell combat roll to avoid the damage.
<P></P>
<I>Missile (M):</I> The spell creates or propels a physical or magical projectile that streaks
toward the target, inflicting damage. In a duel, a missile spell is used to
damage the opponent. Spells such as <I>fireball, magic missile,</I> and<I> flame arrow</I> are missile spells. A missile spell can conduct combat with opposing
attack/defense spells. It ignores other missile, leech, attack, and most defense spells.
<P></P>
If a missile spell reaches the opposing spellcaster’s square, it takes effect
(see the <A HREF="DD01303.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01303.htm">Characters vs. Spells</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> section for details).
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Power Rank (PR):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>The higher a spell’s power rank, the more likely it is to defeat another spell
in combat. A spell’s power rank is its level plus nine. For example, a <I>fireball</I> is a 3rd-level spell and has a PR of 12.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Movement (MV):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>A spell’s movement rate determines how quickly it moves across the arena. A
spell need not move its full rate but can never exceed its movement rate in a
single round. Most spells must move at least one space every round (unless locked
in combat with another spell). The only exception is defensive spells; a
defensive spell can remain in the caster’s space instead of moving across the arena,
but only one such spell can remain with the caster at any given time. If the
caster leaves the space, the spell stays behind.
<P></P>
A spell’s movement rate is based on its range, as shown on the <A HREF="DD01300.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01300.htm">Table 26</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Requirements for Spellcasting</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
All spellcasting during a duel is simultaneous. Spells cannot be disrupted as
they can during a normal encounter. Spellcasting is not always possible,
however.
<P></P>
To cast a spell in a duel, a character must be free from the effects of
hostile spells and not engaged in personal combat with his opponent. The character
must have the intended spell memorized and must have any required material
components in his possession. Additional components are not required, however, as the
arena itself makes up for the lack. For example, the <I>pyrotechnics </I>spell normally requires a fire source. In a dueling arena, the spell still
works.
