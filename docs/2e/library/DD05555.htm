This god is the champion of doctors, medicine and other healing functions. He
cures the sick and passes on his healing knowledge to his mortal
doctor/priests. He is the enemy of disease and injury, and no admirer of war.
<P></P>
The priesthood is devoted to healing and are not allowed by their order to
turn away a patient in need; if they can help him, they must.
<P></P>
Lesser gods of this attribute are gods of specific types of healing. One might
be a god of combat injuries, one a god who heals illnesses of the mind. The
god of childbirth could be considered a lesser god of healing.
<P></P>
Healing gods are as likely to be male as female.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Birth/Children,
Dawn, Guardianship, Light, Love, Peace, and Sun. The priests of this god
dislike the priests of Death, Disease, and Evil.

<B>Followers and Strongholds:</B> The followers are received at 7th level, and consist of three third-level

and Women, all of whom must have the Healing nonweapon proficiency, who act as
chirurgeons (doctors) and nurses. The priest may take the following on
adventures: Two priests (only one of whom may be third-level) and two Normal Men and
Women. The priesthood will pay for half of the cost of stronghold construction
at 7th level. The stronghold must act as a hospital for the nearest community,
and may turn away no patient who has suffered a life-threatening injury or
disease.
<P></P>
<B>Possible Symbols:</B> Snakes, Staff.
<P></P>
<B>Notes:</B> Priests of this order are supposed to use nondamaging weapons. However, since
the staff is their symbol, many of them end up learning how to use one as a
weapon, and the god gives his assent to this knowledge by not punishing them for
using the staff in a damaging way.
