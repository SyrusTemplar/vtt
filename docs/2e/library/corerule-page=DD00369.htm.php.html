Experience points are one measure of a character's improvement, and they
translate directly into game mechanics. However, players should also improve by
trying to play more intelligently at each session. As the players learn more about
the game, the campaign, and role-playing, this should be reflected in their
experience points. When a player thinks up a really good idea--solves a difficult
puzzle, has his character talk the group out of a tight situation, or just
finds a novel way around a problem--that's worth experience points. Players should
be encouraged to use their brains and get involved.
