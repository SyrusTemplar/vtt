</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Most characters cannot see much without light. Some night conditions (those
for the outdoors) are given in <A HREF="DD01768.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01768.htm">Table 62</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. But all of these assume some small amount of light. In totally lightless
conditions, normal vision is impossible, unless a source of light is carried by
the party.

Light sources vary in the area they affect. <A HREF="DD01770.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01770.htm">Table 63</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> gives the radius of light and burning time for the most common types of light
sources.

Of course, while a lantern or fire enables characters to see, it does have
some disadvantages. The greatest of these is that it is hard to sneak up on
someone if he can see you coming. It is hard to remain inconspicuous when you have
the only campfire on the plain, or you are carrying the only torch in the
dungeon. Furthermore, not only do creatures know you are coming, they can generally
see you before you see them (since the light source illuminates the area around
you, those outside this area can see into the area). Characters should always
bear these risks in mind.
