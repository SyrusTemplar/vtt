This spell creates a duplicate of a human, demihuman, or humanoid creature.
This clone is in most respects the duplicate of the individual, complete to the
level of experience, memories, etc. However, the duplicate really <I>is</I> the person, so if the original and a duplicate exist at the same time, each
knows of the other's existence; the original person and the clone will each
desire to do away with the other, for such an alter-ego is unbearable to both. If
one cannot destroy the other, one will go insane and destroy itself (90% likely
to be the clone), or possibly both will become mad and destroy themselves (2%
chance). These events nearly always occur within one week of the dual existence.
<P></P>
Note that the clone is the person as he existed at the time at which the flesh
was taken for the spell component, and all subsequent knowledge, experience,
etc., is totally unknown to the clone. The clone is a physical duplicate, and
possessions of the original are another matter entirely. A clone takes 2d4 months
to grow, and only after that time is dual existence established. Furthermore,
the clone has one less Constitution point than the body it was cloned from; the
cloning fails if the clone would have a Constitution of 0.
<P></P>
The material component of the spell is a small piece of the flesh from the
person to be duplicated.
<P></P>
The DM may, in addition, add other stipulations to the success of a cloning
effort, requiring that some trace of life must remain in the flesh sample, that
some means of storing and preserving the sample must be devised and maintained,
etc.
