   Moving silently enables the ranger to move with a minimum of sound, almost as
if he's walking on air. Even creatures with the sharpest ears are no more
likely to detect his presence than they are to hear a feather drop. The ability
works equally well in icy mountains, heavily wooded forests, or any other type of
wilderness terrain.
<P></P>
   Getting from place to place without being heard is only the most obvious
application of this ability. Other uses include:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Sneaking up on one or more opponents in order to surprise them.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Examining the contents of a cart or a cabinet by removing the objects one by
one, then replacing them in silence. (However, silent movement applies to the
character's actions only; therefore, this ability would not negate the sound of a
squeaking cabinet door or rusty hinge of a trunk.)
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Change armor or clothes.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Other actions the DM allows, such as restringing a bow, or cutting a slit in
the back of a tent.

   Table 8 in Chapter 1 provides the base chance for moving silently, modified by
the variables in Tables 9-11. If the ranger attempts to move silently inside a
building or in any other non-wilderness area, his modified score is halved.
Other restrictions:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> He can move no faster than 1/3 his normal movement rate when moving silently.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> He can't be observed when attempting to use this ability (moving silently
isn't of much use to a ranger who's being watched).
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> If he draws attention to himself either intentionally (speaking) or
inadvertently (sneezing), the effects of moving silently are immediately negated.
<P></P>
   The DM rolls percentile dice as soon as the ranger makes an attempt to move
silently. If the roll exceeds the ranger's move silently score, he is as likely
to be heard as any other character moving in the same terrain; snapping a twig
or kicking a pebble may draw the attention of NPCs or creatures.
<P></P>
   If the roll is less than or equal to the ranger's move silently score, he is
able to move without sound. He continues to move silently until the terrain
changes (for instance, if he enters an area of pebbles, shallow water, or dried
leaves), or he attempts a new action that affects his ease of movement (such as
carrying an unconscious companion or a large jug of sloshing water). Any such
change requires a new roll.
