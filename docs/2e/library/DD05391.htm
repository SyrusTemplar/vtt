?? Feudal tradition required newly knighted soldiers to swear allegiance to a set
of principles that embodied religious ideals and service to the king. The oath
constituted a sacred promise, securing the knight's loyalty to church and
state.
<P></P>
?? At the DM's option, a paladin may take a similar oath, swearing to a &quot;Code of
Ennoblement'' that enumerates the strictures, virtues, and edicts he is obliged
to uphold. The code defines the paladin's ethos, spelling out exactly what the
patron expects of him.
<P></P>
?? The paladin swears to a Code of Ennoblement when he begins his career, usually
as part of a formal ceremony (see the &quot;<A HREF="DD05427.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD05427.htm">Becoming a Paladin</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">&quot; section of Chapter 7 for suggestions). Typically, a monarch, church
official, or mentor administers the code; the paladin candidate repeats the words as
the official recites them. Alternately, the paladin can compose his own oath and
recite it in private, addressing his words to a deity, an ancestor's memory (&quot;I
swear on the spirit of my father&quot;) or a universal force (&quot;I pledge to the
glory of the natural world&quot;).
<P></P>
?? Because different paladins may not adhere to precisely the same
principles?they may, for instance, follow different edicts?each may swear to his own version
of the code. Alternately, the DM may standardize the code for all paladins in
the campaign. The exact wording of a code isn't important, so long as it
includes these elements:
<P></P>
?<B>? Name and homeland.</B> The paladin should state his name and where he's from. He may also mention
any notable ancestors. (&quot;I, Sharlyn of Northmoon, daughter of Princess Ahrilla,
granddaughter of Parvis the Wanderer.&quot;)
<P></P>
?? <B>Strictures.</B> At the DM's option, or the player's insistence, the code may list every one
of the paladin's strictures. However, because <I>all</I> paladins must follow <I>all</I> strictures, it's not necessary to recite them one by one. A general phrase
(&quot;I swear to uphold the sacred strictures&quot;) suffices.
<P></P>
<B>?? Fealty patron.</B> The code should indicate to whom (or what) the paladin has sworn allegiance,
as explained in the Fealty section above.
<P></P>
<B>?? Virtues.</B> The five principal virtues?fealty, courtesy, honesty, valor, and honor?should
be mentioned by name, unless the DM has a good reason for excluding one or
more of them. Add any new virtues agreed upon by the DM and the player. It's not
necessary to spell out the responsibilities of each virtue, so long as both the
player and DM have read and understand the descriptions in this chapter. Any
modifications to these descriptions should be made clear before the oath is
administered.
<P></P>
?<B>? Edicts.</B> Recite the relevant sources of edicts, not the edicts themselves. Specific
edicts may be mentioned at the player's request or the DM's option.
<P></P>
?? Ordinarily, the terms of a paladin's code never change. In extreme
circumstances?for instance, if economic hardship makes it difficult for him to keep up his
tithes?the paladin may petition his king or church for an exemption. The
paladin must seek an audience with whoever originally administered the oath (or a
suitable substitute), then plead his case.
<P></P>
?? Exemptions are rarely granted, unless new conditions make it impossible for
the paladin to remain true to his ethos (if his church has become evil, the
paladin can't be expected to continue his tithes). Officials may have severe
misgivings about a paladin who even <I>requests</I> for an exemption, and may impose a modest penalty to encourage the paladin to
stop whining and shape up. See the &quot;Minor Violations&quot; section below for
suitable penalties.

<P></P>
?? Here is a sample Code of Ennoblement to use as a template. Feel free to
embellish and customize it as you see fit.
<P></P>
<P></P>
?<I>? I, *, do hereby pledge to honor the strictures of this sacred heritage ** and
promise by my faith to be loyal to ***, maintaining my devotion against all
persons without deception or forethought. Further, I vow to promote and uphold the
principles of **** and to solemnly and faithfully follow the edicts of *****.
I take this pledge freely, without coercion or expectation of reward, sworn by
my hand on this saintly relic ****** and in blessed memory of those who have
given their lives to this noble cause.
<P></P>
</I>
<P></P>
?? * Insert the paladin's name and home (&quot;Arlon of Shallowbrook.&quot;).
<P></P>
?? ** This phrase implies allegiance to the strictures required of all paladins.
It isn't necessary to recite them by name.
<P></P>
?? *** Insert the paladin's fealty patrons. In this example, Arlon swears fealty
to his monarch and religion (&quot;King Bronman of Entland and the Holy Church of
Enlightenment.&quot;).
<P></P>
?? **** Insert the five principal virtues. (Arlon will adhere to them all, as
outlined in this chapter. Because of his strict upbringing, he'll also follow the
virtue of chastity: &quot;Fealty, courtesy, honesty, valor, honor, and chastity.&quot;)
<P></P>
?? ***** Insert the edict sources. (Arlon names his fealty patrons, and because
he's promised to obey the edicts of his parents, he also mentions his family:
&quot;My king, my church, and my family.&quot;)
<P></P>
?? ****** Some ceremonies require the paladin to place his hand on a sacred
relic, such as a holy text or the monarch's sword. If relics aren't included in the
paladin's ceremony, leave out this phrase.
