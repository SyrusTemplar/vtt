<P></P>
Wizards are most comfortable in the company of their fellow practitioners,
especially those with whom they share common interests, and often form their own
associations and organizations. A few such groups are listed below. The DM is
encouraged to design variations of these groups; for instance, a Necromancy
Syndicate, a variation of the Diviners Syndicate, might exist in a particular DM's
campaign world.
<P></P>
Each organization's description includes the following information:
<P></P>
<B>Description:</B> The purpose of the group.
<P></P>
<B>Membership:</B> The types of wizards belonging to the group.
<P></P>
<B>New Member Requirements:</B> Conditions a prospective member is expected to meet in order to join the
group. Usually, this consists of paying an entrance fee or being sponsored by a
current member.
<P></P>
<B>Annual Dues:</B> The fee that a member must pay each year to remain an active member.
<P></P>
<B>Benefits:</B> The advantages of being a member.

<P></P>
<B>Description:</B> This group consists of wizards whose primary interest is alchemical research,
particularly the research of new magical potions. The group compiles and

that such information will not be shared with outsiders. Violation of this rule

are also included.

magical item research within the last year.
<P></P>
<B>Annual Dues:</B> 20 gp
<P></P>
<B>Benefits:</B> The Brotherhood can help its members obtain hard-to-find research supplies
and laboratory equipment. They can also offer assistance to members who have
reached a dead end in their research.
<P></P>
<P></P>

acceptance of magic-users in various cities and cultures, giving special attention to
places where magic-users are routinely persecuted and imprisoned for minor
infractions of the law.

<P></P>
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Description:</B> This organization seeks to further the interests of wizards through political
pressure on local and national governments. Their methods include negotiation,
demonstrations, and one-on-one lobbying. Some factions are rumored to use
violence to underscore their messages.
<P></P>
<B>Membership:</B> All wizards are eligible.
<P></P>
<B>New Member Requirements:</B> A new member must be sponsored by a current member and pay an entrance fee of

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Foes of the Wand
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<B>Description: </B>This is an organization of purists who adamantly oppose the use of magical
wands or any other magical devices. Such devices are perceived to be a threat to
the craft of magic; only the use of spells is acceptable to the Foes of the
Wand. If a member is ever caught using a magical item, he is immediately expelled.
<P></P>
<B>Membership:</B> All wizards are eligible, but the membership is primarily composed of older
mages of higher levels.
<P></P>
<B>New Member Requirements:</B> The only requirement for a prospective member is the donation of a magical
item to the Foes. The Foes then destroy the item in a solemn ceremony, after
which the prospective member vows never to use a magical item again.
<P></P>
<B>Annual Dues:</B> None
<P></P>
<B>Benefits:</B> Once per year, each member can exchange a magical item for a spell of
comparable power. The magical item is destroyed, then the Foes allow the member to
copy one spell (of their choice, not the member's) from their spell books.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Diviners Syndicate
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<B>Description:</B> More of a business than a fraternal organization, the Diviners Syndicate
sells advice, predictions, and omen interpretations to members of the aristocracy.
Their fees are expensive, but because the syndicate pools the talents of a
sizeable number of skilled wizards, their advice and predictions are extremely
accurate.
<P></P>
<B>Membership:</B> Only diviners of eighth lever or higher are eligible.
<P></P>
<B>New Member Requirements:</B> The prospective member must pay an entrance fee of 500 gp and bring at least
one new client to the syndicate.
<P></P>
<B>Annual Dues:</B> There are no annual dues. However, to remain in good standing, a member must
spend a minimum of eight weeks per year working exclusively for the syndicate.
<P></P>
<B>Benefits:</B> Members in good standing split the syndicate's profits at the end of the
year. A member's annual share is usually 5,000-30,000 (1d6 x 5,000) gp.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Center for Monster Control</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Description:</B> This organization compiles information about magical monsters and makes this
information available to its members at no charge.
<P></P>
<B>Membership:</B> All wizards who have first-hand knowledge of magical monsters are eligible.
<P></P>
<B>New Member Requirements:</B> A new member must pay an entrance fee of 10 gp. Additionally, the prospective
member must have first-hand knowledge of a magical monster or a monster
wielding magical powers (such knowledge is usually acquired as a result of a battle).
The membership votes on whether the prospective member's knowledge is of
sufficient usefulness to the organization to allow him membership.
<P></P>
<B>Annual Dues:</B> None if the member attends all bi-monthly meetings. The member may be
assessed a fine if too many meetings are missed without good reason.
<P></P>
<B>Benefits:</B> The organization supplies information to its members about magical monsters,
including their abilities, their weaknesses, and suggested strategies for
defeating or avoiding them.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>League of Extraplanar Travelers</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Description:</B> Similar to the Center for Monster Control, this organization compiles
information about alternate planes of existence and makes this information available
to its members at no charge.
<P></P>
<B>Membership:</B> All wizards who have visited one or more alternate planes of existence are
eligible.
<P></P>
<B>New Member Requirements:</B> A new member must pay an entrance fee of 20 gp. Additionally, the prospective
member must have proof of a visit to at least one alternate plane of
existence. The membership votes on whether the prospective member's knowledge of that
plane is of sufficient usefulness to the organization to allow him membership.
<P></P>
<B>Annual Dues:</B> None if the member attends all bi-monthly meetings. A fine may be assessed if
a member misses too many meetings without good reason.
<P></P>
<B>Benefits:</B> The organization supplies information to its members about the alternate
planes, including inhabitants, physical laws, and how spell casting is affected
(the DM should consult Chapter 6 for details about magic in other planes--the
league has all of this information available to its members).
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Fellowship of Sages
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<B>Description:</B> This is an organization of sages who are expert in a wide variety of
subjects. The sages charge for their advice, giving a percentage of their fees to the
Fellowship for its upkeep.
<P></P>
<B>Membership:</B> All types of wizards belong to the fellowship, each with one or more areas of
expertise.
<P></P>
<B>New Member Requirements:</B> A prospective member must pay an entrance fee of 100 gp, plus he must have a
nonweapon proficiency in one or more of the fields of study listed on Table 61
of the <I>Dungeon Master's Guide</I>. If the wizard is a recognized authority in one of the fields of study not
available as a nonweapon proficiency in the DM's campaign, he can still be
admitted to the fellowship with the DM's permission.
<P></P>
<B>Annual Dues:</B> None. However, each member must provide 15 percent of the fees he charges for
his sage advice to the fellowship.
<P></P>
<B>Benefits:</B> As long as a member spends a minimum of eight weeks per year working
exclusively for the syndicate, he has access to the advice of the other members at no
charge. If he fails to spend the minimum of eight weeks per year, he must pay
their normal fees. Advice is given according to the rules for sages on pages
106-107 of the<I> <A HREF="DMG_DD00573.htm"></A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="DMG_DD00573.htm">DMG</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">. However, the chances listed on Table 61 (page 107 of the <I>DMG</I> ) of finding a sage in the fellowship who is expert in a given field are
doubled; for instance, there is a 20 percent chance of finding an expert in
alchemy. When using the Sage Modifiers table (Table 62 of the <A HREF="DMG_DD00577.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00577.htm">DMG</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> ), assume that a fellowship sage always has access to a complete library.
