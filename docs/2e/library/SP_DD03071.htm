<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Running:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Characters can add 1_3 their normal top speed to their movement rates for up
to 1 turn. After this, they must spend a turn resting, or 6 turns engaged in
normal activity before they can sprint again.
<P></P>
Also, characters can jog steadily, moving at twice their normal movement rates
over the course of a day. Eight hours of rest is mandatory after such a stint.
Following rest, the characters can make proficiency checks. Success means they
can run normally during the upcoming day; failure indicates they cannot use
the running ability that day.
