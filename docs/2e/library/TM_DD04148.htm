The rules which follow apply to all quest spells. The DM should avoid altering
these rules in order to use quest spells consistently and fairly.
<P></P>
<B>Components:</B> Material components are never needed for a quest spell. All quest spells use
verbal and somatic components. Since this is invariant, components are
therefore not included in the spell descriptions.
<P></P>
<B>Duration:</B> In the spell descriptions, the term &quot;day&quot; is often used. Day means &quot;until the
next dawn&quot; if the spellcaster casts the spell during daylight hours and &quot;until
the next dusk&quot; if he casts the spell during nighttime hours.
<P></P>
<B>Countering Quest Spells:</B> Most quest spells cannot be dispelled. Because of their semidivine origin,
mortal <I>dispel magic</I> spells simply do not affect them. In most cases, only other quest magic will
directly counter quest magic.
<P></P>
This also applies to attempts to counter specific elements of quest spells.
For example, certain quest spells include the effect of a <I>prayer</I> spell in the area of effect of the quest spell. Such a <I>prayer</I> effect cannot be countered by the use of a mortal <I>prayer</I> spell. The quest prayer overrides the ordinary <I>prayer</I> spell.
<P></P>
<B>Saving Throws:</B> Target creatures at whom quest spells are cast are usually allowed no saving
throws. Magical items which would normally protect them against the type of
effect (e.g., a ring of free action against a hold/paralysis effect) allow a
weakened saving throw of 18. Magic resistance functions, but at only one-half
normal. If a quest spell has multiple magical effects, magic resistance checks must
be made for each effect.
