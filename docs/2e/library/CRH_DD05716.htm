?? <B>Description:</B> The Guardian is a self-appointed protector of the wilderness. Compelled by a
strong sense of duty, he has assumed responsibility for an unsettled tract of
land, doing his utmost to maintain it in its natural state and protect its
animal occupants. Though he feels kindly towards woodsmen, elves, and others who
share his respect for nature, he has little patience for those who would exploit
the wilderness for gain or spite.
<P></P>
?? A Guardian constantly monitors the region he has sworn to protect. He
scrutinizes the activity of strangers, advises travelers, and intercepts careless
hunters. He keeps an eye out for fires, floods, and other natural disasters, and
does what he can to comfort animals in times of crisis.
<P></P>
?? <I>Domain:</I> All Guardians have a specific region that they protect. The DM should
establish the boundaries of a Guardian's domain at the beginning of his career. There
are no fixed rules for assigning domains, but in general, a 1st level
Guardian's domain shouldn't exceed a few square miles. The domain expands by several
square miles each time the Guardian increases in level. By 5th level, a Guardian's
domain might encompass a region about 20-25 miles across. By 15th level or
higher, the domain might comprise an area the size of a small country.
<P></P>
?? A Guardian's domain should correspond to his primary terrain. The domain is
typically located in an uncivilized part of the world, such as a remote mountain
range or unexplored jungle. Two or more Guardians may share an especially large
domain, but such cases are rare.
<P></P>
?? <B>Requirements:</B> Standard.
<P></P>
?? <B>Primary Terrain:</B> Forest, Hill, Jungle, Mountain, or Plains.
<P></P>
?? <B>Role:</B> A Guardian operates of his own volition, having no official sanction or
title. He carries out his custodial duties as he sees fit, taking whatever steps he
deems necessary to protect his domain. Despite his independence, he usually
maintains good working relationships with officials of bordering lands. The
relationship benefits both parties. The Guardian notifies the officials of
approaching armies or other potential threats, while the officials may provide help for
problems the Guardian can't handle alone. Though many governments would jump at
the chance to have such able warriors in their employ, Guardians resist all
such offers, and steadfastly maintain their autonomy.
<P></P>
?? An adventuring party entering a Guardian's domain has a good chance of
encountering the Guardian himself. A Guardian will usually agree to guide a party
through his domain and--presuming the party's intentions are compatible with the
Guardian's philosophy--assist them in their efforts. Though a Guardian is
reluctant to leave his domain, he may do so if presented with a compelling reason,
such as the ravaging of a pristine wilderness or a threat to the ecology in
another land.
<P></P>
?? Guardians tend to be self-sufficient, clear-headed, and conscientious. They
make excellent leaders. Though a Guardian may develop deep friendships with other
party members, he always parts company at the end of an adventure, returning
to his domain as soon as he can.

<P></P>
?? <B>Special Benefits:
<P></P>
</B>?? <I>Bonus Sphere:</I> The Guardian has miner access to the Protection sphere.
<P></P>
?? <I>Bonus Spells:</I> A Guardian can cast certain spells within the boundaries of his domain. These
are detect evil (three times per day), and bless and commune with nature (once
per week each).
<P></P>
?? <I>Revive Plants:</I> This ability enables the Guardian to revitalize any type of natural plant
life suffering from drought, disease, insect infestation, or other forms of
non-magical trauma. Dead plants can't be affected, nor can the Guardian invigorate
plants beyond their normal limits (for instance, a Guardian can't cause an apple
tree to blossom in the winter).
<P></P>
?? The process requires 8 hours and can affect a square area whose sides are 10
yards times the Guardian's level (a 5th level Guardian can revive all of the
plant life within a 50 yd. - 50 yd. square). The Guardian can use this ability
once per month.
<P></P>
?? <B>Special Hindrances:</B> If a Guardian leaves his domain for any length of time, he must make
arrangements for someone else to assume his duties. He may hire a caretaker, or assign
temporary custody of his domain to a human or demihuman follower. There are no
fixed penalties for a Guardian who fails to do this. However, should a Guardian
abandon his responsibilities for more than a few days, the gods may deny him
the use of the special benefits associated with this kit. If he's absent for
longer periods--say, a few weeks--the gods may also deny him the use of all
spells. The Guardian recovers use of his special benefits and spells as soon as he
returns to his domain.
