Tournaments are events where fighters get together to compete . . . for
prizes, to show off their abilities, etc.
<P></P>
Fighting isn't all that goes on, and fighters aren't the only ones in
attendance. Tournaments are huge social events where everyone gathers to watch,
compete, gossip, trade, bet, and sport. But fighters are the center-piece; the event
revolves around them and their deeds.
