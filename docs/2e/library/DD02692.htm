<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A pin lasts for an entire combat round. A pinned character is considered prone
and grappled. The attackers can immobilize a pinned character's limbs if their
hands are free. If the attackers are the same size or larger than the
defender, one of the defender's limbs is immobilized and useless for every attacker
with free hands in the pile. If the attackers are smaller, it takes one extra
creature per size class difference to immobilize a limb. For example, it takes one
human to hold down an orc's arm, two humans to hold down an ogre's arm, and
three humans to hold down a hill giant's arm. If the attackers are larger, they
can pin two limbs for every two size classes difference. For example, a single
ogre can pin one limb of a dwarf or two of a halfling's limbs.
<P></P>
If all the defender's limbs are immobilized for two consecutive rounds, the
attackers have the upper hand and can choose any wrestling lock effect. (Damage
from locks achieved through an overbearing pin is mostly temporary, as in all
other forms of brawling combat.) A group that achieves a lock inflicts damage
only once per round, but uses its effective group Strength score when determining
damage.
