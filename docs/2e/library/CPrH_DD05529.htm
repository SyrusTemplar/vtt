Below are the priest character classes. The description of each is arranged in
this fashion:

<P></P>
<P></P>
We start out with a quick explanation of the god's attribute. The first
paragraphs talk about what the god's goals may be, what his priest's goals will be.
<P></P>
Next, we discuss what kinds of variations there may be to his attribute.
(Example: A god of the arts may be devoted to only one specific kind of art --
painting, for instance).
<P></P>
Sometimes these variations on the god's attribute might change your opinion of
what the god's nature and alignment are. (Example: A god of death might be a
frightening Grim Reaper sort of deity, or might be a gentle god of a cheerful
sort of afterlife.)
<P></P>
We also describe the gender that gods of this attribute usually belong to.<I> This isn't a limitation for your campaign.</I> Any attribute shown below can be represented by a god or goddess, or even by
a sexless deity. However, in real-world mythologies, various godly attributes
are usually represented by one sex or the other, and so here we describe which
one that is.
<P></P>
We also talk about the other types of priests this priesthood is on especially
good terms with. (Just because a priesthood isn't mentioned here doesn't mean
that there is bad feeling between them, however.)
<P></P>
<B>Alignment:</B> This paragraph describes the usual alignment of such a god, and the alignment
choices available to his priests.
<P></P>
<B>Minimum Ability Scores:</B> This text explains what minimum ability scores (always Wisdom, and often one
other) the priest must possess to be a priest in the first place.
<P></P>
<B>Races Allowed:</B> This paragraph describes which player-character races may belong to this
priesthood.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon and Weapon Proficiencies:</B> This paragraph describes which nonweapon and weapon proficiencies a priest
must have, and which additional nonweapon proficiencies are recommended for him.
The proficiencies required of the priest must be taken from the normal
proficiency slots he starts play with; he does not receive <I>extra </I>slots with which to take these proficiencies. Also listed here are the
&quot;Nonweapon Proficiency Group Crossovers&quot; for this specific priest-class (see <A HREF="PHB_DD01539.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01539.htm">Table 38</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, <I>Player's Handbook,</I> page 55 for more on the Proficiency Group Crossovers).
<P></P>
<B>Duties of the Priest:</B> This talks about the duties typically demanded of this sort of priest. Almost
all priests are supposed to provide Guidance to the flock; generally, that
guidance is related to the god's attribute. (In other words, members of the flock
come to the priest of the god of love for questions of love, to the priest of
the god of justice on questions of revenge, etc.) All priests except for the
priests of the god of Death can perform the marriage ceremony, and this is a duty
most don't mind performing. Many priesthoods have other duties as well.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon and Armor Restrictions:</B> Here, we talk about which weapons and armor the priest can and cannot use.
Mentioned in these paragraphs are some weapons which do not appear in the <I>Player's Handbook.</I> The belaying pin, bo stick, cestus, chain, daikyu, lasso, main-gauche, net,
nunchaku, sai, shuriken, stiletto, and swords such as cutlass, katana, rapier,
sabre, and wakizashi appear in <I>The Complete Fighter's Handbook.</I> The bill, lasso, maul, net, nunchaku, and scythe appear later in this
supplement, in the &quot;Equipment&quot; chapter (note that the bill is the same as the
gaff/hook from <I>The Complete Fighter's Handbook</I>; &quot;gaff&quot; and &quot;hook&quot; are its nautical names). Of the armors mentioned, banded
mail, brigandine, bronze plate mail, chain mail, field plate, full plate, plate
mail, ring mail, scale mail, splint mail, and studded leather constitute metal
armor (not all of them are all-metal, but all of them have metal elements);
hide armor, leather armor, and padded armor constitute non-metal armor.
<P></P>
<B>Other Limitations:</B> Here, we discuss other limitations and restrictions which are typically
placed on this type of priest.
<P></P>
<B>Spheres of Influence:</B> This paragraph describes the priest's access to spells of different spheres
of influence. You'll remember from the previous chapter that priesthoods which
have Good Combat Abilities tend to get three major accesses (including All) and
two minor, that those which have Medium Combat Abilities tend to get five major
accesses (including All) and four minor, and that those which have Poor Combat
Abilities tend to get seven major accesses (including All) and six minor. In
the examples below, not all priesthoods follow those guidelines<I> exactly</I>; some have one major access to few and a couple of minor accesses to many,
for instance. But if a priesthood comes up notably short on the number of spheres
it can access, it is given extra Granted Powers.
<P></P>
<B>Powers:</B> This paragraph talks about which Granted Powers the priest receives, and when
this occurs during the course of his career. Most priesthoods have at least
one; some have several. Unless the text says otherwise, each Granted Power is
available to the priest at first experience level; some, specifically listed, will
become available at other levels.
<P></P>
<B>Followers and Strongholds:</B> Here, we talk about how many followers the priest receives, what they are,
when he receives them, and when he is allowed to build his own stronghold. We
also describe how many and which of his followers can take with him when
adventuring &quot;on the road.&quot; Normally, most of the followers are supposed to stay at the
priest's temple and operate it for him; in spite of many priest-PCs'
preferences, the priest can't just bring along all his followers with him on every
adventure. The numbers given here are for the maximum number of followers the priest
can take with him on adventures; naturally, he can always take fewer.
<P></P>
<B>Possible Symbols:</B> This is a set of recommendations for the symbols that the priesthood uses.
Usually, they're representations of the god's attribute. They are also used upon
the priesthood's Holy Symbol.
<P></P>
<B>Notes:</B> Finally, if there are any further items important to the description of this
character class, we place them in this paragraph.
<P></P>

<P></P>
Most godly attributes (Love, War, Agriculture, etc.) don't specifically say
that they are enemies of Evil. This just means that these attributes are not of
themselves distinctly opposed to Evil; some have no relationship with Evil
whatsoever (for example, Agriculture). You can assume, unless the text lists Evil
among the friends of an attribute, or says that priests of this other god can be
evil, that the priests of the other god don't care for the Philosophy of Evil.
<P></P>
We haven't included a paragraph which discusses the rights the priesthood has
in the culture. That's because we don't know what sort of culture the DM will
be placing the priesthood within. The DM determines what special rights the
priesthood has; special rights, as discussed last chapter, include Church Trial,
Coronation, Other Confirmations, Tithes, Separation from the Faith, Rule, and
being the State Religion.
<P></P>
Also, the guidelines we're providing in this chapter are based on the most
common views of these sorts of gods, priests, and races. Any campaign may have a
different view of these topics, and so the DM may change these limitations and
requirements to suit his campaign. Especially prone to re-interpretation are:
races allowed, proficiencies required or forbidden, rights, weapon and armor
restrictions, other limitations, and spheres of influence.
