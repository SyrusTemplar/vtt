Selecting Spells
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> A wizard uses his spell points to choose his arsenal of spells when he takes
the time to rest and study his spell books. Most wizards pre-select their
spells; if a wizard can memorize two 2nd-level spells, he picks two specific
2nd-level spells from his spell book (say, <I>invisibility </I>and <I>wizard lock</I>) and stores them in his mind. This is referred to as a <I>fixed magick</I>; once chosen, these spells cannot be changed until the wizard casts them and
then studies his spell books again.
<P></P>
Some of the <A HREF="DD03518.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03518.htm">systems of magic</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> described later in this chapter allow a wizard to designate <I>free magicks</I>. A free magick is one which the wizard does not place a specific spell into.
By keeping the magick open, the wizard can use it to cast any spell of the
appropriate level that he has in his spell books. For example, a 3rd-level
specialist wizard might spend his spell points to acquire one fixed 2nd-level magick
within his specialization (<I>invisibility</I>, for instance) and one free 2nd-level magick (see <A HREF="DD03510.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03510.htm">Table 18</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> : Spell Cost by Level (Wizard) for spell costs). With the free magick, the
wizard can cast any 2nd-level spell in his book when he needs it. If the wizard
found himself in a situation where he needed to probe someone’s thoughts, he
could use <I>ESP</I>; if he needed to aid a friend involved in a fight, he could use <I>strength</I>; or, if he needed to distract some pursuers, he could use <I>improved phantasmal force</I>. As long as the spell is known to the wizard and recorded in his spell books,
it’s available through a free magick.
<P></P>
Obviously, this is a huge advantage for a wizard. Instead of guessing about
which of his spells may be useful in a particular adventure, the wizard can have <I>all </I>of his spells of that level accessible. However, free magicks are less
efficient than fixed magicks and cost more spell points to fill. Once the free magick
has been used to cast a spell, it is wiped from the wizard’s memory, just like
a fixed magick.

<I> Argyth, a 6th-level mage, has a total of 55 spell points with which to
purchase his spell selection. He expects heavy combat against tough opponents in the
coming adventure. For 10 points apiece, he chooses three fixed 3rd-level
spells—fireball, </I>lightning bolt<I>, and </I>haste<I>. Since he doesn’t know which of his 2nd-level spells may be most useful, he
spends 12 more points to acquire a single free 2nd-level magick, which can be
used to cast any of his 2nd-level spells. He has 13 points left over and decides
to memorize two </I>magic missiles<I>,</I> one protection from evil<I>, and one free magick </I>cantrip<I>. Argyth has spent his 55 points. He has one less 1st-level and 2nd-level
spell than he would using <A HREF="PHB_DD01471.htm"></A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="PHB_DD01471.htm">Table 21</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I> from the </I>PHB<I>, but he has an extra 3rd-level spell and the ability to call upon any
2nd-level spell and cantrip he knows once each.

Tierwen is a 3rd-level invoker. She has 15 points available for general
selections, plus 10 more points for spells of the school of invocation and evocation.
She decides to select web and magic missile for her bonus spells, using up all
10 spell points. For her normal allocation, she chooses </I>jump, light<I>, and </I>stinking cloud<I>, totalling 14 spell points. She has 1 point left over and has purchased
exactly what a 3rd-level invoker would normally receive—three 1st-level spells and
two 2nd-level spells.
