The falchion is a sword with a single-edged, heavy blade. The blade's back is
usually straight, while the edge has a curve. The blade also broadens close to
the tip, which gives the blade a cleaver-like appearance and increases the
damage inflicted. The sword is heavy, which also contributes to a fearsome cutting
blow.
