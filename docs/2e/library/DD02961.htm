<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Specialist Wizards
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Specialist wizards, such as illusionists, are those who choose to concentrate
their studies on one particular magic school. The 12 schools of magic are:
Abjuration, Alchemy, Alteration, Conjuration/Summoning, Divination,
Enchantment/Charm, Geometry, Illusion, Invocation/Evocation, Necromancy, Shadow and Song. (In
addition, the <A HREF="TM_DD04133.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="TM_DD04133.htm">Tome of Magic</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> describes elemental wizards and wild mages.) For each school of magic, there
is an opposition school or schools. Specialist wizards can never cast any
spells from as opposing school. The chart that details all the requirements,
opposition schools, races eligible for each specialization, and minimum ability scores
follows.
<P></P>
All specialist wizards (illusionists, enchanters, and so on) gain 30 character
points to buy skills. The skills below cost 5 to 15 points each. Any remaining
points can be spent on nonweapon proficiencies or saved for use during the
game.

<A NAME="d096cf5b"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Access to schools:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> A specialist wizard automatically has access to all schools of magic that are
not specifically noted as opposition schools for his specialty. (Note that
spells from opposition schools that happen to be included in alternate schools
such as song magic, alchemy, or elemental magic are still not available to the
specialist. Wild magic is available only to wild mages.)

<A NAME="e3387891"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Automatic spells (5):</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Each time the specialist wizard is able to learn a new level of spells, he

check).

<A NAME="adfa9abf"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Bonus spells (10): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Specialist wizards gain one additional spell per spell level. The extra spell
taken must belong to the wizard’s school of specialization. For example, a 5th
level mage can cast four 1st level spells, two 2nd level spells, and one 3rd
level spell. But a 5th level specialist wizard can cast five 1st level spells,
three 2nd level spells, and two 3rd level spells—provided the added spells are
from his chosen school.

rather than 12 rounds.
