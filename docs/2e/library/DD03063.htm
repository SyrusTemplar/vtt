Proficient characters will not get lost as long as they can either see the sky or
have the use of a compass. This means that they can maintain track of a given
direction, keeping themselves and their companions traveling in a straight line.
<P></P>
Characters who possess a map and can track their direction of travel can
arrive at specific points-towns, ferry crossings, bridges, monuments, wells,
springs, etc.-without proficiency checks.
<P></P>
If the map is slightly erroneous, or lacking in crucial details, the
characters will have to make successful proficiency checks to accurately arrive at a
specific point. This check can be modified for increased difficulty based on poor
weather or major problems with the map.
