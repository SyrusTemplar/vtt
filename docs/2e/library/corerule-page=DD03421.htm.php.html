<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> While the general definitions of the spheres have remained the same for <I>Player’s Option: Spells &amp; Magic</I>, a number of spells have been rearranged for purposes of game balance. Many
spells have been added to the sphere of all in order to provide all priests with
the basic spell powers that should be available to them. Some other spells
have been assigned to different schools to better define the roles and strengths
of clerics, druids, and other specialty priests. For example, <I>reflecting pool </I>was originally designed as a druid spell, but in AD&amp;D 2nd Edition it became a
divination spell available to clerics. In this book, <I>reflecting pool </I>has been placed in the sphere of elemental water, where druids have access to
it but clerics do not.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cleric Sphere Access: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As part of the reorganization of the spheres of access, clerics lose access to
the sphere of sun and the elemental spheres of air and fire. Clerics retain
minor access to the elemental spheres of water and earth. The cleric only loses a
dozen or so spells he formerly had access to, and most of these were spells
that had previously belonged to the druid in the original AD&amp;D.

access to the sphere of sun. Again, this takes away spells that blur the line
between the druid and cleric’s spellcasting powers, while restoring a number of
spells that druids formerly had access to in the original AD&amp;D game.
