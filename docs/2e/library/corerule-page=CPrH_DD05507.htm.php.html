At a certain level, priests receive<I> followers </I>and <I>believers </I>, men and women of the same faith who serve the priests.
<P></P>
To receive their followers and believers, priests must achieve a certain
experience level (8th or above, with 9th as the most common level). Soon after (the
same experience level or during the next-higher level), the priests must assume
the duties of a church leader by building a church or temple (whatever is
appropriate to the faith) and ministering over a specific geographic area. At that
time, their followers begin showing up, and arrive over a period of several
weeks.
