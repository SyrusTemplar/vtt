This represents the immediacy of an enemy threat and influences what actions
the character can choose for that combat round. A character’s options are

In addition to governing the character’s choice of combat actions for the
round, threatening is also important because it determines who is subject to what
are known as <I>attacks of opportunity </I>(<A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02391.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02391.htm.php.html">see below</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">).
