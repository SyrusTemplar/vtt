Trolls are horrid carnivores found in all climes, from arctic wastelands to
tropical jungles. Most creatures avoid these beasts, since trolls know no fear
and attack unceasingly when hungry. Their frame appears thin and frail, but
trolls possess surprising strength. Their arms and legs are long and ungainly. The
legs end in great three-toed feet, the arms in wide, powerful hands with
sharpened claws. The trolls' rubbery hide is colored a moss green, mottled green and
gray, or putrid gray. A writhing hairlike mass grows out of their skulls and is
usually greenish black or iron gray in color. Their dull, sunken black eyes
possess 90-foot infravision. Females are easily distinguished from males; they are
both larger and more powerful than their male counterparts.
<P></P>
Trolls walk upright but hunched forward with sagging shoulders. The trolls'
gait is uneven and, when running, the arms dangle free and drag along the ground.
For all this seeming awkwardness, trolls are very agile. They are masterful
climbers and can scale even sheer cliffs with an 80% chance of success. Trolls
have a poor hearing, but their sense of smell is superior.
<P></P>
Trolls have no language of their own, using &quot;trollspeak&quot;, a guttural mishmash
of common, giant, goblin, orc, and hobgoblin. Trollspeak is highly transient
and trolls from one area are only 25% likely to be able to communicate with
trolls from another.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Trolls attack with two clawed hands and their bite, and they can attack at
multiple opponents. In the rare case that a troll wields a weapon, it attacks with
a +8 damage bonus. Trolls regenerate at an amazing rate. Starting three rounds
after first blood, the creatures recovers 3 hit points per round until healed.
Trolls reduced to 0 or fewer hit points fall to the ground, incapacitated but
not slain. Incapacitated trolls continue to regenerate and stand up to fight as
soon as they have a positive number of hit points.
<P></P>
When using an edged weapon, it is possible to sever the thin limbs of a troll
(a natural 20 with an edged weapon is needed). Severed limbs continue to fight
after separation from the body (hands squeeze, heads bite if stepped on, etc.).
Attacks by severed limbs are at normal chances to hit. Separated limbs fight
for the remainder of the battle, then scuttle back and rebind with the body once
the battle is over. Limbs unable to reach the body to die within 24 hours, but
this is of little consequence since trolls regenerate lost body parts
(including the head) within a week. If a troll is dismembered and scattered, the
largest surviving piece regenerates. The others die within one day if they cannot
rejoin that piece. Only fire and acid cause permanent damage to trolls. These
forms of attack destroy its regenerative ability. A troll reduced to 0 or fewer hit
points and immersed in acid or burned with fire is killed.
<P></P>
Trolls have no fear of death, and launch themselves into combat, flailing
wildly at their opponents and biting whoever comes closest. They occasionally (25%)
throw stones before closing with their victims. Thrown stones have a maximum
range of 20 yards, weigh 10 to 20 pounds, and inflict 1d8 points of damage. If
confronted by a large natural or magical fire, trolls try to find some way
around the flames. Trolls combine a ravenous appetite with limited intelligence, so
they are frequently distracted and break off pursuit 50% of the time to pick up
food dropped by fleeing prey.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Trolls can survive in all climes, but prefer dense forests and subterranean
locales, since bright sunlight hurts their eyes; trolls suffer no combat
penalties because of this. They usually make their lairs in caves, using great boulders
to block the entrances. Inside a troll cave are a number of rough nests made
of straw and grass, plus scattered bones and treasure from victims. If there are
no caves in an area, trolls dig themselves a trollhole and cover its opening
with twigs and leaves. Trollholes are usually built near trees and are 90%
undetectable. Anyone who steps on a trollhole is 75% likely to fall through the
leafy door and tumble into the den below.
<P></P>
Trolls live in small packs of 3 to 12 trolls led by a dominant female who acts
as shaman/chieftain. She casts priest spells at 7th level; spheres typically
include Charm, Divination, Sun (Darkness only), and Weather. Leadership is only
retained by combat, so fights for pack control are frequent. Often trolls rend
each other limb from limb, but these battles are never fatal. Still, it is the
custom of trolls to toss the loser's head a great distance from the fight
scene, and frequently losers must sit and stew for a week until their new head grows
in.
<P></P>
The pack chieftain's duties are few. She leads the trolls on nightly forages,
loping along, sniffing the air for prey. If a scent is found, the trolls
charge, racing to get there first, and letting out a great cry once prey is spotted.
In return for being the hunt leader, the shaman gets her choice of mates in the
pack. Females give birth to a single troll about once every five years.
<P></P>
Trolls have ravenous appetites, devouring everything from simple grubs to
bears and humans. Their lairs are often located near human settlements or along
well traveled roads, but not too near, for even trolls respect organized
resistance by fire-bearing humans. Wandering trolls, in search of a new lair, travel by
night and sleep by day. Ravenous from walking, these packs, on occasion, attack
and devour entire humanoid villages.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Trolls prey on all but the most powerful of creatures. They respect and fear
dragons, but they hate giants of good alignment and wage war with them
frequently. The troll's green blood is used to manufacture both poison antidotes and
healing potions. The blood from one troll, worth 400 gp, can make three such
potions.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Giant Two Headed Troll
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">These ferocious troll/ettin crossbreeds posses a mottled greenish brown skin
tone, and their dress is usually moth-eaten rags or animal skins. Two-headed
trolls use trollspeak as their language. Though part ettin, these monsters retain
many of the abilities of trolls. They regenerate like trolls, but only 1 hit
point a round, and severed limbs cannot reattach (their thicker limbs are not
cleaved on a roll of 20). Two-headed trolls attack with two claws and two bites.
Both bite attacks are against one opponent, but the claws may be directed
against different foes. The troll can, though rarely, wield a weapon with a +6 damage
bonus. Like ettins, two-headed trolls are surprised only on a 1. These
creatures live in damp, underground caverns and can be found leading groups of their
smaller troll cousins.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Freshwater Troll (Scrag)
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">These gilled trolls, also called scrags or river trolls, are the most
loathsome of all the trolls. River trolls, as their name implies, travel the waterways
in search of victims. Their arms are thin and frail but their mouths are wide
and lined with dozens of needle-sharp fangs. Their color ranges from blue-green
to olive. Scrags have all of the abilities of normal trolls, but they only
regenerate when immersed in fresh water. Scrags can survive out of water for one
hour and often come ashore in search of prey. River trolls devour anything they
catch, but prefer humanoids and have a fondness for dwarves.
<P></P>
Scrags are devious hunters and often carry a few baubles with them. They lay
gems near the water's edge and wait for someone to spot them and reach down.
Other traps include burying themselves in the sand, in shallow water, and waiting
to be stepped on or tangling the rudders of small boats. River trolls
occasionally nest beneath bridges or near ferry boats, demanding a toll in exchange for
passage. The toll varies, but averages the equivalent of one cow per week, per
troll. Livestock and children frequently disappear when river trolls are near.
Scrag shamans also have access to Elemental (water) spells.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Saltwater Troll (Marine Scrag)
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Like freshwater scrags, marine scrags can breathe air for one hour and have
all of the abilities of normal trolls, except they regenerate only when immersed
in saltwater. Large, green, and pot-bellied, marine scrags are thick-skinned
and heavily scaled. Limp hair, the color of seaweed, hangs down to their
shoulders. Their feet are wide and webbed to aid them in swimming. While their limbs
are shorter and weaker than those of ordinary trolls, their mouths are larger and
filled with hundreds of needle-sharp teeth. Marine scrags can subsist on fish
and shellfish, but crave human flesh. They create their lairs in shallow ocean
caves or beneath city docks. They emerge from their caves at night, climbing
over ship railings in search of sailors or hunting the piers for a strolling
couple or a lone drunk. Their attacks are quick and stealthy; they usually hunt in
packs of four to six, but occasionally, several dozen may attack a large ship.
Marine scrag shamans also have access to Elemental (water) spells.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Desert Trolls
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Desert trolls are usually tan, but can modify their color from bleached tan to
mottled rock brown, causing a -2 penalty to opponents' surprise rolls. Their
keen senses and animal cunning reduce their chances of being surprised to
1-in-10. Like normal trolls, the desert variety usually attacks with two claws and a
bite.
<P></P>
Desert trolls are immune to normal fire, heat, and cold. They do not
regenerate acid damage, damage from magical fire, or fire breath weapons. In addition,
they suffer damage from normal water that cannot be regenerated. Normal water
inflicts 1d4 points of damage per vial, 2d4 points per flask, and 4d4 points per
skin. A <I>decanter of endless water</I> aimed directly at a desert troll (successful attack roll required) causes 25
points of damage per round. Purified water (including normal and holy water)
causes double damage. A <I>potion of sweet water</I> causes 6d6 points of damage and the troll must make a saving throw vs. poison
or die.
<P></P>
These trolls are tougher and more tenacious than their more common
counterparts, but they are also more solitary. They skulk at the edges of settled areas,
waylaying travelers and polluting sources of pure water.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Spectral Troll (Troll Wraith)
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Spectral trolls, taking material form only in darkness, are tormented by the
memory of life. They try to slay all living creatures they encounter. Resembling
normal trolls in all respects except color, their jet black skin and hair make
them easily distinguishable from other trolls. Spectral
<P></P>
trolls have the same attacks as regular trolls and can divide them among many
opponents. A silver or magical weapon is needed to attack them, making the
final disposition of a spectral troll an even trickier prospect.

Being undead, spectral trolls can be turned by priests as though they were
specters. It is noted that a humanoid slain by a spectral troll becomes one itself
in three days, unless a proper burial ceremony is performed by a priest of the
victim's religion. Spectral trolls vanish in direct sunlight. They do not take
damage from sunlight, they merely fade from view and reappear at the same spot
at nightfall. Even those captured, unconscious, or trapped in <I>temporal stasis</I> have escaped permanent imprisonment in this manner.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Giant Trolls
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Giant Trolls are hideous hill giant/troll crossbreeds. They resemble normal
trolls in all respects, except for their unnatural size. Their skin is reddish
brown and they have red-rimmed eyes.
<P></P>
Despite their pot-bellied appearance, giant trolls are immensely strong and
inflict damage like a hill giant when they are using their favorite weapon of
attack -- a large spiked club made from a tree trunk or a house timber. These
clubs cause 2d6+7 points of damage. In those rare instances when a giant troll has
no weapons, its claws inflict 1d6+1 points of damage; as with all trolls, the
claw attacks can be divided among different opponents as necessary.
<P></P>
Instead of using their claws to attack, weaponless giant trolls are more
likely to grab medium-sized prey in their large hands and wield the struggling
victim like a club, beating a new target with the body. Refer to the rules on <A HREF="DMG_DD00383.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00383.htm">hand-to-hand</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> combat in the <I>Dungeon Masters Guide</I> for guidelines.
<P></P>
Giant trolls who are overwhelmed by many small- and medium-sized opponents
take time to grab and hurl the warriors into nearby trees, leaving more time to
deal with the softer, weaker enemies. Note that, like hill giants, giant trolls
can catch missiles 25% of the time, if in reach, and can hurl boulders that
cause 2d8 points of damage.
<P></P>
Unlike normal trolls and their closer relatives, giant trolls never attack
with their bite. This is due to the fact that they are much taller than the meals
they like best (humanoids, of course), and they find it difficult to bend
forward with the flexibility normal trolls enjoy.Then too, the head of a giant
troll, more than any other part of the cross-breed anatomy, is almost identical to
that of a hill giant, except that their skin is reddish brown. The giant troll
also lacks the razor sharp teeth of normal trolls that strike fear in so many.
<P></P>
Giant trolls regenerate damage as normal trolls, but at the rate of 2 hit
points per round. They cannot reattach severed limbs. Before a giant troll can be
killed, at least 10 points of damage must be inflicted on it by fire. If this
condition is not met, and the giant troll is reduced to a single hit point,
further damage has no effect, except to prevent regeneration.
<P></P>
They have a very acute sense of smell and 90-foot infravision. Giant trolls
are feared throughout the world, for not only do they possess the horrible
ability to regenerate damage inflicted upon them, but they also possess the power and
strength of hill giants (fearsome in their own right). The combination is a
deadly one, and, even worse, giant trolls travel in loose tribal bands of 1dl2
members. They are rarely encountered alone. Lairs of giant trolls are always
served by 2d6 normal trolls who act as simple lackeys (and sometimes food) for
their larger cousins.
<P></P>
Giant trolls are found in nearly every clime. Giant trolls are on good terms
with strong hill giant tribes, for which they serve as elite personal guardians
for the ruling chief.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ice Troll
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The ice troll is a smaller, more intelligent relative of the normal troll, and
is probably the result of magical experimentation. It closely resembles its
more common cousin, but has semitransparent, very cold skin. Ice trolls are
famous for being cunning, evil creatures which keep humans and demi-humans as
livestock. Because ice trolls need water to regenerate, they never leave their lakes
and rivers, and will create elaborate traps to lure their prey to them.
<P></P>
Ice trolls are organized and intelligent enough to know their weaknesses, and
rarely start a fight at a disadvantage. Unlike their larger and less
intelligent cousins, they do not wade into combat blindly, but will try to pick off
weaker opponents one by one, hoping to bring back live prey. Ice trolls generally
attack with claws for 1d8 hit points of damage each, but have been known to use
weapons on rare occasions (10%), at an additional +4 to each weapon's damage due
to Strength. Attacks may be directed against different opponents.
<P></P>
The regenerative powers of ice trolls are not as great as normal trolls. An
ice troll must be immersed in water to be able to regenerate 2 hit points per
melee round. The creatures often make their stand in a shallow pool of water to
keep this advantage.
<P></P>
Because of the thin, brittle nature of the ice troll, it is possible to sever
one of the creature's limbs with an edged weapon, on a natural attack roll of
20 with an edged weapon. Severed limbs also regenerate 2 hit points per turn, as
long as they are immersed in water. If a severed limb is not in contact with
water, it will move up to 30 feet in search of water, always moving toward it,
if it is in range.
<P></P>
Fire and acid are the only attack forms which negate the ice troll's ability
to regenerate.
<P></P>
Because of the ice troll's physiology, fire-based attacks do double damage.
Ice trolls are unaffected by cold or cold-based spells, and because of their
magical nature, can only be hit by magical weapons or missiles.
<P></P>
Ice trolls live in groups of 7-12 in arctic and sub-arctic regions, near open
water. Because they are smaller and less resilient than their larger cousins,
they have developed a higher sense of cooperation to stay alive. Each group has
a leader, usually the most intelligent. Leaders are responsible for keeping the
group safe and well-fed.
<P></P>
Ice trolls live near settled regions, hoping to waylay and capture humans and
demi-humans. Ice trolls will frequently bait traps for adventurers, using
treasure they have salvaged from previously waylaid groups. Settlements also provide
more common livestock, which, although less preferable than human flesh, is
considered edible in times of need. Ice trolls establish their lairs near lakes
or rivers. Here the ice trolls will have gathered all their treasure, as well as
5-20 human or demi-human captives. These prisoners are kept well-fed on grains
and vegetables, so that the ice trolls need never go too long without food.
<P></P>
Ice trolls mate in the spring and give birth to one baby ice troll in the late
fall. When an ice troll tribe gets too large, it splits, one group wandering
off to find a new lair. Ice trolls that live in arctic regions often hunt
remorhaz, and will even pick off a solitary frost giant. Ice troll blood is
frequently used in the manufacture of<I> frost brand swords</I>, and<I> rings of cold resistance</I>.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Spirit Trolls
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The spirit troll is an odious mutation of the spectral troll. Several schools
of thought completely separate this creature from the spectral variety,
presenting evidence that the spirit troll is a perverted magical interbreeding of
trolls and invisible stalkers. The spirit troll is invisible; characters able to
see invisible objects observe it to be very similar to a troll, slightly shorter
and with diffused features. The spirit troll can only be hit by magical
weapons. Fire inflicts full damage, but it is invulnerable to cold-based attacks. It
regenerates as does a troll, and at the same rate.
<P></P>
It attacks with its fangs and two sharp claws, against three different
opponents if it so desired. The damage inflicted by its fangs (2d4+2) is normal
damage, except that the spirit troll adds the damage to its own hit points -- in
effect healing itself! The damage inflicted by the spirit troll's claws (1d4+2) is
taken not only from the victim's hit points but also from Strength. Strength
points lost in this way are recovered in 2d4 turns. If a character's Strength is
reduced to 0, the PC dies. If the Strength is reduced to 1 or 2 points, the PC
is rendered comatose, only recovering when (and if) sufficient hit points are
recovered to raise the Strength to 3 or more. The spirit troll has an acute
sense of smell and superior, 120 foot-range, infravision.
