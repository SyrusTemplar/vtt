A character’s choice of combat action governs how far he can move in a given
combat round. For example, a wizard certainly can’t move a considerable
distance, picking his way through swinging weapons and uneven footing, while attempting
to cast a spell, which requires great concentration and precision. Likewise, a
warrior cannot safely withdraw from a fight merely by turning and walking away
at normal speed. Certain kinds of actions naturally preclude movement, while
other choices are actually more effective when larger distances are crossed.
Some choices allow for a range of movment options.

The various combat actions fit into three basic movement categories. These
categories include no-move actions, half-move actions, and full-move actions. Some
of the combat actions listed above may fit into only one category, while
others may function with two or even all three types of movement.
