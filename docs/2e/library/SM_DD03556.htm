Proposing a Spell
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Player characters can research four types of spells: existing spells that they
just haven-t had the opportunity to learn, -look-alike? spells that
approximate an existing spell that they failed to learn; spells that would exceed the
normal maximum number of spells allowed by a character's Intelligence score; and
completely new spells never before seen in the campaign. Note that priests never
have to worry about conducting the first three types of research, since they
can use any spell belonging to a sphere to which they have access. Priests only
conduct spell research to create entirely new spells.

valuable spell that eludes their grasp. There's no reason that a wizard can-t
decide to research a <I>fireball</I> or <I>magic jar </I>if he gets tired of waiting for an old spell book or scroll to fall into his
lap. This is fairly straightforward, since the spell description already exists;
the PC can go on to <A HREF="DD03559.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03559.htm">Conducting Research</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> .

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Extra Spells: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">By the time most wizards reach moderate levels, the maximum number of spells
they may know at any given level may become quite restrictive. For example, a
wizard with an Intelligence of 14 may only know nine spells of one level. In
order to continue to add to his spell book, the wizard must research any spells
above and beyond this limit, instead of simply scribing newfound spells into his
spell book. Obviously, this makes adding spells a tedious and time-consuming
chore after a certain point, but if the PC is willing to spend the money and time,
he may exercise this option. Again, since the spell description already
exists, the PC can go on to <A HREF="DD03559.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03559.htm">Conducting Research</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> .

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>New Spells: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The most interesting aspect of spell research, the creation of new spells
requires a careful write-up and analysis in order to spot potential problems or
abuses. Since the player must generate all the game-effect information for the
spell, he must first write up a full description and then submit it to the DM for
approval and modification. Note that modifying a new spell (i.e., deleting
components, improving casting time or range, or changing the way it works)
constitutes a new spell. Creating a -look-alike? spell to mimic a spell the PC is
unable to learn is also considered to be new spell research. Go on to <A HREF="DD03557.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03557.htm">Describing a Spell</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>and follow the process of approval and research step-by-step.
