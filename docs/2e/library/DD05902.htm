There are quite a lot of tables on the following pages. This shouldn't be
intimidating; the system is detailed, not overly complicated.
<P></P>
Using the tables which follow can be done in more than one way. Random
dice-rolling is OK, and will not give silly combinations of results. Sometimes
odd-appearing combinations result, but these can often be a spur to DM creativity and
generate the most interesting guilds! The DM may also ignore the dice-rolling
and deliberately select results from the tables which he feels will fit his
campaign needs.
<P></P>
The system which follows is detailed, as noted. This for DMs who like lots of
detail! For those who don't, the best bet may be to combine the dice-roll and
deliberate-design approaches; use dice rolls, and alter one or two when the DM
especially wants some result or wants to maximize consistency. Or can't be
bothered to do all the dice-rolling! Also, a few sections of design do not use
tables.
<P></P>
Lastly, the tables mostly have suggested modifiers for basic d20 rolls. For
example, the attitude of the law is determined on a d20 roll which is modified by
social alignment (more hostile for Lawful societies, etc.). It is quite
impossible to list all the possible modifiers for each table. This would eat up
masses of space and no system can foresee all possible modifiers anyway, so only the
key modifiers have been listed in each instance. The DM can easily add further
modifiers as he sees fit, to reflect special circumstances.

<P></P>
<P></P>
Some of the idiosyncratic guild details aren't covered here. For example, any
oaths of fealty the thief may have to pledge, and the exact rules and
constitution (if one exists) of the guild isn't covered here. If a DM wants this kind of
depth of detail, he will surely want to write such details for himself.
<P></P>
Also, infrequent reference is made to any of the kits, proficiencies, or magic
items introduced in this book. This is deliberate, ensuring that DMs who wish
to be cautious about introducing such new elements are not prevented from being
able to use the design system.
<P></P>
In summary, all the really important stuff you are going to need is here, and
for any frills you want to add-go ahead!
