The Smuggler is a halfling thief who gives every appearance of being an honest
trader. In fact, he or she would <I>prefer</I> to be a straight-forward and upright merchant, but (generally speaking) the
impossible situation created by taxes and tolls of intrusive humans, dwarves,
and elves drives him or her to more underhanded dealings. Thus, he or she imports
and exports many things from many places--most of which are not supposed to be
leaving or arriving at these specific locations.
<P></P>
The reasons for smuggling goods vary considerably; the following are the most
common among them:
<P></P>
<B>Excessive Taxation.</B> A local government may wish to retain a monopoly on a local product (wine
from the duke's vineyard, for example) and so seizes or stamps a high tariff on
any competing goods brought into the duchy.
<P></P>
<B>Belligerent Status.</B> Two rival states involved in a border dispute will often prohibit trade with
the enemy. Local farmers and tradesmen, however, don't always grasp the wisdom
of a policy that cuts them off from their customers--thus, the aid of a
Smuggler can keep the economy alive.
<P></P>
<B>Contraband.</B> A particular commodity might be banned outright, with penalties of varying
severity for those who violate the prohibition. If a rival religious sect, for
example, values bloodstones in its rituals, the entrenched state religion might
bar that stone from the realm, decreeing that anyone caught with a bloodstone be
put to death. Whatever the nature of the contraband, chances are that it is
very valuable to someone--and consequently, there's a great deal of profit
incentive for the bold Smuggler.
<P></P>
A Smuggler must have a Charisma or Intelligence score of at least 13.
<P></P>
Roads to Adventure: Smugglers almost always begin as traders, transporting
goods from one location to another, turning a small profit, and bringing something
new back to the point of origin. Sooner or later, as he or she expands his or
her routes and the world changes, such a trader runs afoul of one of the above
prohibitions--and the pragmatic halfling doesn't see why such a minor detail
should change the way he or she conducts business. Thus, the merchant continues
to do what he or she has always done--but with a little more risk, and a little
more profit.
<P></P>
Tied into the Smuggler's normal way of life can be any number of special
missions--tasks which allow the Smuggler to employ his or her skills in the name of
a higher cause. Rescue of a prisoner is one, or the delivery of a message or
item of great importance. A Smuggler can function as a very effective spy,
reporting back on the mood of the local people as well as more typical information on
land features and defensive preparations.
<P></P>
Role: The Smuggler is a vital cog in the unofficial economy of virtually any
region in a civilized world--for without him or her, a far greater proportion of
the wealth would remain in the hands of those who hold the reins of power.
Many goods that would otherwise have no outlet find their way to customers thanks
to the intrepid Smuggler. Whether he or she carts it down rural highways or
barges it along placid streams, the Smuggler will, quietly and reliably, see that
his or her cargo reaches its destination.
<P></P>
Smugglers build a network of loyal friends and companions (which is why high
Charisma is such an asset) and treat these accomplices well in return for
protection and help.
<P></P>
The value of the goods smuggled is dependent on two factors: the market for
those goods at their destination (supply and demand) and the difficulties and
dangers endured by the smuggler in transporting them. Something which is valuable
to begin with that now carries the threat of death will bring many times its
normal worth to the Smuggler.
<P></P>
Secondary Skills: Either the Trader/Barterer or Teamster/Freighter secondary
skills are appropriate for the Smuggler.
<P></P>
Weapon Proficiencies: Any.
<P></P>
Bonus Nonweapon Proficiencies: All Smugglers gain the Local History
proficiency for areas on their regular routes. Also, Smugglers pick up languages during
their travels, gaining the ability to speak and understand an additional
language every other level, starting at second level. Naturally, the new language must
be one he or she has had contact with during the course of the previous two
levels of experience.
<P></P>
Recommended Nonweapon Proficiencies: Riding, Appraising, Disguise, and Forgery
can all help a Smuggler in his or her work.
<P></P>
Thieving Skill Emphasis: Move Silently helps a Smuggler avoid attracting
unwanted attention, while Hear Noise often alerts him or her to unwanted company.
<P></P>
Equipment: Unless he or she transports very small quantities, the Smuggler
needs some way to haul cargo. Wagons and carts are easy to trace, so Smugglers
prefer either some form of boat (e.g., canoe, river raft, or small sailboat) or a
pack animal (such as a mule, pony, donkey, or large hound). In general, a
Smuggler will only use a wheeled vehicle when he or she has a very good road to
follow and is certain his or her smuggling activities have gone unsuspected.
<P></P>
Special Benefits: A Smuggler who possesses the Local History proficiency for
an area gains a +4 bonus to NPC reaction checks in that area. He or she will
also have full knowledge of any hidden pathways or secret trails along his or her
regular route.
<P></P>
Special Hindrances: The inherent risks of challenging authority, including
threat of imprisonment or worse, are the primary drawbacks to the Smuggler's
career.
