<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Most thrown weapons only require one hand to use; there’s no reason why a
character couldn’t carry a shield or a second weapon in his off-hand. A character
can’t throw weapons and make a melee attack in the same round—he has to choose
one or the other.
<P></P>
Size M or larger thrown weapons can be used in conjunction with a charge
attack. The character performs his charge as normal, but he pulls up short of his
target by 10 to 20 feet and uses his momentum to add to the javelin or axe throw.
This attack confers the movement and +2 attack bonus of a charge, but the
attacker suffers the charge penalties, too.
