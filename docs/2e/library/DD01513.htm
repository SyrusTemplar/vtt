<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A multi-class character always uses the most favorable combat value and the
best saving throw from his different classes.
<P></P>
The character's hit points are the average of all his Hit Dice rolls. When the
character is first created, the player rolls hit points for each class
separately, totals them up, then divides by the number of dice rolled (round fractions
down). Any Constitution bonus is then added to the character's hit points. If
one of the character's classes is fighter and he has a Constitution of 17 or
18, then he gains the +3 or +4 Constitution bonus available only to warriors
(instead of the +2 maximum available to the other character classes).
<P></P>
Later the character is likely to gain levels in different classes at different
times. When this happens, roll the appropriate Hit Die and divide the result
by the number of classes the character has (round fractions down, but a Hit Die
never yields less than 1 hit point). The character's Constitution bonus is
split between his classes; thus, a fighter/mage gets ½ of his Con bonus when he
goes up a level as a fighter and the other ½ of the Con bonus when he goes up a
level as a mage. A fighter/mage/thief would get 1/3 of his bonus when he goes up
as a fighter, 1/3 when he goes up as a mage, and the other 1/3 when he goes up
as a thief.
<P></P>
If the optional proficiency system is used, the character starts with the
largest number of proficiency slots of the different classes. Thereafter, he gains
new proficiency slots at the fastest of the given rates. To determine the
character's initial money, roll according to the most generous of the character's
different classes.

<I> Rupert's character, Morrison the Multi-Faceted, is a half-elf
fighter/mage/thief. At 1st level, Morrison rolls three dice for hit points: 1d10 (fighter), 1d6
(thief), and 1d4 (mage). The results are 6, 5, and 2. Their sum (13) is
divided by three and rounded down to equal 4 (13/3=4-1/3=4). Morrison begins the game
with 4 hit points. Later, Morrison reaches 2nd level as a thief before he
reaches 2nd level as a fighter or a mage. He rolls 1d6 for additional hit points
and the result is 4. He divides this by 3 (because he has three classes) and
rounds down. Morrison gets 1 more hit point when he becomes a 2nd-level thief. (He
will also roll 1d10 and 1d4 [both rolls divided by 3] when he reaches 2nd level
as a fighter and as a mage, respectively.)

Multi-class characters can combine abilities from their different classes with
the following restrictions:
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Warrior:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A multi-classed warrior can use all of his abilities without restriction. The
warrior abilities form the base for other character classes.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Priest:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Regardless of his other classes, a multi-classed priest must abide by the
weapon restrictions of his mythos. Thus, a fighter/cleric can use only bludgeoning
weapons (but he uses the warrior combat value). He retains all his normal
priest abilities.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wizard:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A multi-classed wizard can freely combine the powers of the wizard with any
other class allowed, although the wearing of armor is restricted. Elves wearing
elven chain can cast spells in armor, as magic is part of the nature of elves.
However, elven chain is extremely rare and can never be purchased. It must be
given, found, or won.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Thief:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A multi-classed thief cannot use any thieving abilities other than open locks
or detect noise if he is wearing armor that is normally not allowed to thieves.
He must remove his gauntlets to open locks and his helmet to detect noise.
