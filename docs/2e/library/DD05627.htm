When the followers of one faith make war on the followers of another, the
priests get involved in the action. Since these wars tend to take place between
entire cultures, the player-character priest will probably be an ally of the other
player-characters. In this case, his temple superiors are likely to ask him to
round up some capable allies and go on dangerous missions into enemy
territories, or to hold a crucial mountain pass during a military campaign.
