<P></P>
The God of Death is, naturally, a terrifying figure whom man regards as an
enemy, an unavoidable doom.
<P></P>
But this doesn't mean that death-gods are evil. Most, in fact, are true
neutral. A death-god can be the King of the Land of the Dead, the Grim Reaper who
cuts down the living, or the Guide of the Souls who helps the departed spirit on
to its reward or next existence.
<P></P>
Priests of the death-god are often agents who must &quot;help&quot; people on to the
afterlife, especially if such people have successfully thwarted Death in the past.
This duty may take the form of assassination, or of mercy-killing. In some
campaigns, spirits sometimes escape the afterlife and return to the land of the
living; the death-god's priests must hunt them down and capture them for return
to their proper place.
<P></P>
Death-gods are equally likely to be male or female.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Ancestors,
Community, Darkness/Night, Disease, Justice/Revenge, Life-Death-Rebirth Cycle, and
Time. Priests of this god are sometimes (at individual DM discretion) allies of
the priests of the philosophy of Evil, but this is actually not common,
regardless of how scary the god of Death might be. The priests of this god dislike the
priests of Fertility and Healing, and (at the DM's discretion) Strength.
<P></P>
<B>Alignment:</B> The deity is usually completely neutral. His priests may be of <I>any </I>alignment: Some will be evil-doers who serve him by sending souls to him as
fast as possible, while others could be good priests guiding their followers to
their inevitable destiny. The flock can be of any alignment, but the evil ones
will specifically be followers of evil priests.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<B>Duties of the Priest:</B> Guidance. Vigilance against any being which is unnaturally keeping Death at
bay. The key word here is<I> unnaturally</I>, meaning in defiance of the gods. Wizards using<I> potions of longevity</I> are okay, until they reach an age of three hundred or so, at which time these
priests become their enemies. Healers who cure injury and disease are
accepted, unless they stumble onto some technique or magic that allows them to imbue
immortality. Even priests who can <I>resurrect</I> or <I>reincarnate</I> are acceptable, because if the gods didn't want them to be able to, they
wouldn't have given them the ability to do this.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon and Armor Restrictions:</B> Weapons Permitted: Battle axe (usually styled as a headman's axe),
dagger/dirk, knife, lasso (often tied in the fashion of a noose), scythe, sickle,
stiletto, sword/khopesh, sword/short. Armor Permitted: None; no shields. All together,
these constitute Medium combat abilities.
<P></P>
<B>Other Limitations:</B> Priests of the god of Death must remain celibate. They need not remain chaste.
<P></P>
<B>Spheres of Influence:</B> Major Access to All, Astral, Charm, Divination, Protection. Minor Access to
Guardian, Necromantic, Sun, Weather. Option: Evil priests can substitute major
access to Healing for major access to Protection, but can only use the reversed
versions of the Healing spells.
<P></P>
<B>Powers:</B> <I>Inspire Fear</I> (Designing Faiths chapter). <I>Command Undead</I> (same as the evil Cleric ability). The priest of the Death-god does <I>not</I> have to be evil in order to use this power. This is a rare exception to the
rule that only evil priests can command undead.
<P></P>
<B>Followers and Strongholds:</B> The followers are received at 8th level, and consist of three third-level
priests and six first-level priests of the same order, plus special agents whose
class is determined by the specific aspect of the god; these agents consist of
one fifth-level character, two third-level characters, and four first-level
characters. If this is a fearsome, terrifying god of death, these agents will be
thieves who act as assassins. If it is a god of the collection of the dead, one
who escorts the dead souls to their final rewards, the agents will be specialist
wizards: Necromancers. If it is a god of rulership, one who presides over the
afterworld, they will be fighters. The priest may take the following on
adventures: Two priests and three agents of his choice. The priesthood will pay for
half of the cost of stronghold construction at 8th level.
<P></P>
<B>Possible Symbols</B>: Gates, Gravestone, Scissors, Scythe, Shroud, Skull.
