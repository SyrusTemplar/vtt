</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Occasionally characters may find it desirable, useful, or vitally necessary to
bring about the destruction of a magical item. Magical items are more
resistant than ordinary ones, but they are hardly indestructible, as <A HREF="DD00331.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00331.htm">Table 29</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> shows.
<P></P>
Characters who have possession of a device and are determined to destroy it
can do so at will. They need only snap the blade of a magical sword or burn a
lock or whatever.
<P></P>
It is possible to target specific magical items held by others, but it is very
difficult. (In fact, it is no easier or harder than attacking a non-magical
item.) Attempting to destroy an enemy's magical item may require attack rolls,
saving throws, and item saving throws.
<P></P>
The breaking of a magical item should result in something more dramatic than
the breaking of a vase or a windowpane. As DM you are perfectly justified in
describing a dramatic explosion of force, a small whirlwind, a foul stench, or
whatever seems most appropriate to the moment.
<P></P>
For some items, particularly some staves, there are specific rules that define
the effects of the item's destruction. Such cases are rare and the effects are
devastating, so they are recommended only for those in the area. You might,
for example, dictate that characters within 1 foot, 5 feet, or even 10 feet
suffer 1d8 points of damage.
<P></P>
This is just an example?the actual damage can vary, at your discretion.
Remember, however, that such damage should only be used for effect; it should never
kill or seriously injure a character. After all, killing the character in the
explosion of his own magical sword is piling injury upon insult; the loss of a
prized magical treasure is bad enough!
