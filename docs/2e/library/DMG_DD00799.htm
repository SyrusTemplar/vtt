<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ring of the Ram:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This ornate ring can be of any hard metal, usually a silver alloy or iron. It
has the head of a ram (or a buck goat) as its device. Anyone who attempts a <I>detect magic</I> on the ring discovers an <I>evocation</I> upon it.
<P></P>
The wearer can cause the ring to give forth a ram-like force, manifested by a
vaguely discernible shape which resembles the head of a ram or goat. This force
strikes one target for 1d6 points of damage if one charge is expended, 2d6
points if two charges are used, or 3d6 points if three charges (the maximum) are
used. The ring is quite useful for knocking opponents off walls or ladders, or
over ledges, among other things. The force of the blow is considerable, and a
victim who fails to save versus spell is knocked down. The range of this power is
30 feet. The target of the blow applies adjustments to the saving throw from
the following list:

The DM can make circumstantial adjustments according to need. For instance, a
fire giant balanced on a narrow ledge should <I>not</I> gain any benefit from Strength and weight unless he knows that he's about to
be struck by the force of the ring. This is a case where common sense will
serve best.
<P></P>
In addition to its attack mode, the <I>ring of the ram</I> also has the power to open doors as if a person of 18/00 Strength were doing
so. If two charges are expended, the effect is as for a character of 19
Strength, and if three charges are expended, the effect is as if a 20 Strength were
used. Magically <I>held</I> or <I>locked</I> portals can be opened in this manner.
<P></P>
Structural damage from the ramlike force is identical to an actual battering
ram, with double or triple damage accruing for applications of two or three
charges. Magical items struck by the ramlike force must save versus <I>crushing blow</I> if three charges are used; otherwise, the force will not affect them.
Nonmagical items which are the target of the force save versus <I>crushing blow</I> from the impact.
<P></P>
A ring of this sort will have from 6 to 10 charges when discovered. It can be
recharged by a wizard employing <I>enchant an item</I> and <I>Bigby's clenched fist</I> in combination.
