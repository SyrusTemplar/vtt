Any character may choose to make an unarmed attack instead of attacking with
his weapons. There are four basic types of unarmed combat: punching, wrestling,
overbearing, and martial arts.

A character can perform an unarmed attack on his base initiative if he doesn’t
have to move to reach his target, or he can take a half-move action to close
for combat. Attacking armed opponents (including monsters with natural attacks)
is dangerous for an unarmed fighter; if the character attacks an armed creature
that is threatening him, he suffers an immediate attack of opportunity from
his intended victim. The armed defender gains a +4 bonus on his attack roll and
his damage roll against an unarmed attacker.

Monsters with natural weaponry almost never make unarmed attacks. However, it
is possible for intelligent creatures to “pull in their claws” and try to
batter a character into unconsciousness. Monsters without natural attacks may resort
to unarmed combat if they are disarmed or want to capture their enemy.
