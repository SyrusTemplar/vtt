This is an optional step. In some game settings, communities will have
definite dominant social alignments (see WORLD OF GREYHAWKÂ® Fantasy Game Setting).
Sometimes, while a specific alignment cannot be stated, a general trend (for
example, to good rather than evil) can be given. Social alignment along the
good-neutral-evil, and lawful-neutral-chaotic axes, should be recorded if the DM is
happy that he knows them.
<P></P>
If the alignment is divided, the alignment of the rulers should be used for
later dice roll modifiers, but the fact that the common people are different
should also be noted.
