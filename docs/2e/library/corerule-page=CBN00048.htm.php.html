</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The necromancer can cause his or her hands to glow with a blue, flickering
aura. This frigid radiance can both drain and paralyze the wizard’s victims.
First, any living creature touched by the icy hands suffers the effect of a modified <I>chill touch</I> spell. If the victim fails his or her saving throw, the touch causes 2d4
points of damage and (temporarily) drains 1 point of both Strength and
Constitution. If the saving throw is successful, though, the victim only loses 1d4 points
of damage and just 1 point of Strength. Second, if the necromancer is at least
16th level, the victim must make a second save or be paralyzed for 3–12 rounds.
<P></P>
The necromancer can activate or deactivate this power at will. It never
interferes with spellcasting. Also, the cold blue aura provides light like a dim
torch (certainly enough light to walk or read by).
