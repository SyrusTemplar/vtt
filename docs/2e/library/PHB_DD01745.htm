</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Healing spells, potions, and magical devices can speed the process of healing
considerably. The specifics of such magical healing methods are described in
the spell descriptions in this book and in the <A HREF="DMG_DD00495.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00495.htm">DMG</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> (for magical items). By using these methods, wounds close instantly and vigor
is restored. The effects are immediate.

Magical healing is particularly useful in the midst of combat or in
preparation for a grievous encounter. Remember, however, that the characters' opponents
are just as likely to have access to magical healing as the player
characters--an evil high priest is likely to carry healing spells to bestow on his own
followers and guards. Healing is not, of itself, a good or evil act.
<P></P>
Remember that under no circumstances can a character be healed to a point
greater than his original hit point total. For example, say a character has 30 hit
points, but suffers 2 points of damage in a fight. A while later, he takes an
additional point of damage, bringing his current hit point total to 27. A
spellcaster couldn't restore more than 3 points to him, regardless of the healing
method used. Any excess points are lost.
