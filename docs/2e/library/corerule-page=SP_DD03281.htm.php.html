With this power, the user opens a vaguely shimmering portal, which lets him
travel from place to place in his own dimension by piercing other dimensions at
right angles. This has two advantages over a dimensional door. The first being
that a dimension walk isn’t physically traumatizing, and the second being that
the range of travel is greater. The user can actually travel through this
dimension at the speed of 21 miles per turn. However, this power allows only the user
to travel, and the portal closes behind him instantly.
<P></P>
The user finds himself engulfed in a featureless, inky grayness. He can’t see
where he is or where he’s going. He has only his instinct to guide him, and he
must make a Wisdom check every turn. If these checks succeed, he’ll find
himself at his chosen destination when he steps out of the dimensional realm. If any
check fails, he strays off course by several miles. The DM can place the
character in any location within the maximum distance he traveled from his starting
point. It’s up to the user to figure out his location, as the power does nothing
to help him gain his bearings.
<P></P>
The user can take with him whatever he can carry, though <I>bags of holding</I> and other dimensional devices spill their contents if taken into the gray
realm. If anything lives in the gray, it never bothers (or can’t interact) with
dimension walkers.
