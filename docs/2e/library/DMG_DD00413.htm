Once characters decide to attack and the order of initiative has been
determined, it is time to resolve all the action. Many factors must be considered in
each attack: How many people can surround a character? Will a shield block an
attack from the rear? Can a character run across a chamber, dodging attackers, in
a single round? Can a character win without killing his foe? Is it possible to
block an attack?

Although the mechanics of combat are very simple, there are many different and
unusual situations that come up during role-playing battles. Every battle is
unique. One key to DMing memorable combat scenes is to remember that not every
situation can be anticipated; you just have to combine the rules here with good
judgment.
