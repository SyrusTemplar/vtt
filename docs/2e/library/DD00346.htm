The books themselves require few special materials, but the workmanship must
be exact, flawless. Even the slightest mistake in copying a spell ruins it. This
is not work for a common scribe.
<P></P>
Compounding the problem, the bizarre formulas and diagrams found in a spell
book can't be reproduced by normal medieval printing methods. Spell book work
must be done slowly and laboriously by hand. The standard amount of time required
to prepare a spell book is one to two days of work per spell level of the spell
being entered.
<P></P>
Occasionally, prepared spell books can be found for sale, but few wizards
choose to trust the success or failure of their magical efforts to the work of
others. Rare is the wizard who doesn't prepare his own spell books.
<P></P>
Materials used in a spell book must be of the highest quality. No wizard wants
to run the risk of dampness causing his ink to run, a blot on the parchment
causing a spell to be misinterpreted, bookworms making a feast of page six, the
wind blowing a loose page away, or a spilled retort turning the whole book into
a sodden mass.
<P></P>
Careful treatment, common sense, and quality materials are essential to
prevent these disasters. Strong bindings or cases are used to protect the interiors.
Clear sheets are needed to record the spells. The best bold inks and the
sharpest pens must be used for writing. Aromatic compounds are recommended to deter
bookworms and moths, while other preparations should be used to protect against
mold, mildew, and dry rot. All this costs money.
