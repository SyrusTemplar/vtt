Reputation is treated much like a special proficiency, although no
proficiency slots are (or can be) spent on it. When a situation arises in which the
bard's reputation should be considered, 1d20 is rolled-this is called a
reputation check. Any roll equal to or less than the bard's reputation level is
considered a success. However, no such roll should ever replace role-playing. In fact,
the bard player should role-play any situation before a reputation check is
made. The Dungeon Master should then assign an adjustment to the reputation check
based upon the role-playing.
<P></P>
If a bard is attempting to alter encounter reactions (<I>i.e.,</I> influence reactions or some similar ability), a successful reputation check
indicates that the bard can adjust the reactions by two levels instead of the
typical one.
<P></P>
A reputation can be used as an invisible key. A successful reputation check
can get a bard into private parties or functions even when the bard isn't on the
guest registry. A reputable bard will also find it easy to get a seat at the
most prominent banquet hall in town, even if there is a long line and the bard
failed to make a reservation.
<P></P>
Dealing with prominent public figures is also easier with a good reputation. A
city's mayor is more likely to invite a reputable person to dinner than a
commoner. Reputation can also be used to help smooth out deals, such as the price
required to rent the public theater for a weekend's performance.
<P></P>
Many other uses of reputation exist and should be adjudicated by the Dungeon
Master.
