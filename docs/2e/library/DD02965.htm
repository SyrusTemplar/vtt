<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Non-Adventurers</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> <I>Player’s Option</I> rules gives DMs the opportunity to expand nonplayer characters. No longer
will every blacksmith, jeweler, or horse-trainer have a THAC0 of 20 and be limited
to 1d6 hit points. A DM’s cast of regularly-appearing NPCs can have more
substance.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Important NPCs should be created using the <I>Player’s Option</I> rules. This includes generating the six ability scores, determining the 12
subability scores, and deciding the race. Character points should be allotted for
weapon and nonweapon proficiencies. NPCs who are not adventurers should not be
awarded class-based character points. Instead, the DM should determine how
experienced the NPCs are. Three levels of expertise are defined below.

Roll 1d6+2 to determine their hit points (plus or minus any Constitution modifiers
that apply). Give these NPCs 10 character points to purchase proficiencies,
traits, and disadvantages. Any character points unspent from the purchase of
racial abilities also may spent in this way.

their hit points and add any Constitution bonus. Skilled NPCs also 15 character
points to spend, plus any unspent from the purchase of racial abilities.

have 20 character points, plus any unspent from the purchase of racial
abilities. Master NPCs can be quite hardy. Roll 2d6+6 to determine their hit points. Add

If DMs advance an important NPC from one level to the next, simply supply the
NPC with an additional 5 character points and add 2 to 6 to the NPC’s hit point
total. DMs can expand this system if they wish, creating even more experienced
NPCs.
