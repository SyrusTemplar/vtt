progression, casting, and recovery system of the AD&amp;D game. Spell points
provide more flexibility and some interesting options such as free magicks and the
ability to cast spells of higher level, but the traditional trappings of magic
remain the same—spells are learned through long, tedious study and forgotten once
they are cast.

In this section, we’ll take a look at several variant magic systems that use
the spell point mechanics to create entirely different methods of using arcane
powers. For example, many books in fantasy literature assume that channelling
magical power through a character’s mind and body is a dangerous and exhausting
exercise; a character can cast spells as long as his stamina holds out. With
these optional systems, a magic system that mirrors this traditional approach can
be integrated into an AD&amp;D campaign.
