<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Encumbrance has two basic effects. First, it reduces your character's movement
rate. If encumbrance categories are used, Unencumbered has no effect on
movement, Light reduces the movement rate by 1/3 (round fractions down), Moderate
reduces it by ½, Heavy reduces it by 2/3, and Severe lowers the movement rate to
1. If the optional system is used, the character's movement rate is reduced to
the amount found by using <A HREF="DD01640.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01640.htm">Table 48</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. The movement rate determines how far your character can move in a round,
turn, hour, and day. As his movement rate gets lower, your character moves slower
and slower. See “<A HREF="DD01774.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01774.htm">Movement</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">” in Chapter 14: Time and Movement for more details.

Encumbrance also reduces your character's combat abilities. If encumbrance
reduces your character to ½ of his normal movement rate, he suffers a -1 penalty
to his attack roll. If he is reduced to 1/3 or less of his normal movement rate,
the attack penalty is -2 and there is an additional AC penalty of +1. If your
character's movement is reduced to 1, the attack roll penalty is -4 and the AC
penalty is +3. Clearly, the wise thing for a heavily encumbered character to do
is to quickly drop most of his gear before entering battle.
