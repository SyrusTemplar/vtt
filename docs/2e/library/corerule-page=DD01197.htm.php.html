Foes capable of challenging high-level adventurers are not stay-at-home types
who sit in their bedchambers waiting for groups of PCs to come along and attack
them. They make plans and actively try to implement them. Particularly alert
foes might notice PCs encroaching on their territory and take steps to
discourage or defeat them before they can inflict too much damage.
<P></P>
Even foes who have no immediate plans for sweeping conquests should have a
personal agenda to follow.
