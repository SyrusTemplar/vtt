Minotaurs are either cursed humans or the offspring of minotaurs and humans.
They usually dwell in underground labyrinths, for they are not confused in these
places, which gives them an advantage over their prey.
<P></P>
Minotaurs are huge, well over 7 feet tall, and quite broad and muscular. They
have the head of a bull but the body of a human male. Their fur is brown to
black while their body coloring varies as would a normal human's. Clothing is
minimal, usually a loin cloth or skirt.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Minotaurs are very strong (equivalent human Strength of 18). Against man-sized
opponents (minimum 6 feet tall) they may butt for 2-8 points of damage.
Against smaller opponents, they bite for 1-4 points of damage. If a minotaur is 30
feet or more from its opponent, it can lower its head and charge against any
creature that is at least 6 feet tall. If successful, the charge causes double
head-butt damage. In addition to these attacks, most minotaurs also carry weapons
-- a huge axe (treat as a halberd) or flail, with which it inflicts normal
damage +2.
<P></P>
Minotaurs are not particularly intelligent, but are extremely cunning and have
excellent senses. They have a +2 bonus on their surprise rolls, have
infravision, and can track prey by scent like a ranger, with 50% accuracy. They always
pursue an unfamiliar scent. Minotaurs are immune to <I>maze</I> spells. They attack any intruder without fear, and will retreat only if the
creature is obviously beyond their ability to defeat (+3 to morale score in
combat).
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Minotaurs live in communities of up to eight members. If the community
contains more than six minotaurs, one will be an elder minotaur with 18/50 Strength
and 8+4 Hit Dice. The minotaur elder is the clan leader; he remains in the center
of the labyrinth and raises young minotaurs while others hunt. He is always
encountered in the center of a labyrinth.
<P></P>
A minotaur's labyrinth is rarely natural. Often an evil wizard or a tyrant
will construct a labyrinth and place the minotaur family there, feeding it
prisoners and slaves on a regular basis.
<P></P>
Occasionally this tyrant will be killed and the minotaurs forced to fend for
themselves; since creatures rarely enter a labyrinth on their own accord, these
minotaurs will usually be ravenously hungry.
<P></P>
Minotaurs speak their own primitive language and are 25% likely to speak a
halting form of common. They have little culture; their lives resemble animals
more than humans. Their culture venerates physical strength above all else and
particularly strong human fighters have been known to earn their respect. They
worship crude gods and have weak clerics (maximum 3rd-level shaman). Rumors
persist of more intelligent minotaurs with developed societies.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The curse which creates minotaurs is unknown, but sages suspect it involves
&quot;crimes against the natural order.&quot; Minotaurs are always male. It is also said
that the first minotaur was originally a great and ill-tempered human fighter; he
wanted to be as strong as a bull and his wish was granted in the most hideous
manner possible. Minotaurs breed with human females to produce offspring, which
are male minotaurs. Minotaurs have a lifespan of 200 years. They can live
without food for years at a time, but are always hungry unless they are fed
regularly. They are meat-eaters, but their curse causes them to prefer a diet of human
flesh. Those transformed into minotaurs by curses may be restored to human
form by a <I>wish,</I> but those who were born as minotaurs cannot be made human. Gnolls are their
natural enemies; they will kill each other on sight.
<P></P>
Minotaur components are sometimes used in spells and potions, and might be
used in magical items involving strength, location, and misdirection.
