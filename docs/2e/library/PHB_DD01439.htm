<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> All nonhuman PC races (also called ?demihuman? races) have minimum and maximum
requirements for their ability scores. If you want to have a demihuman
character, the character's ability scores must be within the allowable range. The
minimums and maximums for each race are listed on <A HREF="DD01440.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01440.htm">Table 7</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> (the minimums are listed before the slash; the maximums are listed after the
slash). Your character's sex has no effect on these minimums or maximums.
<P></P>
Consult <A HREF="DD01440.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01440.htm">Table 7</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> <I>before</I> making any racial adjustments to your character's ability scores. If the
basic scores that you rolled up meet the requirements for a particular race, your
character can be of that race, even if later modifications change the ability
scores so they exceed the maximums or don't meet the minimums. Once you satisfy
the requirements at the start, you never have to worry about them again.

be a member of a demihuman race. Any character can be a human, if the player so
desires.
