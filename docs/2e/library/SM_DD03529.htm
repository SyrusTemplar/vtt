Priests and Spell Points </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Just as wizards can create or customize their own spell progression by using
spell points, priests can as well. Instead of memorizing the ?standard? array of
spells of each level, a priest can concentrate his magical power into a small
number of spells at the highest level of power available to him, or he can
instead memorize a greater than normal array of low-level spells. (<A HREF="DD03533.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03533.htm">Table 26</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Priest Spell Point Progression shows the number of spell points available
to a priest as he progresses in level.) Other considerations include the
following:
<P></P>
The priest must be well-rested and have access to a quiet place suitable for
prayer. It takes about 10 minutes per spell level to commit a spell to memory.
<P></P>
The priest is limited in the maximum spell level he may cast, based on his
character level. For example, a 5th-level priest is still limited to spells of
3rd-level or lower.
<P></P>
The priest is limited in the maximum number of spells of each level that he
can memorize, regardless of how many spell points he has available; for example,
a 5th-level character can?t memorize more than six spells of any given spell
level.

Bonus Spell for High Wisdom: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">In addition to the base number of spell points available at each level,
priests with high Wisdom scores gain a special bonus to reflect their piety and
devotion. (This is a standard rule in this spell point system, unlike the optional
bonus spell point rule for wizards with high Intelligence scores.) The number of
bonus spell points depends on the character?s Wisdom score and the maximum
spell level available to him, as shown in <A HREF="DD03534.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03534.htm">Table 27</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Bonus Spell Points for Priest Characters.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I> A 2nd-level priest with a Wisdom of 18 is still limited to spells of 1st-level
or less, so his spell point bonus would be 8 points?enough to purchase the two
1st-level bonus spells he would receive under the <A HREF="PHB_DD01433.htm"></A></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="PHB_DD01433.htm">PHB</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> <I>rules. A 4th-level priest with a Wisdom of 16 is limited to 2nd-level spells,
so he would gain 20 bonus spell points, or enough to select the two 1st- and
two 2nd-level spells he would normally be entitled to.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</I> Note that as a character rises in level, and his maximum spell level
increases, the number of bonus points available to him may increase as well!
<P></P>
Naturally, all of the normal considerations of choosing a spell apply; the
priest does not need a spell book and can choose any spell that falls within his
spheres of access. Spells may be chosen as pre-memorized fixed theurgies (the
priestly equivalent of magicks), or the priest can leave a theurgy open to use
any spell he wishes to by selecting a free theurgy (see the description for <A HREF="DD03378.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03378.htm">wizards</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> .)
