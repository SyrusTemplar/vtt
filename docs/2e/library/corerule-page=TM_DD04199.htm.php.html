By casting this spell, a wizard can change a corpse's features to make it
appear to be someone else. The caster must possess an accurate portrait of the
individual to be duplicated, or must have a clear mental image of the person based
on personal experience.

If <I>animate dead</I> is cast on the body, it can be animated to become a zombie that looks exactly
like the copied person. The double is a mindless automaton, however, having
all the characteristics of a normal zombie.

This spell may be cast on a creature that has already become a zombie. The
wizard must successfully touch the zombie in combat, unless the zombie is
controlled by the caster.
