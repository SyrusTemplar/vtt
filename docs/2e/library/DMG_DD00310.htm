This covers a period of great empires spreading from the Mediterranean. Some
weapons and armor were made of bronze, others of iron, and a few were made of
steel. Most household items were pottery, wood, stone, and wicker. Bronze weapons
were easily dulled and, in game terms, break or bend when a &quot;1&quot; is rolled on
the attack roll. Stirrups hadn't been invented, so characters can't use heavy
lances, and charge attacks can't be made with normal lances.
