<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Jewel of Attacks:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This gleaming gem radiates magic and appears to be a valuable item. It is
cursed, however, and doubles the likelihood of encountering wandering monsters and
the likelihood of pursuit when monsters are encountered and the party seeks to
evade them by flight. Once picked up, the <I>jewel of attacks</I> will always magically return to its finder (secreting itself in pouch, bag,
pack, pocket, etc.) until a <I>remove curse</I> spell or an <I>atonement</I> is cast upon him.
