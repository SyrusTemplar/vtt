This god's interest is in the education and &quot;improvement&quot; of other cultures...
especially those considered &quot;lesser&quot; cultures by the principal culture of the
campaign.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are charged with the education of the population in
whatever subjects the god espouses. If the god wants everyone to be literate, the
priests teach Reading/Writing, free of charge, to as many students as they can
teach at a time.
<P></P>
However, if the god is simply of the opinion that one whole culture is the
best culture of all, then his priests are charged with turning every other
culture into this best culture. Consequently, the priesthood invades other nations,
peacefully if possible, setting up missions and trying to convert the
population wholesale to the worship of this god, and to the cultural behavior of the
god's favorite civilization.
<P></P>
When peaceful intrusion is not possible, the priesthood agitates for war with
the other civilization; if the civilization can be conquered, they move in to
convert is population by force. In these situations, we see mass destruction of
the temples and sanctuaries of the &quot;lesser&quot; gods of this culture, elimination
of their priesthoods, and ruthless suppression of the cultural elements which
the culture-god's priesthood wants to change.
<P></P>
Not all culture-gods have to be racist or contemptuous of other cultures.
Sometimes they're just education-minded gods who want to bestow <I>godly</I> cultural elements on the human population; in such cases, the priesthood is
not one that proposes war or holds inquisitions to suppress other sects.
<P></P>
Culture-gods are most likely to be male.
<P></P>
