The Swashbucklers campaign is for players who want characters with a lot of
style adventuring in a sophisticated setting. The Musketeers novels of Alexandre
Dumas are a perfect source for character types, adventure ideas, and settings
for such a campaign.
<P></P>
In the Swashbucklers campaign, the player-characters are elegant heroes,
experts with the rapier, making their way in a huge city. They tend to live
hand-to-mouth, gaining large treasures one day and spending through them in a very
short time, so they may be rich and generous one day and stealing their food the
next. This is not a campaign devoted to honest and hard-working heroes. The PCs
may be as honorable as their players want, but they're still charming rakes who
like to get by on as little effort as necessary.
<P></P>
However, when danger looms, they'll gladly throw themselves into an adventure,
one which may lead them on a desperate horseback race across the land or into
the dark catacombs under the city, where monsters dwell. Adventures may lead
them from the court of their king, to the barracks of the nation's army (as they
briefly become soldiers or commissioned officers), to the front lines of the
ongoing war with a neighboring power, to desperate missions behind enemy lines,
to secret forays into the capital city's prison (so that they might rescue the
king's secret twin or their friend who's been imprisoned for knowing too much).
<P></P>
The heroes are in a constant competition to out-style the other. In combat,
each tries to be the flashiest. In romance, each tries to be the most witty, most
courteous, most gallant. Also, they're in similar competition with rival NPC
swashbucklers, who are often members of a competing military force or fencing
academy.
<P></P>
In all, it's a campaign of great style and showmanship.
