<P></P>
When a spell is cast, it appears in the space immediately ahead of the caster;
if it is a defensive spell, it can appear in the caster's space instead. No
spell moves on the round when it is cast. If an opponent's spell already occupies
the space, the two spells must check for combat.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Movement: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A spell already in the arena when a round begins moves one or more spaces
toward the opponent. The spell must move at least one square forward unless it is
locked or it is a defensive spell occupying the caster's square; the latter type
of spell has a movement of 0 and remains where it is until it is destroyed in
combat or the duel ends. A spell need not move its full movement rate.
<P></P>
All of the advantaged caster's spells move first, even if combat causes the
advantage to shift to the other caster. When spells move, the spell closest to
the opponent always moves first, then the next closest, and so on until all the
character's spells have moved.
<P></P>
It is possible for two or more spells to occupy the same space. All spells
cast by one character can freely move through each other or stop in the same
space. When two friendly spells begin a round in the same space, the spell with the
fastest movement rate moves first.
<P></P>
Spells from different casters also can move through each other or stop in the
same space if they are not required to conduct combat. Spells never move
backward unless forced to do so by an opposing spell's special ability.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Combat: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">When two opposing spells meet, the disadvantaged caster must announce his
spell's type (A, D, AD, L, or M). The advantaged caster then checks his spell-s
type against <A HREF="DD01299.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01299.htm">Table 25</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> to determine if the spells battle or if they pass each other. The advantaged
caster is not required to reveal his spell's type, and neither caster is
required to reveal what the spells actually are. Note that some spells must battle
each other even if their types don-t require them to (see the notes on <A HREF="DD01304.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01304.htm">special abilities</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). It is the disadvantaged opponent's responsibility to announce special
abilities that might be relevant.
<P></P>
If combat occurs, it is conducted immediately, and all spell movement
temporarily stops until the combat is resolved.
<P></P>
To conduct combat between spells, each player rolls 1d20 and compares the
result to his spell's power rank. If the roll is higher than the power rank, the
spell fails. If the roll is equal to or less than the power rank, the spell
succeeds.
<P></P>
If one spell fails and the other succeeds, the failed spell is destroyed. If
other opposing spells exist in the same space, battle is conducted with them as
well. If the winning spell was moving when the combat occurred it can finish
its move after the battle. It is possible for one spell to fight several
different battles in a single round, but combat between any one pair of spells is
conducted only once each round.
<P></P>
If both spells fail, the two spells lock. Failure can occur when both spells
roll higher than their power scores or when two spells with the same power
scores tie each other. Locked spells prevent other spells from passing; refer to <A HREF="DD01302.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01302.htm">Locked Spells</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, below.
<P></P>
If both spells succeed, the spell with the higher roll destroys the spell with
the lower roll.
<P></P>
For example, Rary casts a <I>charm person</I> spell (A, PR 10) that meets Serten's <I>cure light wounds</I> spell (D, PR 10). The two spells must battle. Rary rolls a 12 and Serten
rolls a 1. Rary's <I>charm person</I> spell is destroyed because it failed its roll and Serten's <I>cure light wounds </I>spell succeeds. If Rary had rolled a 9 instead of a 12, the <I>charm person</I> would have destroyed the <I>cure light wounds</I> spell because it succeeded with a higher roll. If Serten had rolled a 20 and
Rary had rolled a 12 (or if both had rolled a 10), the two spells would have
locked.
<P></P>
If an opposing spell occupies the space in front of a character during step 3
and the character casts his own spell into that space, the two spells
immediately check for combat.
