<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Globe of Purification:</B> These enchanted glass spheres, 6 inches in diameter, contain the swirling
blue-grey essence of a <I>cloud of purification</I> spell. When the globe is broken, the cloud billows forth, acting exactly as
if the spell had been cast by a 12th-level priest. These devices are often given
to a city's sanitation crews, who descend upon the streets and sewers during
the wee hours of the morning.
