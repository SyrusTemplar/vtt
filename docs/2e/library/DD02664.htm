Characters with this talent are excellent shots with bows or crossbows. They
have an unusually good eye for distance, a knack for judging a tricky shot, and
a smooth and easy aim and release. If the character takes a full round to aim
his shot (i.e., voluntarily holds his action until last in the round) he suffers
no penalty for a medium-range shot and only a ?2 penalty for a long-range
shot. If the character would normally receive multiple attacks with his weapon, he
has to forfeit them in order to use this talent-he can make only one shot per
round.
