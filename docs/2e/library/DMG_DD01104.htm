<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Net of Entrapment:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This magical rope net is strong enough to defy Strength under 20 and is equal
to AC -10 with respect to blows aimed at cutting it. (Normal sawing attempts to
cut it with dagger or sword will not succeed; to sever a strand of the mesh, a
character must hack at it until he does 5 points of damage on a strand.)
<P></P>
Each net is 10 feet square and has a 3-inch-square mesh. It can be thrown 20
feet so as to cover and close upon opponents; each creature in range must roll a
successful saving throw vs. dragon breath to avoid being entrapped. It can be
suspended from a ceiling (or generally overhead) and drop upon a command word.
It can be laid upon the floor and close upward upon command. The net stretches
so as to close over an area up to five cubic feet. It can be loosened by its
possessor on command.
