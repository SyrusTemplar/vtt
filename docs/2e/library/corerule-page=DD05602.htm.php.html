<B>Description: </B>This priest has decided to become part of some sort of outlaw community and
serve that community's religious needs. The trouble is, for the character to take
this kit, this group or community must be sufficiently outlawed that the
priesthood in question does not approve of it. Alternatively, the priest may have
decided that the god's priesthood is not serving him in an appropriate way, and
he will have decided to create his own priestly order serving the same god. In
this case, too, the regular priesthood does not approve of him. In either case,
the priest must believe that he is still serving the god in a fashion that the
god approves of. (The DM, obviously, must agree.)
<P></P>
Friar Tuck, the cleric who tended to Robin Hood's Merry Men, is the classic
example of this type of priest.
<P></P>
This priest, in the pursuit of his duties, is opposed by other priests serving
the same god. In addition, if he's identified himself with an outlaw or pirate
band, he'll be wanted by the authorities as a member of that band.
<P></P>
There are no special ability-score requirements to be an Outlaw Priest.
<P></P>
A priest abandons this kit by leaving the outlaw band or opposing/disbanding
the new religious order, whichever is pertinent. Additionally, by role-playing
in the campaign, he must answer all the charges pressed against him by the
authorities (he might do this by being tried and going to prison for a time, or
paying reparations, or accepting tasks of penance from his temple); if he does not,
he will continue to be opposed by his temple and wanted by the authorities.
<P></P>
<B>Barred:</B> Priests of the gods of Community may not take this kit. Priests of no
Philosophy or Force may take this kit. (They can associate themselves with pirate or
outlaw bands, but there is no censure within their orders because of it, and
therefore no disadvantage to belonging to such a band.)
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> This sort of priest has one of two roles, depending on the situation.
<P></P>
(1) With the first situation mentioned above, the priest has joined an outlaw
or pirate band. In the campaign, then, he's the rogue priest who has decided
that the band deserves his priestly guidance, and that this is more important
than the demands of his priestly order. The priest either agrees with the band's
outlaw activities or ignores them; his concern is that they receive the
blessings of his god. Perhaps, too, he thinks that they'll be a more ethical group with
him around; he may be present to keep them from performing acts of brutality
or rapine, which they might undertake were he not present.
<P></P>
(2) In the second situation mentioned above, the priest is a rogue visionary
who thinks that he must serve his god in a way not approved of by the normal
priesthood. This character is probably someone who went through the temple's
normal priestly training, decided that there was something wrong or lacking in it,
and set out to found his own order. A classic example of this is the situation
where a priesthood has become corrupt and lazy, and a reformer priest has
appeared to try to return the worship of the god to its former honorable state; the
corrupt priests naturally wish to maintain the <I>status quo</I>.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> The priest can choose his own secondary skill. If he's part of a pirate band,
he may wish to choose Sailor, Shipwright or Navigator. If he's part of a
landbound outlaw band, he might choose Forester, Hunter, or Trapper/Furrier. He may
decide on none of these and make a decision based on his life before he entered
the priesthood.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Required: None. Recommended: If Pirate, cutlass*, belaying pin*, bill. If
Outlaw, weapon choices appropriate for the outlaw band. (The &quot;*&quot; symbol refers to
weapons introduced in <I>The Complete Fighter's Handbook</I>.)
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Bonus Proficiency: Religion.
<P></P>
Recommended Proficiencies (Pirate Priest): Pirate's Bonus Proficiencies:
(General) Rope Use, Seamanship, Swimming, Weather Sense, (Warrior, double slots
unless priest-class dictates otherwise) Navigation, (Priest) Engineering (for
shipbuilding), Reading/Writing (for mapmaking), (Rogue, double slots unless
priest-class dictates otherwise) Appraising, Set Snares (in association with Rope Use
skill), Tightrope Walking, Tumbling, (Wizard, double slots unless priest-class
dictates otherwise) Engineering (for shipbuilding), Reading/Writing (for
mapmaking).
<P></P>

Fire-Building, Riding (Land-Based), (Warrior, double slots unless priest-class dictates
otherwise) Animal Lore, Bowyer/Fletcher, Endurance, Hunting, Running, Set
Snares, Survival, Tracking, (Priest) Healing, Herbalism, Local History, (Rogue,
double slots unless priest-class dictates otherwise) Disguise.
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> No restrictions. Within the context of the campaign, if this is a pirate or
outlaw band, it's a bad idea to wear metal armor (banded, brigandine, bronze
plate, chain, field plate, full plate, plate mail, and ring mail). Metal armor
drags pirates down to their deaths when they fall overboard; and it's noisy when
worn by outlaws trying to ambush their prey. But this is just a factor the DM
needs to remember, not a restriction on the kit.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> The main benefit of this kit is that the priest does not have any superiors.
He takes orders from no superior religious authority (unless the god himself
chooses to issue some).
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> The outlaw priest is opposed by the normal priestly order serving his god.
When they hear of his plans, they try to thwart them (break up religious
meetings, disrupt building of his temple, etc.). This priest never gets to build a
temple at cut-rate prices; he must always spend the whole amount to build his
temple. (If he ever abandons his kit, the regular priesthood may accept his temple
as one belonging to the priesthood, but will never recompense him half the money
it took to build it.) If the outlaw priest is part of an outlaw or pirate
band, he is sought by the same authorities that seek that band, and will pay the
same penalties under the law as they do if he is caught.
<P></P>
<B>Wealth Options:</B> Outlaw priests get the standard 3d6x10 gp for starting gold.
<P></P>
<B>Races: </B>No special restrictions.
