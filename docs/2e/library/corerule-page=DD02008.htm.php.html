By means of this spell, the wizard is able to move objects by concentrating on
moving them mentally. The spell can provide either a gentle, sustained force
or a single short, violent thrust.
<P></P>
A sustained force enables the wizard to move a weight of up to 25 pounds a
distance up to 20 feet per round. The spell lasts two rounds, plus one round per
caster level. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or both. An
object moved beyond the caster's range falls or stops. If the caster ceases
concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops. The object can be
telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be
pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated and so on, if the force required is
within the weight limitation. The caster might even be able to untie simple
knots, at the discretion of the DM.
<P></P>
Alternatively, the spell energy can be expended in a single round. The caster
can hurl one or more objects within range, and within a 10-foot cube, directly
away from himself at high speed, to a distance of up to 10 feet per caster
level. This is subject to a maximum weight of 25 pounds per caster level. Damage
caused by hurled objects is decided by the DM, but cannot exceed 1 point of
damage per caster level. Opponents who fall within the weight capacity of the spell
can be hurled, but they are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the
effect. Furthermore, those able to employ as simple a counter-measure as an <I>enlarge</I> spell, for example (thus making the body weight go over the maximum spell
limit), can easily counter the spell. The various <I>Bigby's hand</I> spells also counter this spell.
