The Totemic Druid closely identifies with a particular species of mammal,
reptile, or bird. While Vanier, a typical Totemic Druid, stops short of worshiping
his totem animal, he believes that particular animal represents his spirit. The
Totemic Druid picks a normal (real-world) wild mammal, reptile, or bird as his
totem. This creature cannot be larger than a bear or smaller than a mouse.
Some common choices include the black bear, bobcat, eagle, owl, wolf, rattlesnake,
and beaver. In addition, Vanier's totem animal must correspond to his branch;
if Vanier belongs to the desert druid branch, he can select as his totem only
an animal that normally lives in the desert.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> Totemic Druids tend to adopt characteristics associated with their totem
animal. They feel especially protective of their totem animal in the wild and want
to befriend the creatures. As a Totemic Druid, Vanier acts to promote the
interests of the totem species and its individual members.
<P></P>
Even if his totem is traditional prey (a deer, for example), Vanier never
hunts the animal himself, nor does he eat its meat. While he usually does not try
to ban hunting of his totem (except in the case of endangered species), he
opposes cruel or wasteful hunting practices.
<P></P>
<B>Branch Restrictions:</B> None.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Recommended</I>-- staff.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> Groom, hunter.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonus</I>-- tracking. <I>Recommended</I>--(general) animal handling, animal training; (priest) healing, herbalism;
(warrior) animal lore, survival.
<P></P>
Note that Totemic Druids have a reduced number of proficiency slots. (See
&quot;Special Hindrances.&quot;)
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> The druid should spend his initial allotment of gold pieces entirely on
equipment, as he loses any unspent starting money in excess of 1 gp.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits: </B>A Totemic Druid like Vanier can shapechange into the form of his totem animal
a number of times per day equal to his experience level divided by three
(rounded down), plus one. So, a 3rd- to 5th-level Totemic Druid can change twice per
day, a 6th- to 8th-level druid can change three times per day, and so on. This
ability functions as normal druidic shapechanging, except that the druid does
not regain hit points when shapechanging into or out of the totem form; the
druid's spirit remains so closely bound with the totem that he fully experiences
any damage the animal form took. The Totemic Druid can use this shapechanging
ability <I>in addition</I> to his shapechanging granted powers.
<P></P>
A Totemic Druid can communicate freely with normal or giant examples of the
totem animal species (as with the<I> speak with animals spell</I>). He receives a +4 bonus to any healing, animal training, animal lore, or
animal handling proficiency checks related to the totem. A druid who doesn't have
one of these proficiencies may behave as though he did when dealing with his
totem animal, but does not apply the +4 bonus.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> A Totemic Druid has one fewer nonweapon proficiency slot than normal, as a
result of spending so much time in animal form. So, Vanier would start with three
slots rather than four.
<P></P>
<B>Wealth Options:</B> 3d6x5 gp. Totemic Druids, like Shapeshifters, have a less pressing need for
money due to the amount of time they spend in animal form.
