</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">It doesnâ€™t take a genius to realize that storming a castle or fort of some
kind is dangerous and bloody work. The defenders have the advantage of full cover
and deadly traps or devices to make short work of attackers. Even high-level
characters should think twice before entering the killing zones of a
well-designed gatehouse or keep.
<P></P>
As with dungeons or buildings, the DM should prepare accurate and detailed
maps, with notes about cover and trap locations, before the gaming session. This
will save a lot of time during the game and eliminate the half-hour pauses in
the game while the DM sets up the fight.
