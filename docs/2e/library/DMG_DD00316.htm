Most of the equipment a character buys is assumed to be of average
quality--neither too cheaply made nor too elaborate. Thus, weapons are serviceable with
stout hafts and sturdy blades. The metal is not so poorly tempered as to make the
blade hopelessly brittle. The blade is not elaborately etched and the hilt is
not encrusted with gold. Other items are of everyday make, usefulness and
function superseding artistic needs.

However, quality can vary from item to item. For some items it is important to
know the quality, since this affects a game ability. The three items where
quality is most significant are locks, horses, and weapons. In other instances,
quality becomes important only if you or one of your players wants an item of
exceptional beauty or of exceptionally shoddy construction.
