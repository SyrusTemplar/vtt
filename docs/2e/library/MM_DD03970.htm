The lammasu, a winged leonine figure with a human head, aids and protects
lawful good persons. They are generally kind and friendly to all good creatures.
<P></P>
Lammasu resemble golden-brown lions with the wings of eagles and the heads of
men with shaggy hair and beards. Their formidable appearance is softened by
their regal, compassionate, and beneficent expressions. They communicate in their
own tongue, in common, and through a limited form of telepathy.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Since lammasu are concerned for the welfare and safety of good beings, they
almost always enter combat if they see good creatures being threatened, in the
way least likely to cause harm to the good beings.
<P></P>
Lammasu are able to become invisible or dimension door at will. They radiate a <I>protection from evil, 10' radius</I> (-2 penalty to all evil attacks, +2 bonus to saving throws against evil
attacks). Additionally, they are able to use priest spells up to 4th level, at
7th-level proficiency. Lammasu can employ four 1st-level spells, three 2nd-level
spells, two 3rd-level spells, and one 4th-level spell. They have <I>cure serious wounds</I> (4d8+2) and <I>cure critical wounds</I> (6d8+6), and 10% of lammasu can speak a <I>holy word</I> as well.
<P></P>
If all else fails, lammasu can attack with their two razor-sharp front claws,
inflicting 1d6 points of damage each. If they choose to swoop down from the sky
on a target, this damage is doubled.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The lammasu have a very structured and lawful society, reflecting their
alignment. They are organized in prides, just like lions. They dwell in old,
abandoned temples situated in warm regions. These temples have not lost their
consecration, and in some way, the lammasu are the self-appointed resident guardians of
these high and holy places. As a rule, only one pride of lammasu is ever found
in a 25-mile area; they spread themselves out so they can respond quickly to
any evil outburst.
<P></P>
Lammasu females fight as effectively as the males; for every four lammasu
encountered, one is a female. When found in their lair, there are young equal to
25% of the adult population. Female lammasu have the heads of women, with long,
hair.
<P></P>
Once a month, the pride leaders gather together to consort about how the war
on evil goes. This grouping is called the Whitemoon, since it takes place on the
first night of the full moon. There are usually 6d6 lammasu and 2d4 greater
lammasu, with the latter presiding over the meeting. Such a gathering of lawful
good causes the entire temple where they meet to glow in a pure light, until it
breaks up at dawn. There is perhaps no safer place in all the world that night.
<P></P>
Though they dwell in warm areas, they occasionally visit every clime. They
speak their own tongue as well as common. At times they use a limited form of
telepathy.
<P></P>
Good-aligned strangers are always well received. Neutrals are watched
carefully, but are treated politely unless the outsiders begin causing trouble. Evil
beings are firmly asked to leave, and if they fail to do so, they are attacked by
the pride. In case of trouble, there is a cumulative 10% chance per turn that
a neighboring pride picks up a telepathic summons and come to help out the
original pride. Lammasu harbor an especially strong dislike for lamias and
manticores. Some foolish people confuse lammasu for manticores, which does little to
improve the lammasu disposition toward them.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Lammasu keep the wastelands from being completely overrun by evil creatures.
Their aid to frontier settlements is beyond measurable value.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Greater Lammasu
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">These creatures are slightly larger than a lesser lammasu and one or two may
be found dwelling with a pride of six or more lesser lammasu. Greater lammasu
can travel the Astral and Ethereal Planes, become invisible, teleport without
error and dimension door, all at will. They radiate <I>protection from evil</I> in a 20' radius (-4 penalty to evil attacks and +4 bonus to saving throws)
and have the curative powers of their lesser cousins. Their priest spells consist
of five 1st-level, four 2nd-level, three 3rd-level, two 4th-level, and one
5th-level spell. Fifty percent of greater lammasu can speak a <I>holy word</I> as well. They cast spells as 12th-level priests.
<P></P>
Greater lammasu have empathy, telepathic communication, and speak their racial
speech and the common tongue. Despite their greater stature, these lammasu are
just as gentle and humble as their lesser brethren.
