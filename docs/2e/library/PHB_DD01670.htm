</B>can happen any time characters meet another group unexpectedly (monsters, evil
knights, peasants, etc.). Surprise is simply what happens when one side--a
person or party--is taken unawares, unable to react until they gather their wits.
Their opponents, if unsurprised, are allowed a bonus round of action while the
surprised characters recover. It's entirely possible for both sides in a given
situation to be surprised!

Attacking with surprise gives bonuses to the attack roll (see <A HREF="DD01675.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01675.htm">Table 51</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). A surprised character also has a decreased chance of rolling a successful
saving throw, if one is needed.

Surprise is determined by a die roll and is normally checked at the beginning
of an encounter. Surprise is very unpredictable, so there are very few
modifiers to the roll.
