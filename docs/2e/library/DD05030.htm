Some characteristics and limitations apply to <I>all</I> branches of the druidic order. The following section expands on the rules for
druid characters in the <I>PH</I> (<A HREF="PHB_DD01489.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01489.htm">pgs. 35-38</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">).

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Alignment and Ethos</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
All druids are of neutral alignment and share an ethos devoted to protecting
the wilderness and maintaining natural cycles and a balance between good and
evil (<I>PH</I>, pgs. <A HREF="PHB_DD01494.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01494.htm">37</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, <A HREF="PHB_DD01518.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01518.htm">47</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). For a detailed discussion of the neutral alignment and the beliefs of
druids, refer to <A HREF="DD05067.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD05067.htm">Chapter 4: Role-playing Druids</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Experience and Hit Dice
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
All druids must use the druid column of <A HREF="PHB_DD01478.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01478.htm">Table 23: Priest Experience Levels</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> (<I>PH</I>, p. 33). Druids, like other members of the priest group, use eight-sided Hit
Dice (HD), gaining one die per level from 1st through 9th level. After 9th
level, druids receive an additional 2 hit points per level, but gain no special
bonus for high Constitution.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Proficiencies and Crossovers
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Druids gain proficiencies just like other priests (<A HREF="PHB_DD01523.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01523.htm">PH, p. 50</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">), starting with two weapon and four nonweapon proficiencies.
<P></P>
It is strongly recommended that you, the player, use the optional nonweapon
proficiency rules when creating druid characters with this book. The various
branches of druids (and the druid kits described later) make extensive use of the
nonweapon proficiency system to differentiate among types of druids.
<P></P>
Note that druid nonweapon proficiencies come from the general, priest, and
warrior groups. Druids have access to the warrior group (even though many other
priests do not) because it contains many of the proficiencies associated with
outdoor skills the druid needs to operate in the wilderness.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Money and Equipment
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Druids start with 3d6-10 gp, which they can use to purchase equipment. All but
a few coins (less than 1 gp) must be spent prior to entering play.
<P></P>
If using the optional druid kit rules described later in this book, both the
initial money and the equipment allowed might vary depending on the kit.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Magical Items
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Druids use all magical items normally permitted to priests, with the exception
of written items (books and scrolls) and those types of armor and weapons that
are normally forbidden them. (The weapons and armor permitted to members of
each branch and kit do vary, but they remain similar to those allowed to druids
in the <I>PH</I>.)
<P></P>
Thus, a druid who finds magical chain mail may not wear it, since druids must
use only nonmetallic armor. Similarly, a druid cannot wield a magical mace,
since maces are not among the permitted druidic arms.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>The Secret Language
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
All druids can speak a secret language in addition to other tongues they know.
Using the optional proficiency system, the secret language does not require a
proficiency slot.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>The secret language of the druids has its roots in British tradition. A
language called Thari, derived from Celtic roots, apparently was spoken as a secret
tongue throughout the British Isles by a small number of traveling folk such as
tinkers and bards. It later was adopted by some Gypsy clans in addition to
Romany, their own Indic language. Thari may predate the Dark Ages, and some claim
fluency in it even today. Certain researchers seeking the roots of Thari as a
language distinct from Gaelic have linked its origins to both ancient Celtic
craft guilds and to the historical druids. If the DM wants to name the druids'
secret language, Thari possesses some historical relevance.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</I>Not only can druids use the secret language to provide passwords, they can
speak this private tongue when they wish to baffle nondruidic eavesdroppers. It is
a precise tool for discussing Nature; a druid can say &quot;dense, old-growth pine
forest&quot; in one word rather than a whole phrase.
<P></P>
The secret language has a specialized and detailed vocabulary limited to
dealing with Nature and natural events; beyond this sphere, it is very basic. A
druid could use the secret language to talk about the health of a person, animal,
or plant; discuss the weather; or give detailed directions through the
wilderness. The language also can describe druidic spells, ceremonies, powers, and any
natural and supernatural creatures known to the druids. However, it contains no
words for sophisticated human emotions, for most tools or artifacts (beyond
those used for hunting, farming, or fishing), or for weapons and armor (other than
items druids use). The language also contains few words that refer to concepts
peculiar to sentient beings, like <I>property, justice, theft,</I> or <I>war</I>. Tense distinctions blur in this secret tongue; usually the concepts druids
express bear a certain immediacy or timelessness.
<P></P>
Finally, the secret language of the druids remains a purely spoken tongue. A
few simple runes or marks (symbolizing <I>danger, safe water, safe trail</I>, and so on) exist for marking paths and leaving messages, but the language
cannot communicate actual sentences and complex ideas in writing.
<P></P>
Here's an example of how the secret language works in practice. Suppose two
druids are discussing a magical item and want to converse entirely in the secret
language, using no words borrowed from other tongues. One druid wishes to say:
<P></P>
<P></P>
This magical long sword was a gift to Melinda, wife to King Rupert, from
Rupert's court wizard Drufus. The mage gave it the power to throw lightning bolts. But
then King Rupert grew jealous of Melinda. He had her executed and took the
blade for himself. After Rupert died, the sword was left buried in the dungeons
under his castle.
<P></P>
<P></P>
In the secret language, the story might come out something like this:
<P></P>
<P></P>
This magic scimitar was for the Tall Golden Female, mate of the Man-Leader,
from the Wielder of Magic from the Vale of the White Eagles. He put the call
lightning power in it. But the Man-Leader wanted it. He killed the Tall Golden
Female and took it for himself. He died. The scimitar stayed in the cave under his big
stone man-den.
<P></P>
<P></P>
See the difference? There's no word for <I>long sword</I>, so our druid has substituted &quot;scimitar.&quot; (All druidic weapons have names.)
The idea of a <I>gift</I> is described in more basic terms. In addition, the concept of naming has no
place in this Nature-oriented language; people and creatures are known by
description, status, or place of origin.
<P></P>
<I>Wizard</I> becomes the more generic &quot;wielder of magic.&quot; <I>Lightning</I>, a natural phenomenon, has an equivalent in the secret language. But the
secret language cannot convey a human emotion such as Rupert's <I>jealousy</I>, so the druid has had to substitute less precise phrasing. Similarly, the
private tongue does not cover<I> execution </I>or <I>murder</I>, so the druid used the more generic &quot;killed.&quot; Finally, no druidic term
corresponds to <I>dungeon</I> or <I>castle</I>, so the druid has had to use other words?&quot;cave under his big stone
man-den&quot;--to convey that image. Of course, a druid not worried about being overheard
might mix the secret language and normal speech in a single sentence.
<P></P>
The secret language helps bind the worldwide druidic order together. Druids
from different circles (<A HREF="DD05062.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD05062.htm">See Chapter 3: The Druidic Order</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) or branches all speak the same secret language. However, they may have
developed their own regional accents or dialects. These could enable a listener to
identify the region the druid comes from, or provide a clue to the speaker's
branch.
<P></P>
In a Spelljammer? or Planescape? campaign and through the use of certain
spells and magical items, druids from different worlds can meet. The DM should
decide whether their secret languages resemble each other enough to allow
communication.
<P></P>
Finally, the druid's secret language, while private, is not
supernatural--theoretically, others can learn it. However, because the tongue provides druids
with code phrases or passwords, they simply <I>will not</I> teach it to nondruids. The great druid of the region will punish any who
break with this tradition.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Shapechanging
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Characters belonging to almost all druidic branches (discussed later in this
chapter) can shapechange into various animal forms upon reaching 7th level. For
more than the following guidelines, consult the description of a particular
branch's granted powers.
<P></P>
Normally, the druid can assume only a limited number of shapes each day,
depending on the character's branch; the choice of branch usually restricts the
types of forms the druid can assume.
<P></P>
Shifting shape takes one round, during which the druid cannot take other
actions. The druid can remain in the new shape indefinitely--the duration of a form
ends only when the druid turns back to the original shape or assumes another
one. A druid can shift from one shape to another without returning to human form
first.
<P></P>
Upon assuming a new form, the druid heals 10% to 60% (1d6-10) of all damage.
(Round fractions down.) For example, a druid who has suffered 15 points of
damage rolls a 3 on a d6. Therefore, the character regains 30%-15 hp, or 4.5 hp.
This value becomes 4 hit points after rounding.
<P></P>
The animal form a druid assumes can vary from the size of a bullfrog or small
bird to that of a black bear. Unless noted otherwise, the druid can assume only
the form of a normal (real-world) animal in normal proportions. A druid in
animal form takes on all the beast's physical characteristics movement rate,
abilities, Armor Class (AC), number of attacks, and damage per attack. The druid
retains original hit point and saving throw values.
<P></P>
The druid's clothing and one item held in each hand also become part of the
new body; these reappear when the druid resumes normal shape. Generally, a druid
in animal form cannot use such items, but in particularly challenging
campaigns, the DM may allow protective devices, such as a<I> ring of protection</I>, to function normally.
<P></P>
A shapechanged druid radiates strong Alteration magic.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Turning Undead
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
No druid has the granted power to turn undead. Such creatures are not of the
living world--the only world that concerns druids--so members of this class have
no control over them.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Higher-level Druids
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The worldwide organization of the druids allows for the existence of only a
limited number of 12th- or higher-level druids, assigning them special titles,
servants, and responsibilities. Druids who gain enough experience to reach 12th
level can advance only if they find a vacancy within the Order's ranks or wrest
a position from another druid through the challenge. (See Chapter 3: The
Druidic Order.)
<P></P>
Only one 15th-level druid exists in any campaign world: the Grand Druid, chief
of all druids in the world. The Grand Druid can come from any branch, though
on many worlds this position requires a member of the usually dominant forest
druids. A Grand Druid who retires and continues to gain experience can become a
hierophant druid, of which a world can have any number.
<P></P>
The rules for druids of 12th and higher levels described in the <I>PH</I> on pgs. 37-38 apply to all druidic branches. For more details on the
hierarchy of druids and the special responsibilities of higher-level characters, see <A HREF="DD05062.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD05062.htm">Chapter 3: The Druidic Order</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
