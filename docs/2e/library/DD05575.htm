<P></P>
This god is the mentor of a specific sentient race (dwarf, elf, gnome,
halfling, and human, and even half-elf if there enough half-elves that they are
recognized as being an actual species). Usually, the god is the one who, in the
legends, created the race in question -- or at least nurtured and educated the race
in difficult years.
<P></P>
Naturally, there is a separate race-god for each race.
<P></P>
The gods' priesthoods are dedicated to staving off threats against the race,
persuading members of the race to achieve their maximum potential and destiny,
and to preventing members of the race from betraying the race (or, for that
matter, the world, or all life on the world).
<P></P>
A race-god is as likely to be male as female.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Ancestors,
Birth/Children, Community, Culture, Good, and Marriage. Also: (Dwarves) Crafts,
Fire, Lightning, Metalwork, Thunder. (Elves) Animals, Crafts, Nature,
Race/Half-Elven. (Gnomes) Mischief/Trickery. (Half-Elves) Race/Elven, Race/Human.
(Halflings) Mischief/Trickery, Peace, Prosperity. (Humans) Divinity of Mankind,
Race/Half-Elven.
<P></P>
<B>Alignment:</B> The deity is good; at the DM's discretion, he may be chaotic good, neutral
good, or lawful good, but tends to be neutral good. Regardless of his alignment,
his priests may be of any good alignment. The flock may be of any neutral or
good alignment.
<P></P>
<B>Minimum Ability Scores:</B> Wisdom 12. Wisdom 16 means +10% experience.
<P></P>
<B>Races Allowed:</B> Only dwarves can be priests of the god of the dwarven race, only elves can be
priests of the god of the elven race, etc. The only exception to this pattern
is the half-elf. A half-elf can be a priest of the god of the elven race, of
the god of the human race, or of the god of the half-elven race (assuming that
the DM even <I>has </I>a god of the half-elven race). If a half-elf is the priest of the god of the
elven race, he follows all the guidelines (in this priest description) for those
priests instead of half-elven priests; if he is the priest of the god of the
human race, he follows all the guidelines for those priests instead of
half-elven priests.

<B>Other Limitations:</B> Whenever they appear in public, these priests must wear clothing or badges
which indicate their status as priests of the race. Important Note: There is no
limitation on whom these racial priests can heal. A dwarf-race priest can heal
anyone he chooses -- humans, half-elves, gnomes, halflings, even elves. Of
course, racial prejudice might prompt the priest to deny healing to those of another
race... but that's his individual choice, not a requirement of his faith.

(Half-Elf) Crossed Bow &amp; Sword; (Halfling) Low Hill With Windows; (Human) Crossed
Sword &amp; Shield or Spear &amp; Shield.
<P></P>
<B>Notes:</B> The DM can create many more racial priesthoods based on the above examples,
to reflect variations within races. He could have a racial priesthood for the
Aquatic Elf, similar to that of the Elf but using the weapons which the priests
of oceans and rivers can use. He could have another for the desert-dwelling
human where sabres, horse-back riding, desert survival and no armor are the order
of the day.
<P></P>
The DM should be careful when letting race-oriented priests in his campaign.
It's not difficult for new or inexperienced players to misinterpret this class
as a priesthood of prejudice, which is not the intent at all. These priests are
supposed to support and celebrate the virtues of their own race, but not to be
nasty to other races, contribute to stereotypes about them, exalt in jokes
about them, etc. There may be priests like that in any order, but they should be
NPCs who are not liked or appreciated by their fellows.
