There are numerous events that occur at any college. A few of the most common
are performances, practices, debates, dress rehearsals, collecting dues,
seminars, discussions, gatherings, and general meetings
<P></P>
Performances are given by one or more bards. These range from vocal solos to
dancing duets to an entire cast of actors putting on a play. Some performances
are restricted to audiences made up of friends or college members. Others are
open to the public and help fund the college. Every decent college has a stage or
other performance area, but many performances take place at the local theater
or in the village square.
<P></P>
All bards are performers of one sort or another, and no performer can elevate
his talents by study alone. Practice literally makes perfect for the skills of
a bard. Thus numerous practices are held at the college. Here, bards can play
before peers, gain the advice of a master, learn the latest techniques for
stringing a harp, and so on. If optional training rules are used, college is where
most bards train.
<P></P>
Since bards are romantic philosophers at heart, it is no small wonder that
debates frequently crop up. Subjects range from the proper way to pluck a mandolin
to the best philosophical alignment to hold when going through life. Although
debate is defined as a controlled discussion in which two or more sides air
their views, it is not uncommon for such debates to boil into heated arguments
ending when one side or another draws its weapons and threatens violence.
<P></P>
Before any professional production, a dress rehearsal must take place. This
bridges the gap between practices and actual performances. The intent is to run
through the entire performance without an audience or only a specially selected
audience. This enables the bards to judge the length of the performance and
make any last minute alterations. Occasionally, dress rehearsals are used as test
performances before a small sample audience. The purpose of this is to
determine if the subject matter is too volatile for the target audience.
<P></P>
Dues are usually collected as soon as a bard first enters a college. Typical
dues are an electrum piece plus 25% of all income the bard makes while
associating with the college (50% if the college is used to put on the performance). If
a bard doesn't perform or draws in only small crowds, he will be asked to leave
or contribute a platinum piece each week (his decision).
<P></P>
High-level bards often make money at colleges by planning seminars and other
events and charging a cover fee (usually a few silver pieces). Seminars are
events in which a small panel of bards (usually 1 to 3) presents information on
some predetermined topic. Seminars are learning events; those who attend expect to
have fun, learn something useful, and get a chance to ask questions of the
masters. Seminar audiences should always be at least two levels below those of the
panel. Thus, a bard must be at least 3rd level to put on a seminar.
<P></P>
Discussions are simply planned events in which a small- to medium-sized group
(3-10) of bards get together and discuss a topic. The subject can be
professional (acting techniques, how to clean instruments), relaxing (reminiscing about
the good old days), or philosophical (discussing the lifestyle of the pixie).
Discussions are very loose in format, and no one is necessarily in charge.
<P></P>
Gatherings are some of the most cherished events of a college. A gathering is
rarely a planned formal event. Rather, it occurs when several bards begin
talking about the same topic, such as the proper tempo for an epic poem. In other
words, gatherings are acquaintance meetings. Stories are swapped, tales told,
rumors shared, and laughs had by all. Occasionally a gathering is planned, such as
an early brunch or late evening ball.
<P></P>
Finally, no college would be complete without the general college meeting.
These are formal events held for the sole purpose of discussing the college, its
policies, future, and other functions. Some college meetings are mandatory; a
fine (1 sp) or penalty must be paid by those who do not show. Common topics
include assigning personnel to cleaning and cooking details, discussing methods for
advertising college performances, voting on whether or not to perform at a
local duke's wedding, and so on.
