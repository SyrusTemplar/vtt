The <I>lower water</I> spell causes water or similar fluid in the area of effect to sink away to a
minimum depth of 1 inch. The depth can be lowered by up to 2 feet for every
experience level of the priest. The water is lowered within a square area whose
sides are 10 feet long per caster level. Thus, an 8th-level priest affects a
volume up to 16 feet x 80 feet x 80 feet, a 9th-level caster affects a volume up to
18 feet x 90 feet x 90 feet, and so on. In extremely large and deep bodies of
water, such as deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and
similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave
by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water
elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a <I>slow</I> spell: The creature moves at half speed and makes half its usual number of
attacks each round. The spell has no effect on other creatures.
<P></P>
Its reverse, <I>raise water,</I> causes water or similar fluids to return to their highest natural level:
spring flood, high tide, etc. This can make fords impassable, float grounded ships,
and may even sweep away bridges at the DM's option. It negates <I>lower water</I> and vice versa.
<P></P>
The material components of this spell are the priest's holy (or unholy) symbol
and a pinch of dust.
