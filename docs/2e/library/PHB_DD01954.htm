When this spell is cast upon willing creatures of man-size or smaller, up to
10 such creatures per level of the caster can be magically altered to appear as
trees of any sort. Thus, a company of creatures can be made to appear as a
copse, grove, or orchard. Furthermore, these massmorphed creatures can be passed
through and even touched by other creatures without revealing their true nature.
Note, however, that blows to the creature-trees cause damage, and blood can be
seen.
<P></P>
Creatures to be massmorphed must be within the spell's area of effect;
unwilling creatures are not affected. Affected creatures remain unmoving but aware,
subject to normal sleep requirements, and able to see, hear, and feel for as long
as the spell is in effect. The spell persists until the caster commands it to
cease or until a <I>dispel magic</I> spell is cast upon the creatures. Creatures left in this state for extended
periods are subject to insects, weather, disease, fire, and other natural
hazards.
<P></P>
The material component of this spell is a handful of bark chips from the type
of tree the creatures are to become.
