</B>7. Share Responsibility </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A high-level campaign's vast scope is enough to overwhelm anybody who tries to
handle the task of keeping it running without help. Fortunately, high-level
campaigns usually come equipped with a cadre of talented and resourceful advisors
who can help-the players. In many cases, players are willing to help the DM
handle some of the basic background work, such as detailing unexplored areas,
developing histories and myths, and taking charge of NPC actions that don-t
directly involve their characters. At the very least, the players can help you focus
your creative energies so that you don-t waste time and effort on things that
don-t advance the campaign.
