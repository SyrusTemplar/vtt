<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Bruise Easily:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This disadvantage can be a real drawback for a character who spends a lot of
time in harm?s way. Every time the character suffers damage from a blunt
weapon, or a mishap such as a fall, he suffers 1 extra point of damage for each die
of damage rolled. This damage is not as long-lasting as normal damage,
recovering at a rate of 1 hit point per turn after the fight. However, if a character?s
hit points are reduced to zero, and some of the points of damage are bruise
damage, he is rendered unconscious but not dead?much like the damage inflicted by
punching.
