Within this book are many new rules, bard kits, suggestions on role-playing,
details of instruments, and new proficiencies. This information adds to the
rules presented in the <I>Player's Handbook</I> .
<P></P>
It is important to note that this book is a supplement to the <I>Player's Handbook</I>. All of the rules presented here are optional. As a player, you must have
your <I>Dungeon Master's</I> consent before using any of these new rules.
<P></P>
<I>The Complete Bard's Handbook</I> is a book of supplemental rules for adding depth, spice, and life to the bard
character class. However, even if your Dungeon Master should decide that none
of the rules within this book can used in his campaign, you can still gain a
lot by reading the pages that follow. Most of the important tables from the <I>Player's Handbook </I>(<I>e.g.,</I> level advancement, bard abilities, etc.) are compressed into one convenient
section within this book. It is also possible to mimic most of the new bard kits
within the existing bard class. This book answers many questions about bardic
abilities and presents an extensive list of instruments available to medieval
bards, along with illustrations. And, finally, this book has a lot of good
information to help gamers to better role-play their bard characters.
