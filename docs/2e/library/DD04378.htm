This powerful cooperative spell is rarely invoked since it requires the
concerted effort of six or more high-level priests. The casting effort severely
weakens the priests, discouraging casual use of this spell.
<P></P>
To cast the spell, six or more priests must be within a 15-foot radius. Each
priest must cast <I>spiritual wrath</I> at the same time. Before beginning the spell, the priests must decide upon
the area of effect. The spell causes 10d6+1d6 points of damage per priest casting
the spell. (The minimum damage, therefore, is 16d6.) Creatures within the area
of effect are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to reduce the damage to half.
<P></P>
The spell strikes as a great wave of force that descends from the sky. Small
objects must save vs. crushing blow. Structures suffer damage as if hit by a
heavy catapult (2d12). The force of this spell often raises a great cloud of dirt
and dust, obscuring the area for 1d4+1 rounds.
<P></P>
The spell's area of effect is determined by the number of casters. Each priest
contributes 10 feet to the radius of the spell. Six casters would create a
spell with a radius of 60 feet. No more than twelve casters can cooperate to cast
this spell (maximum of 22d6 damage and a 120-foot radius area of effect). This
converts to an 8-inch circle in the BATTLESYSTEM? rules ground scale.
<P></P>
The spell is difficult to cast, physically taxing the spellcasters so much
that each caster suffers 3d10 points of damage from the effort. There is no saving
throw allowed to avoid this damage.
