One of the newest discoveries from the great lands of the Forgotten Realms is
wild magic. Originally considered little more than the unfortunate by-product
of an epic struggle among the gods of that world, the strange effects of the
wild lands (as those areas affected by wild magic are known) have attracted the
attention of many a curious or scholarly wizard.
<P></P>
In general, two types of wizards are drawn to these strange areas. The first
are the researchers: wizards devoted to the study of the theoretical
underpinnings of magic. For them, the wild areas expose long-hidden secrets of the magical
universe and give new insights into how magical energy functions. From their
work have evolved the beginnings of a theory of random magic--one that defies
the traditional schools.
<P></P>
The second type of wizard drawn to the wild lands is far less rigorous and
methodical. These spellcasters are attracted by the sheer randomness and
uncertainty of the wild lands. Such mages seek to incorporate wild magic into their
spells by combining traditional magic with the new theories of random magic,
throwing in a dose of their own chaotic natures as an extra measure. These wizards
are the true wild mages who have been seen recently in various lands.
<P></P>
Although initially discovered and researched on Toril, the FORGOTTEN REALMSÂ®
campaign world, the art of wild magic has quickly spread to other places. Wild
mages, through teleporting, spelljamming, planar hopping, and even walking, have
carried the precepts of wild magic to lands and worlds far removed from Toril.
