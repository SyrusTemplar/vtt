<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Boots of Speed:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">These boots enable the wearer to run at the speed of a fast horsâ€”24 base
movement speed. For every 10 pounds of weight over 200 pounds, the wearer is slowed
by 1 in movement, so a 180-pound human with 60 pounds of gear would move at 20
base movement rate.
<P></P>
For every hour of continuous fast movement, the wearer must rest an hour. No
more than eight hours of continuous fast movement are possible before the wearer
must rest. Boots of speed give a +2 bonus to Armor Class in combat situations
in which movement of this sort is possible.
