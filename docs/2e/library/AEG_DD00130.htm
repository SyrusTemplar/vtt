The military fork is the warrior's version of a simple agricultural farming
tool. The head consists of two parallel spikes, often fitted with hooks for
pulling horsemen off their mounts. Certain versions of the fork have a blade mounted
just below the spikes. The wooden staff is about seven feet long.

Forks are useful not only as thrusting weapons, but as tools for climbing the
defender's ramparts, setting up ladders, and hoisting baskets of supplies.
