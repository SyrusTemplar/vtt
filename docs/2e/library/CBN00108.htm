This rare and horrible spell causes the victim to be slowly transformed into a
ravening, flesh-eating ghoul (see the description in the MONSTROUS MANUAL for
all about the lives of ghouls). The transformation process usually begins at
the limb or extremity (usually the hand or arm) closest to the location touched
by the caster at the onset of the spell. The victim suffers 1?2 hit points of
damage each round while the body slowly dies and transforms into a ghoul-s cold,
undying flesh.
<P></P>
The victim is entitled to an initial saving throw to resist this deadly
transformation. If failed, only a <I>limited wish</I>, <I>wish</I>, or <I>restoration </I>will end the condition. A <I>dispel magic</I> or <I>remove curse</I> may be effective, but only if cast within three rounds of the touch that
confers the <I>ghoul gauntlet</I>. During the early stages of the spell, the original afflicted extremity may
be severed and burned to terminate the spell.
<P></P>
If the extremity affected by the <I>ghoul gauntlet</I> is amputated while the victim has lost less than 20% of his or her total hit
points, then only a hand or a foot may need to be severed (inflicting 1d4+1 hp
of damage, requiring a system shock roll to remain conscious, and resulting in
the loss of the limb-s mobility and functions). After the victim has lost
20%?50% of his or her hit points, however, an entire limb will have to be cut off,
with the loss of 1d12+4 hp and a system shock roll. Initially, the transformed
flesh of the victim has no paralytic powers or any of the special abilities
associated with ghouls. As the spell unfolds, the advancing front of dying flesh
inexorably traverses the entire body, and the victim immediately dies once the <I>ghoul gauntlet</I> reaches the heart or brain (upon reaching 0 hp due to the spell). Healing
spells, potions, or magical items have no power to cure or reverse this affliction
while the <I>ghoul gauntlet</I> runs its course.
<P></P>
One full day after the victim has died (unless the remains are burned), the
subject awakens as a full-fledged ghoul as outlined in the MONSTROUS MANUAL. The
undead is now a fawning slave, utterly under the control of the necromancer who
cast the nefarious spell.
<P></P>
The material components include the freshly harvested fingernail of a corpse
and a pinch of mandrake root. Both of these are consumed by the casting of the
spell.
