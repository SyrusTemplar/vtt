<FONT SIZE="3">When this spell is cast, the wizard designates one
inanimate object of stone, earth, or metal within the spell&#146;s
range to function as a powerful magnet, attracting all metal. The
object affected can be no larger than a 10-foot cube, although a
section of wall, floor, or ceiling about 10 square feet will work.
Once magnetized, the object exerts a powerful attractive or repulsive
force (caster&#146;s choice) against objects of ferrous metal. The
effects vary by the proximity of the metal objects to the center of
magnetism, as shown below:</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3">The movement rate represents how fast objects are
drawn to or repelled from the center of magnetism. If the creature or
object in question is heavier than the magnetized item, the
magnetized item does the moving instead. The effective Strength is
the &#147;pull&#148; of the magnetism at that range; the size
equivalent refers to creature sizes, not weapon sizes. (All
human-sized weapons are considered small or tiny for this chart). A
character or creature carrying loose metal items or objects such as
weapons, shields, helms, buttons, and so on must win an opposed
Strength check (see <I>Player&#146;s Option: </I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><I><A HREF="CT_DD02671.htm">Combat
&amp; Tactics</A></I></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>for
information on opposed ability checks) in order to keep his
possessions from being wrenched out of his grasp by the magnetism.
Securing a weapon in its sheath, holding an item with both hands, and
other precautions may give the character a +2 to +4 to his base
ability score, at the DM&#146;s discretion.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Characters wearing metal armor must attempt an opposed
Strength check to ignore the effects of the magnetism. If the
character fails his Strength check outright, he loses his footing and
flies towards or away from the object at the full rate indicated. He
suffers full falling damage based on the speed with which he hits the
item&#151;1d6 for every 10 feet of the movement rate, or half that
damage if he is repelled and simply thrown back onto the ground. If
the character passes his Strength check but is beaten by the
magnetism roll, he is moved one foot for each point he lost by.
Again, some precautions or assistance may help iron-wearing
characters in their Strength checks. For monsters, compare the
creature&#146;s size to the effective size of magnetism.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">An armored character who is stuck to a surface or
object loses any Dexterity adjustments to AC and cannot make any
physical attacks. He can try to wriggle out of his armor and free
himself, employ a magical item, or use psionic powers if he has any
at his disposal.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>Lodestone the fighter is charging a wizard when the
dastardly felon </I>magnetizes <I>a sizable boulder about 30 feet
from Lodestone&#146;s present position. Lodestone carries a long
sword, a shield, and wears plate mail; he has a Strength of 17.
First, he checks to see if he holds onto his sword and shield, making
two opposed Strength rolls. He loses the shield, but keeps hold of
his sword. Now the DM checks to see if Lodestone resists the drag on
his armor. At 30 feet, the magnetism has a Strength of 18. Lodestone
rolls a 6, but the magnetism roll is a 12. Even though both Lodestone
and the magnetism made their Strength rolls, the magnetism roll is
higher than Lodestone&#146;s roll and does not go over its target
Strength score. As a result, Lodestone is dragged 6 feet closer to
it. Next round, Lodestone tries again and blows his roll altogether,
moving a full 10 feet closer. Now only 14 feet from the boulder, the
magnetism&#146;s Strength is effectively a 20, which means Lodestone
is in big trouble. If he blows his roll again the next round,
he&#146;ll go flying into the boulder at a rate of 20 feet/round,
which will inflict 2d6 points of damage.</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">If a creature wins its Strength check, it can ignore
the spell&#146;s effects and move out of the zone of influence normally.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>Sirellyn&#146;s superior magnetism </I>also affects
the passage of iron or steel missiles, such as steel-headed arrows or
quarrels. Any missile that passes through the zone of influence
suffers an attack penalty equal to the movement at the range
indicated. For example, if the path of an arrow brings it within 40
feet of a magnetized object, the attack suffers a &#150;5 penalty.
Finally, it is possible for the casting wizard to be affected by this
spell as well. As a result, the wizard had better make sure that
he&#146;s out of the effective area of effect when casting.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The material component for this spell is a small bar
magnet, bent into a U-shape and coated with mithral.</FONT></P>
