If you're wielding a polearm, you can parry an attack from another character
wielding a polearm, even if that character is attacking someone else. To do
this, you must be within range either of that attacker or his intended victim.
<P></P>
<I>Example: Amstard is wielding a halberd from behind the shield-wall his friends
are holding. Amstard announces, before initiative, that he'll use one of his
attacks for a Parry and the other for an attack. After initiative, an NPC with a
glaive takes a swing at Drusilla. Though the glaive-wielder is out of
Amstard's range, Drusilla is right in front of Amstard, easily within his range.
Amstard rolls his Parry, rolling against the glaive-wielder's AC, and hits; he
parries the attack. When it's time for the PCs to attack, Drusilla puts the
glaive-wielder down and Amstard swings his halberd against another enemy.
