Wherever any type of plant growth of moderate size or density is found, this
spell can be used. The ground-covering vegetation or roots and rootlets in the
area becomes very hard and sharply pointed. In effect, the ground cover, while
appearing to be unchanged, acts as if the area were strewn with caltrops. In
areas of bare ground or earthen pits, roots and rootlets act in the same way. For
each 10 feet of movement through the area, the victim suffers 2d4 points of
damage. He must also roll a saving throw vs. spell. If this saving throw is
failed, the victim's movement rate is reduced by 1/3 of its current total (but a
creature's movement rate can never be less than 1). This penalty lasts for 24
hours, after which the character's normal movement rate is regained.
<P></P>
Without the use of a spell such as <I>true seeing,</I> similar magical aids, or some other special means of detection (such as <I>detect traps</I> or <I>detect snares and pits</I>), an area affected by <I>spike growth</I> is absolutely undetectable as such until a victim enters the area and suffers
damage. Even then, the creature cannot determine the extent of the perilous
area unless some means of magical detection is used.
<P></P>
The components for this spell are the priest's holy symbol and either seven
sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point.
