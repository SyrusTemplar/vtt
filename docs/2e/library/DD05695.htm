<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the experiences of a ranger living
in an arctic wasteland may differ dramatically from one who makes his
home in a jungle, both have spent many years observing the patterns
of nature, and both have arrived at similar conclusions about the
relationship between living things and their environment.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; All rangers, then, have an inherent
understanding of natural lore, encompassing a broad set of principles
involving conservation, ecology, and natural order. Though not every
ranger knows specific details about particular situations, all of
them understand the general concepts at work. Some examples:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> The plant and animal
life in any given habitat tend to be interdependent. The butterfly
pollinates the flower, the flower produces nectar to feed the butterfly.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Animals and plants
adapt to natural changes in the environment. Grass becomes dormant in
the winter and grows again in the spring. A wolf's fur thickens as
the temperature drops, and thins when the weather becomes warmer.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> To avoid ruining the
land, natural resources used by man must be replenished. If trees are
harvested in a forest, new trees should be planted in their place.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A ranger's knowledge of natural lore
enhances his reverence for all living things. In practical terms, it
allows him to recognize ecological and environmental problems, both
actual and potential. In some cases, he may be able to offer
suggestions for correcting them.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no hard and fast rules for
determining the extent of a ranger's natural lore and its
application. The DM must decide how much a particular ranger knows on
a case by case basis, taking into account the ranger's training,
background, and primary terrain. In most situations, experience is
the main factor; the higher the ranger's level, the more he's likely
to know.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Table 31 provides natural lore guidelines
for rangers of various levels. The information is cumulative; a
7th-level ranger also knows the information available to lower-level
rangers. Keep in mind that these are generalizations; a 2nd-level
ranger who was raised on a farm may know as much about the ecology of
growing crops as another ranger of 10th level. By way of
illustration, the parenthetical comments indicate what the ranger
might know if attempting to figure out why crops no longer grow in a
once-fertile farmland.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3">If the DM is stumped as to whether a ranger knows a
particular piece of information, he may require the ranger to make a
Wisdom check, adding bonuses or penalties to the roll depending on
the relative difficulty of the question. For instance, knowing if a
particular substance will work as a fertilizer is a relatively easy
question, requiring no penalty to the roll. Knowing which specific
crops the fertilizer will nourish is a more difficult question, and a
penalty to the roll may be in order. In all cases, the DM should use
common sense. A ranger who's never been out of the desert won't know
much about the effects of a hurricane on a coastal environment,
regardless of his level.</FONT></P>
