<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Ring of Bureaucratic Wizardry:</B> This cursed ring is indistinguishable from a <I>ring of wizardry</I>, but has one important difference. When a wizard casts any spell while
wearing the ring, a sheaf of papers and a quill pen suddenly appear in his hand. The
papers are forms that must be filled out in triplicate explaining the effects
of the spell, why the wizard wishes to cast it, whether it is for business or
pleasure, and so on. The forms must be filled out before the effects of the spell
will occur. The higher the level of the spell cast, the more complicated the
forms become. Filling out the forms requires one round per level of spell.
<P></P>
As soon as the papers are filled out, the forms and the pen disappear and the
spell effects occur as the spellcaster desired.
<P></P>
The ring cannot be removed willingly. <I>Remove curse</I> or a similar spell must be cast upon the wearer in order to remove the ring.
