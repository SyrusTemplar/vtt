<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Several weapons have special properties that can be used to great effect by a
skilled wielder. The bolas, chain, harpoon, lasso, mancatcher, and net all have
special effects that can be used against opponents. The exact nature of each
weapon’s special maneuver is discussed in <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02743.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02743.htm.php.html">Chapter Seven</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
Generally, using a special weapon maneuver requires a called shot that delays
the wielder’s action phase by one step and gives him a –4 penalty on his attack
roll.
