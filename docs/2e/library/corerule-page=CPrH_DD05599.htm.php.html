<B>Description:</B> This priest is the priest of a culture halfway between what we think of as
civilized and savage. His people live at the very edge of or beyond the borders
of the edges of the campaign's main civilization. They tend to be very warlike,
fighting battles with neighboring tribes and with intruding imperial troops.
Their fighters aren't soldiers; they are warriors, and tend to be deadlier in
one-on-one fighting but poorer at formation combat than those of the &quot;civilized&quot;
nations. These warriors may, in fact, be <A HREF="corerule-page%3dCFH_DD05140.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dCFH_DD05140.htm.php.html">berserkers</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> (see <I>The Complete Fighter Handbook</I>). They are still more in touch with nature and the world than the people of
civilized lands. They may have very different customs from civilized folk.
<P></P>
Priests of this community perform the same functions as priests of civilized
lands. However, barbarians have more respect for the gods than civilized folk,
and priests also are well-respected. Kings and war-chiefs of their culture
listen to their counsel. In their culture, those who disagree with them do not
insult them or their guidance, and it is forbidden for a warrior to attack a priest
of his culture (though defending himself from attack is all right... if he can
prove that it was defense, not aggression).
<P></P>
There are no ability requirements to be a priest of a barbarian or berserker
tribe. The warriors of the tribe must have Strength 15, and priests will be most
impressive if they can approximate or match that score... but it's not a
requirement of the kit.
<P></P>
As with the Amazon, abandonment of this kit means that the character renounces
his allegiance to his tribe or clan and accepts citizenship in some other
culture. This means that he must now perform his priestly duties in the fashion of
the priests of that culture.
<P></P>
<B>Barred:</B> Barbarian tribes tend to have one or two patron gods, and most of their
priests will serve those gods. These tend to be gods of natural forces (Agriculture,
Animals, Darkness/Night, Earth, Elemental Forces, Fertility, Hunting,
Lightning, Metalwork, Nature, Sky/Weather, Thunder) or other barbarian attributes
(Strength, War). Gods of the &quot;softer&quot; attributes (Arts, Love, Music, etc.) would be
represented but their priests would be much rarer. No priesthood is barred
among the barbarians, however scarce.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> In the campaign, the barbarian priest is a spooky, dangerous figure. Like
barbarian warriors, he'll be grim and a little alien to his allies from civilized
lands. First and foremost, he's a defender of his people, and he'll most often
be found wandering in lands other than his own because of some quest set him by
the gods or some mystery he's encountered that requires him to travel in order
to solve it. When he finds his own tribesmen captured or enslaved in the outer
world, which might be a common occurrence, he must do his utmost to free them
and return them to his own land, which can imperil other goals he and his
player-character allies have . . . but as a leader and protector of his culture,
this is a duty he cannot refuse. (If he were to do so, the god would take it as a
betrayal of goals; see the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD05612.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD05612.htm.php.html">Role-Playing chapter</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">.)
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> The main occupation of the barbarian's tribe determines what sort of
secondary skill he knows. If the tribe raises and sells horses, then the Groom
secondary skill will be known by all tribesmen. Ask the DM what the tribe's main
occupation is and that will determine the required Secondary Skill.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Required: None. Recommended: Battle axe, sword/bastard, bow (any), sling,
warhammer. Naturally, the priesthood may limit the priest's choice of weapons and
not allow him to learn all these.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Bonus Proficiency: Endurance. Recommended: (General) Animal Handling, Animal
Training, Direction Sense, Fire-Building, Riding (Land-Based), Weather Sense,
Blind-Fighting, Hunting, Mountaineering, Running, Set Snares, Survival,
Tracking, Herbalism, Jumping. (Some of these are outside the priest's Nonweapon
Proficiency Group Crossovers and will cost twice the listed slots if taken; see the
description of the priest class, and the chart at the bottom of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>, <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01539.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01539.htm.php.html">page 55</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, for more details.) The DM may require this priest to take a proficiency in
the tribal specialty (Fishing, Agriculture, etc.).
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> With his starting gold, the barbarian priest cannot buy armor heavier than
splint mail, banded mail, or bronze plate mail. Once he has adventured in the
outer world, he can buy any type of armor his priestly requirements allow him to
use. With his starting gold, he can buy only weapons appropriate to his tribe
(usually battle axe, bows, club, dagger/dirk, footman's flail, mace, or pick,
hand/throwing axe, sling, spear, and swords); naturally, priestly restrictions may
prevent him from taking some of these, depending on which god he serves.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> Barbarians are imposing and dangerous-looking. This tends to make others
respect them or at least wish not to make enemies of them. Therefore,
barbarian/berserker priests receive a +1 reaction adjustment bonus when encountering NPCs.
This becomes a +3 among members of his own culture.
<P></P>
If the priest's culture has many Berserker warriors, as per <I>The Complete Fighter's Handbook</I>, the priest has an additional special ability. Berserkers normally take ten
rounds to go berserk; in the presence of one of their own priests, then can do
it in five. Additionally, if the priest, as part of his priestly class, has the <I>incite berserker rage</I> granted power, then berserkers of his culture in his presence can go berserk
in <I>one round</I>. The priest is not required to use his power for this to take place; it just
happens.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> The barbarian/berserker priest has a problem in civilized lands: He doesn't
respect the authorities and they have learned to be cautious of him. (This sort
of priest keeps freeing his enslaved brethren, and, even if he worships a god
known to this culture, he does so in a different way that the locals consider
wrong.) Therefore, the barbarian/berserker priest receives a -3 reaction
adjustment penalty when encountering NPCs in positions of power: Rulers, government
officials, etc.
<P></P>
<B>Wealth Options:</B> No special requirements; this priest gets the usual 3d6x10 gp as starting
money.
<P></P>
<B>Races:</B> There are no special restrictions here. Each individual DM has to decide
whether or not his demihumans can live in what are considered barbarian cultures.
If they can, then they will have priests among them.
