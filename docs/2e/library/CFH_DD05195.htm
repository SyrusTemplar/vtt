Here's a rule to give some advantage to those characters and parties (and
monsters) which always have ranged attacks ready.
<P></P>
When two groups first come within sight of one another at distances of 20 feet
or less (here a &quot;group&quot; can consist of only one person or creature, or can
have more), and <I>only one group has missile capability already in hand</I>, that group gets a &quot;free shot&quot; with its ranged weapons.
<P></P>
This isn't a full combat round, not a bonus round from surprise: It's a split
second of instinctive reaction on the part of the missile throwers in the
group. While they're firing, mages and priests can't cast spells, other characters
can't ready weapons. A knife expert can't draw a knife and throw it in this
split second; he can only throw it if he already has it in hand. In this
split-second, characters can take no action other than, perhaps, to talk or shout
something brief to one another.
<P></P>
Once that free shot is taken, on the first full combat round of the fight,
roll initiative normally. The party that was fired upon gets a +2 modifier for
being slightly disadvantaged by the enemy's missile superiority.
<P></P>
Remember that this option can only be taken when one side, and not the other,
has ready missile weapons (i.e., bows or crossbows in hand with arrows and
quarrels already nocked, or throwing weapons such as spears, javelins, axes and
knives already in hand). Also, the party which <I>can </I>take this option doesn't have to; the group does not have to fire upon another
person, group or monster the instant it sees its target. If the group chooses
not to, the opportunity is lost and the characters have the usual options to
talk to the other group; if they choose to fight, initiative is rolled normally.
The side without the missile weapons doesn't get the +2 modifier this time.
<P></P>
If the party is wandering around in conditions of poor visibility (such as a
dungeon), the DM can rule that the target is barely visible and that the party
cannot recognize many details about the target: &quot;Ahead of you in the corridor,
about 60 feet up, you see a group of human size silhouettes moving your way. As
you spot them, they spot you, too, and slow down. You can't tell what they are
. . .&quot; At this point, if the PCs have missile weapons and the NPCs don't, the
PCs can take this free shot, but are faced with the prospect of attacking an
unknown quantity. They <I>could </I>be firing upon the High King and his adventuring retinue, for all they know.
<P></P>
When two groups both have ready missile weapons, neither gets this option.
Roll initiative normally. (If two groups both have ready missile weapons, and one
group spots the other without the other group realizing it, that group wins
initiative, but doesn't get the &quot;free shot.&quot; Picture it this way: When the first
group looses its volley, the missilers of the second group immediately turn
around and loose theirs. So we're put in a position of normal combat.)
<P></P>
Finally, for this option, remember that spell-type missile abilities don't
count, but &quot;natural&quot; ones do. A dragon's breath acts as a ready missile weapon, as
do a manticore's tail-spikes. However, a gold dragon's spells don't count, nor
does a vampire's <I>charming</I>, for example.
