Generally, the higher the Hit Dice or level of the illusionary creature, the
more complex it is to convincingly create and the more likely it is for a
subject to disbelieve. An illusion of an ant is easier to create than the illusion of
a dragon. This also applies to illusionary NPCs--a 15th-level warrior is
harder to create than a peasant with 3 hit points. Similarly, the more creatures
included in the illusion, the harder it is to create; an illusion of 20 peasants
would be more difficult than a single peasant.
<P></P>
Illusions of active creatures are more difficult to create than illusions of
relatively inactive creatures. If the illusionary creature is executing a simple
action, such as standing still, polishing its sword, or grazing in the grass,
no special modifier for the subject's saving throw may be required. However, if
the illusionary creature is executing a complex series of actions, such as
singing a song while dancing and juggling, or attacking with two weapons while
shouting a war cry, a modifier may be in order.
<P></P>
If the illusionary creature is a generic monster or NPC--that is, it is a
&quot;typical&quot; orc or NPC warrior--there is no need for a special modifier for the
subject's saving throw. However, if the illusionary creature is a specific,
one-of-a-kind monster or NPC that the subject is familiar with--such as a friend of the
subject, or the subject's pet dog--the subject should receive a special
modifier.
<P></P>
As with the modifiers for inanimate objects, these factors are not
necessarily cumulative. Only in exceptional cases would an illusion result in a saving
throw modifier of more than +3.

Examples:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> An illusion of a single orc standing still, polishing his sword. Saving throw
modifier: 0. Nothing is particularly difficult about creating an illusion of a
single, low HD creature engaged in a relatively simple action.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> An illusion of King Sluz, the famous orc ruler, brandishing his five-pronged
trident, screeching a war cry, and leading a squad of six snarling orc soldiers.
Saving throw modifier: +3. The modifier assumes the subject is familiar with
King Sluz. Casting a believable illusion of a well-known NPC is always extremely
difficult, particularly when he is executing a complex action and is
accompanied by other creatures.
