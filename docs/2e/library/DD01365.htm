</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Breech Immunity: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Beginning at 21st level, a fighter using any weapon?including his bare
hands?can harm creatures that are normally hit only by +1 or better magical weapons.
The fighter does not actually get an attack or damage bonus but can harm
creatures such as a lycanthropes with any physical attack. This power is not magical
and is not diminished by factors such as planar distances or effects that
disrupt magic.
<P></P>
At 24th level, a fighter can harm creatures that are hit only by +2 or better
weapons. This ability increases to allow the fighter to strike creatures that
require a +3 weapon at 27th level, and by 30th level, the warrior can strike
creatures that require +4 weapons.

</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Intimidation:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A fighter of 21st level or higher has the ability to shake an enemy?s resolve
before combat begins. To use this ability, the fighter must be in plain sight
and close enough to see the opponent?s face clearly (10 yards if the visibility
is good). Use of this ability does not constitute an attack, nor is there any
initiative modifier.
<P></P>
Opponents with 4+1 Hit Dice/levels or less automatically retreat from the
confrontation. The creature does not flee in panic, but cautiously backs away.
Intimidated creatures seek to avoid any confrontation with the fighter for the rest
of the day. If the fighter or his party attacks, the creature is free to
return the attack, suffering the penalties as detailed below.
<P></P>
If the opponent has more than 4+2 hit dice/levels, it is entitled to a saving
throw vs. death magic to escape the effects. If the saving throw is failed, the
creature can opt to retreat from the fighter or remain in the area, in which
case it suffers a ?2 penalty on all initiative, attack, saving throw, and
ability check rolls as long as the fighter remains within 60 feet of the creature.
The creature is free to leave the area to avoid the effects, launching missile
attacks or directing other activities, but the penalties return once the creature
gets within 60 feet of the fighter.
<P></P>
As a fighter increases in level, he becomes increasingly more intimidating.
For every three levels that the fighter gains after receiving this ability, the
opponent saves at an additional ?2 penalty. Thus, after achieving 24th level,
opponents save at ?2, at 27th level </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="3">the penalty</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> increases to ?4, and a 30th-level fighter inflicts a ?6 saving throw
adjustment.
