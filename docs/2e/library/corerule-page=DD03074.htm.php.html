trail—a useful aid to gaining food in a non-civilized setting. Given proper
materials—supple branches, bowstring or heavy thread—the character can make two
snares in an hour without a proficiency check. The character can check the snares
after eight hours, rolling a proficiency check for each. These checks can be
modified by +2 if the character has the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03023.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03023.htm.php.html">animal lore</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> proficiency, and an additional +2 for the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03092.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03092.htm.php.html">animal empathy</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> trait. Success means that a small animal, such as a rabbit or partridge, has
been snared. The checks can be modified up or down by the DM, to reflect the
population of animals in the area.

The character can create a larger snare, such as a pit trap, by making a
proficiency check. An 8' deep, 6' square pit requires at least eight hours to make
if the ground is soft and a decent shovel is available. Rocky ground, larger
pits, and makeshift equipment can increase this time dramatically. Whether
anything falls into the large pit is a matter of the DM’s interpretation and
generosity.
