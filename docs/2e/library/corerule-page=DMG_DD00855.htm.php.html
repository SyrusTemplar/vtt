spells, and one of which is unique:
<P></P>
<B>• </B><I>Dancing lights:</I> The wand produces this effect at a cost of one charge.
<P></P>
<B>• </B><I>Light: </I> The <I> illumination </I> wand sends forth light at an expenditure of one charge.
<P></P>
<B>• </B><I>Continual light: </I> This function require two charges.
<P></P>
<B>• </B><I>Sunburst:</I> When this effect is called forth, the wand delivers a sudden flash of
brilliant, greenish-white light, with blazing golden rays. The range of this sunburst is 120 yards maximum, and its duration
is 1/10 of a second. Its area of effect is a globe of 40-foot diameter. Any undead within this globe suffer 6d6 points of
damage, with no saving throw. Creatures within or facing the burst must roll successful saving throws vs. wands or be
blinded for one round and be unable to do anything during that period. (Of course, the creatures in question must have
sight organs sensitive to the visible light spectrum). The function requires three charges.
<P></P>
The wand can be recharged.
