<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Chime of Hunger:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This device looks exactly like a <I>chime of opening.</I> In fact, it will operate as a <I>chime of opening</I> for several uses before its curse is put into operation.
<P></P>
When the curse takes effect, at the DM's discretion, striking the chime causes
all creatures within 60 feet to be immediately struck with ravenous hunger.
Characters will tear into their rations, ignoring everything else, even dropping
everything they are holding in order to eat. Creatures without food immediately
available will rush to where the <I>chime of hunger</I> sounded and attack any creatures there in order to kill and eat them.
<P></P>
All creatures must eat for at least one round. After that, they are entitled
to a saving throw vs. spell on each successive round until they succeed. At that
point, hunger is satisfied.
