The priest casting an <I>augury</I> spell seeks to divine whether an action in the immediate future (within
one-half hour) will benefit or harm the party. For example, if a party is
considering the destruction of a weird seal that closes a portal, an <I>augury</I> spell can be used to find if weal or woe will be the immediate result. If the
spell is successful, the DM yields some indication of the probable outcome:
?weal,? ?woe,? or possibly a cryptic puzzle or rhyme. The base chance for
receiving a meaningful reply is 70%, plus 1% for each level of the priest casting the
spell; for example, 71% at 1st level, 72% at 2nd, etc. Your DM determines any
adjustments for the particular conditions of each augury.
<P></P>
For example, if the question is ?Will we do well if we venture to the third
level?? and a terrible troll guarding 10,000 sp and a <I>shield +1</I> lurks near the entrance to the level (which the DM estimates the party could
beat after a hard fight), the augury might be: ?Great risk brings great
reward.? If the troll is too strong for the party, the augury might be: ?Woe and
destruction await!? Likewise, a party casting several auguries about the same action
in quick succession might receive identical answers, regardless of the dice
rolls.
<P></P>
The material component for an <I>augury</I> spell is a set of gem-inlaid sticks, dragon bones, or similar tokens of at
least 1,000 gp value (which are not expended in casting).
