<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Before a duel begins, both of the participants should have a copy of the
dueling plot (provided on the opposite page for you to photocopy). There are two
basic parts to the diagram: the positioning symbols and the attack and defense
lists.
<P></P>
At the beginning of each round of a duel, the attacker and defender both
secretly choose their strategies of attack, defense, and position. The attack and
defense forms are represented by numbers on a concealed die; the attack form uses
a d12 and the defense a d6. The lists on the dueling plot indicate which forms
are available and what effects and adjustments apply. The position symbols are
used to indicate how the duelist moves <I>defensively</I> in the round.
<P></P>
To set up a maneuver, each player first takes the defensive die (the d6) and
chooses a defense form, then positions it in the space desired. Next, an attack
form is selected on the attack die (the d12). Note that not all attack forms
are allowed with every defensive maneuver. The numbers in the position spaces
indicate which attack choices are valid with that kind of defensive movement.
After all, it’s pretty hard to perform a close attack on someone when you’re
leaping back. Finally, the attack die is positioned where the duelist anticipates his
opponent will go.
