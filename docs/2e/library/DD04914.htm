If his or her burrow and its attendant company and comforts are the most
important features of a halfling's life, why then would any halfling leave this
perfection for a life of short rations, crude lodging, exposure to bad weather,
danger, and possible violence?
<P></P>
That's the question asked by most of the rest of a village when a young
halfling packs his or her tote bag and waves goodbye to his or her parents. His or
her neighbors will often gather to see the would-be adventurer off, watching the
already small form grow smaller in the distance, knowing there's a good chance
that they'll never see their friend again.
<P></P>
There are nearly as many answers to this question as there are halflings who
have walked down that road. Some do so reluctantly, out of a sense of duty.
Others find the temptations of excitement, adventure, and treasure too great to
ignore. One thing almost all of them share in common, however, is that they lack
the characteristic halfling dread of faraway places.
<P></P>
For reasons which once again are unknown halflings call it 'the legacy of
Littleman'--a few rare halflings are born entirely free of the condition which
keeps their fellows tied to their homes. Instead, they are filled with an endless
curiosity to see new places, new people, and new things. Usually this wanderlust
fades later in life and the homing instinct reasserts itself, but a few
halflings remain wanderers for the rest of their days (see the Traveler kit in the
next chapter). These restless individuals are considered 'eccentric' by their
fellow halflings, but their exploits are often admired just the same.
<P></P>
Some examples of the specific callings of halflings who leave their villages
behind are discussed in the next chapter.
