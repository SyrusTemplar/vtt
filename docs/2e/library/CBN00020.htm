<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The Deathslayer devotes his or her life to the
destruction of undead, striving always to rid the living world of
their abominable existence. By mastering the Art, a wizard gains a
greater understanding of these creatures which are neither fully
living nor entirely dead. The Deathslayer&#146;s militant opposition
to all forms of undead frequently places him or her in direct
conflict with other necromancers, such as the Archetype and the
Undead Master, who delight in creating zombies, skeletons, ghouls,
and other undying monstrosities.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">As Deathslayers gain power and experience, however,
they eventually seek out increasingly dangerous undead, namely
ghosts, vampires and liches. Not surprisingly, few survive for long
in their chosen profession.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">In addition to various <I>Van Richten&#146;s Guides</I>,
the original Dr. Van Helsing (on whom Van Richten&#146;s character
is based) from Bram Stoker&#146;s<I> Dracula</I>, and Parl Dro, the
Ghost-Killer from Tanith Lee&#146;s <I>Kill the Dead</I>, are sources
of inspiration for this kit. The popular comic-book hero Batman
provides an interesting example of the Deathslayer&#146;s
personality. As a child, Bruce Wayne&#146;s parents were murdered by
street thugs, inspiring him to devote his life to combating
criminals. As a hero, Batman never killed the &#147;bad guys&#148;
(he may have smacked them around a bit, but he never killed them).
The interesting thing about Batman&#146;s character, of course, is
that he <I>wants</I> to kill all the evil villains he defeats. He
craves revenge, but must continually fight an inner struggle to
master his darker desires.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The theme of evil (or a twisted form of good) fighting
evil has become increasingly popular in modern fantasy. Michael
Moorcock&#146;s Elric of Melnibone, perhaps the first fantasy
anti-hero, makes pacts with evil gods and employs black necromancy to
save his beloved, only to inadvertently slay her with an malevolent
artifact. In the recent film <I>The Crow</I>, the revenant is little
different from his murderers, whom the vengeful spirit hunts down and
brutally kills. Ultimately, nothing prevents the Deathslayer from
adopting the same loathsome practices as his or her enemies.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Requirements:</B> While it might seem that only
good characters would be attracted to this kit, in reality, it is
open to wizards of all alignments who seek combat or revenge against
undead. In addition to the usual 9 Int and 16 Wis, a wizard must have
a 13 Str to become a Deathslayer.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Spell Preferences:</B> Since these necromancers
tend to be involved in countless battles, they prefer offensive and
defensive spells (see Appendix Three), especially those that detect
or disable undead, such as <I>corpselight, </I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><I><A HREF="CBN00048.htm">chill

<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Role:</B> At some time in their lives, almost all
Deathslayers have experienced a terrifying attack by some form of
undead, either directed against them personally or a loved one or
family member. The celebrated Van Richten, for instance, lost both
his parents to a vampire, inspiring him to become the famous
&#147;Vampire-Killer&#148; of Ravenloft. Indeed, the vast majority of
Deathslayers are driven by strikingly similar motives: an
overpowering desire for revenge, mixed with righteous indignation and
a good dose of moral superiority.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Of course, the Deathslayer need not be such a
tormented and macabre individual. A lawful good ghost hunter, for
instance, may view this terrible, yet strangely honorable profession
as laying disturbed spirits to rest, releasing them from their
bondage to the physical world. The character&#146;s actions are
motivated by compassion and selfless sacrifice, not hatred or revenge.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">On the other hand, the Deathslayer need not have a
such developed sense of morality. Neither is the wizard required to
be entirely sane. After all, the Deathslayer&#146;s most common enemy
is undead. Who needs to be merciful, kind, or sane when habitually
dealing with such abominations?</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">A real moral dilemma arises when undead are attended
by a living master (usually another necromancer) or other living
monster. Will the Deathslayer use black necromancy to destroy these
living beings along with the undead? Unless the Deathslayer has a
pure and noble heart, the path of righteous vengeance can quickly
lead to great evil, madness, and despair.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Talib the Lich-Killer, whose detailed NPC sheet
appears in Chapter Nine, is a heroic necromancer, possibly serving as
a memorable role model for necromancer heroes in the campaign. Talib
is a wily old Deathslayer&#151;an interesting potential ally for an
unbalanced party. Talib is also mentioned in the Introduction,
Chapters Two and Three. In Chapter Nine, an adventure hook including
Talib further illustrates the potential role of a Deathslayer in the campaign.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> The Deathslayer may learn
any of the standard wizard&#146;s weapons (the dagger, dart, knife,
sling, and staff).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Required: necrology.
Recommended: (General) any; (Warrior) hunting, set snares, tracking;
(Priest) any; (Wizard) ancient history, astrology, herbalism,
languages (ancient), netherworld knowledge, reading/writing,
religion, spellcraft, spirit lore. Forbidden: all Rogue.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Equipment:</B> Though they may not wear armor,
Deathslayers may otherwise choose any other type of equipment which
will help them in their battles against the enemy.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Special Benefits:</B> At the start of his or her
career, a Deathslayer chooses a single type of undead against which
to focus his or her efforts. Typical choices include the mummy,
spectre, banshee, ghost, vampire, or lich (lesser, more easily
defeated undead make for unchallenging nemeses at higher levels).
This choice of an enemy is permanent and cannot be changed during the
wizard&#146;s life.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The Deathslayer gains powerful benefits when fighting
his or her chosen undead enemy:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>Mental Fortitude:</I> Because of the wizard&#146;s
extensive study and preparation, the Deathslayer gains a +2 bonus on
saving throws against mental attacks (if any) caused by the Enemy,
including <I>charms</I> and <I>fear</I>.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>Battle Prowess:</I> The Deathslayer also gains a +2
bonus on attacks against the enemy. This applies not only to melee
weapons, but also touch-delivered spells and undead-specific special
attacks (such as a driving the stake through a vampire&#146;s heart
or, in the case of Talib, destroying a lich&#146;s phylactery).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>Spell Prowess:</I> The Deathslayer targets spells
effectively against the Enemy, subjecting this type of undead to a
&#150;2 penalty on saving throws. This applies to all spells cast by
the Deathslayer on the chosen undead and is cumulative with the usual
&#150;1 penalty applied to necromancy (thus, the selected enemy makes
saves at &#150;3 vs. the &#145;slayer&#146;s necromantic spells, and
at &#150;2 vs. spells from other schools).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Special Hindrances:</B> The Deathslayer never
relents in the pursuit of the enemy. This fanatical wizard is driven,
as if by compulsion or <I>geas</I>, on an endless quest to seek out
and destroy undead. In combat, a Deathslayer like Talib will always
seek out and destroy undead in preference over living targets. If the
wizard encounters a mixed group of undead and living creatures (like
an Undead Master with a contingent of skeletons), he or she will deal
with the undead opponents first, even if they pose less of a threat.
A Deathslayer who willingly ignores this kit responsibility
automatically forgoes any experience points he or she normally would
have gained for the encounter (or adventure).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The obsession to eradicate undead borders on mania,
and a few members of this kit are not the sanest of individuals. The
horrors of continually battling powerful undead can erode the mental
health of even the most strong-willed heroes. Even if they retain a
fragile hold on their sanity, Deathslayers are usually harsh and grim
in their dealings with others.</FONT></P>
