Paladins are rare, in part because of the statistics of dice rolling and in
part because paladinhood is an exacting road for characters to follow. It is easy
to err and fall from the special state of grace required. Not every character
is up to these demands, but those few that are can be truly special. You will
not find units with thousands, hundreds, or even tens of paladins. At best, they
form small groups (such as the Twelve Peers of Charlemagne or some of the
Knights of the Round Table).

Often, because of the sterling example they set, paladins lead others in
battle. But, at the same time, they tend to be ill-suited to the task of ruling,
which too often requires compromise of one's principles. It is common to find the
paladin working in association with the clergy of his religion, but lone
paladins, carrying their faith into the wilderness, also appear in the tales of bards.
