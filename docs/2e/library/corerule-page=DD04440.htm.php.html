<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Powder of the Black Veil:</B> This sooty, black powder causes temporary magical blindness to all those in
the area of effect. If a creature's saving throw is successful, he suffers no
effects. If the roll fails, the creature is blinded and suffers a -4 penalty to
attack rolls, a -4 penalty to Armor Class, and a +2 penalty to initiative rolls.
Blindness persists each round until the victim succeeds at a saving throw vs.
spell, at which time the effect is instantly negated. An entire packet or blow
tube must be used for each application.
