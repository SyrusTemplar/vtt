?? The following magical items are intended for rangers, but if the DM so
chooses, he may allow fighters, wizards, and other character classes to use them, too.
All of these items are relatively rare and should turn up no more often than a
typical item listed in the Miscellaneous Magic Tables in Appendix 2 of the<I> DUNGEON MASTER Guide</I>; if you like, you may use any of these items as an option when a DM's Choice
is rolled.

?? Chameleon</B> <B>Cloak.</B> This lightweight cloak, which covers the wearer from neck to foot and also
includes a hood, may be worn comfortably over studded leather or lighter armor.
The color of the cloak automatically changes to blend in with the surrounding
terrain. If the wearer enters a jungle, the cloak becomes mottled with patches of
green and brown. If the wearer enters a plain of snow, the cloak turns white.
At night, the cloak becomes black. The color changes are instantaneous.
<P></P>
?? A <I>chameleon cloak</I> allows a character to be personally camouflaged, as if using the camouflage
proficiency, in any terrain. The <I>chameleon cloak</I> can only conceal one person at a time. The cloak conceals with an effective
Wisdom equal to its rating.

?? <B>Horn of Animal Calls (1200XP).</B> This wooden instrument, painted bright red with tiny silhouettes of various
animals along the sides, resembles a recorder about six inches long. The
instrument can duplicate the cries and calls of any animal. The user closes his eyes,
pictures the animal in his mind, then blows into the instrument. The sound is
indistinguishable from the cry of the actual animal. The instrument can be used
to call particular animals or frighten them away. The DM determines the effect
of any particular use of the horn; for example, summoning 2d4 animals might be
80% likely in an animal's home terrain, with an arrival time of 1-4 rounds.
<P></P>

??<B> Ice Box (800 XP).</B> This is an airtight box one foot square, made of black metal with a single
hinged panel. Opening the panel reveals the hollow interior. Centered on the
outside of the panel is a white metal pointer resembling a small arrow. This
pointer can be rotated in any direction to regulate the temperature inside the box.
If pointed straight up (toward the hinges), the temperature remains at 70
degrees F. For every complete clockwise rotation of the arrow, the temperature inside
the box drops 1 degree. Therefore, if the arrow is rotated 30 times, the
temperature drops to 40 degrees F. Rotating the arrow counter-clockwise raises the
temperature 1 degree per rotation. The temperature can't be lowered below zero
degrees or elevated beyond 70 degrees. The box is useful for making ice and
preventing food spoilage.
<P></P>
<P></P>
??<B> Portable Shadow (1,000 XP).</B> Similar in appearance to a <I>portable hole</I>, a <I>portable shadow</I> resembles a gauzy black circle about 10 feet in diameter that can be folded
up into a packet about 6 inches square. When unfolded and laid on any horizontal
surface, the <I>portable shadow</I> looks like any normal area of shade, as dark as a shadow cast by a tree or
other solid object under a midday sun. This magical item is useful for
concealment and makes as good a hiding place as any naturally shaded area; rangers,
thieves, and others have their normal chance of hiding in shadows when standing in a
portable shadow. The shadow can be picked up by lifting the edge and folding
it like a tablecloth.
<P></P>
?? Dungeon Masters should use common sense adjudicating the use of a <I>portable shadow</I>. If a character attempts to use it to hide in shadow while crossing a
featureless plain, the presence of a &quot;black hole&quot; attached to nothing will be more
likely to attract attention than to divert it. However, it can provide a shady
place to cool off away from the desert sun.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Species Enemy Medallion (750 XP).</B> A character wears this copper disk on a chain around his neck and under his
clothing so that the metal touches his chest. When the character comes within
100 yards of his species enemy, the medallion becomes warm, alerting him to the
enemy's presence. The intensity of the warmth varies according to the number and
proximity of the enemy. The medallion doesn't get hot enough to cause damage,
nor does it reveal the exact location or number of enemies in the vicinity.
<P></P>
<P></P>
?? <B>String Cage (500 XP). </B>This looks like a piece of white thread 20 feet long, flecked with gold. When
arranged in a circle so that the ends touch, the <I>string cage</I> creates an invisible barrier that prevents any creature contained inside from
leaving. The invisible barrier has the strength of a <I>wall of force</I> and has the shape of a closed cylinder about 6' tall. The <I>string cage</I> only functions if placed on the ground or other solid surface; if moved, the
barrier dissipates. Because of its light weight, the string can't be thrown
like a lasso; if rocks or other weights are attached, its magic is negated.
Therefore, the device is mainly useful to contain creatures that are sleeping,
trapped, restrained, or cooperative.
<P></P>
?? A <I>string cage</I> can contain any single creature, so long as the creature fits inside the
circle. Physical attacks and most spells have no effect on a string cage. The
creature trapped inside can't move it. A <I>disintegrate</I> spell destroys the device, as will a<I> rod of cancellation</I> or a <I>sphere of annihilation</I>. A creature contained in a string cage can escape by using dimension door,
teleport, or a similar spell.
<P></P>
?? Only the person who originally formed the circle can separate the ends and
free the creature inside. Otherwise, a <I>string cage</I> lasts for 3-12 (3d4) hours, at which time the ends separate automatically. A<I> string cage</I> can be used only once per day.
<P></P>

<B>Thorn of Sleep (100 XP each).</B> The <I>thorn of sleep</I> looks like the thorn of a plant, about three inches long. It is dry and
smooth to the touch. If pricked by the thorn, a creature must make a saving throw
vs. paralyzation. Failure means the creature falls into a deep slumber. The
creature will not waken until attacked or strongly roused. Noises, even those of
battle, will not awaken the sleeping creature. Each thorn can be used but once.
Only 1-8 thorns will be found at any one time. A <I>thorn of sleep</I> can be projected by a blowgun.
