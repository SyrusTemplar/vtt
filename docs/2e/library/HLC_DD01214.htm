</B>Linking Adventures </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The best way to establish an epic flavor to your campaign is to create
adventures that are related, one flowing from another.
<P></P>
Linked adventures give the impression of unseen forces at work at work in the
campaign. They also give player characters chances to help determine their own
fates as their accomplishments?or lack thereof?carry forward from one adventure
to the next.
<P></P>
All that is required to link adventures together is an overall theme or
extended plot that runs through all the adventures. A careful look at any set of
adventures usually reveals several such themes or plots. Likewise, there are
several different methods you can use to turn separate adventures into a series.
