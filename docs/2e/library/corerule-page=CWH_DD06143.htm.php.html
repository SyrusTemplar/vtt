<B>Character Description:</B> The Brooder is tormented with self-doubt; he worries about his relationship
with the rest of the universe, where he fits in with the rest of mankind, and
the meaning of his own existence. He may dwell for days on the ramifications of
some seemingly insignificant action. If he makes a wrong decision or a decision
he perceives as being wrong, he may become consumed with self-loathing,
spiraling into a deep depression that can persist for weeks. Holding himself to
impossibly high standards, the Brooder is continually disappointed with his
performance as a wizard, a citizen, and as a human being.
<P></P>
Obsessed with perfection, the Brooder tends to be an extremely skilled spell
caster and combatant. His mind is sharp and his actions are precise and correct.
Although he usually succeeds at whatever he attempts, his accomplishments seem
to bring him little fulfillment or joy.
<P></P>
Not surprisingly, the Brooder's outlook on life is dismal. He believes the
struggle between good and evil can never be won; it will continue to claim victims
on both sides for all eternity. Friendship is valued but transient; a friend
today can be an enemy tomorrow. Acts of courage and selflessness are admirable
but ultimately futile. Existence is a tragic joke-- men are only puppets in the
hands of incomprehensibly cruel gods.
<P></P>
Because the Brooder seldom voices his opinions, this personality is a good
choice for players who tend to be quiet. Conversely, the Brooder is a nice change
of pace for players who normally take charge.
<P></P>
<B>Best Suited For:</B> Because the Brooder tends to reject moral absolutes, he gravitates toward
neutral alignments, particularly neutral good and chaotic neutral. The Brooder can
use any kit, but the Academician, the Mystic, and the Wu Jen are especially
good choices.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>In Combat Situations:</B> The Brooder is an excellent fighter. Cowardice is unknown to him; since he
doesn't believe his own life is particularly precious, he fights as if he has
nothing to lose. He is calm and clear-thinking in times of crisis, using his
spells to their maximum effectiveness. If necessary, he will unhesitatingly risk his
life for a friend.
<P></P>
If the Brooder is preoccupied with a past mistake or a depressing
philosophical revelation, he may be slow to join a battle. Likewise, if the Brooder is in a
state of mind where the differences between good and evil seem especially
ambiguous, he may decline to participate in a fight. Usually the Brooder can be
roused to battle by a firm request from the party leader or the gentle urgings
from a trusted companion. Even in the depths of despair, the Brooder will not
stand idle and allow harm to come to his companions.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>In Role-Playing Situations:</B> In most encounters with NPCs, the Brooder will remain quiet and distracted,
leaving most of the talking to his companions. He is loathe to offer his
opinion, and seldom cares to hear the opinions of others. Most of the time, he is
simply apathetic. Most NPCs perceive the Brooder to be emotionless and preoccupied,
and keep their distance. Sensitive NPCs might feel sorry for him.
<P></P>
The Brooder's attitude can be extremely frustrating to his fellow player
characters. Since he keeps to himself most of the time, usually his companions will
only be able to guess what he's thinking or feeling.
<P></P>
Some PCs may attempt to befriend him. Kindness and patience will eventually
break through a Brooder's shell. Although he may not show it, the Brooder feels
friendship deeply, and may even share his deepest thoughts with a companion who
has been kind and caring
