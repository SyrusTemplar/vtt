The same is not true of dual-class characters.
<P></P>
If a character starts off as a warrior, he may take any of the Warrior Kits
above. If, later, he decides to change classes according to the normal Dual-Class
Benefits and Restrictions rules, he doesn't lose any of the benefits or
hindrances of the Kit he chose; he is still that sort of fighter. If that second
character class also has a range of Kits available to it, he <I>may not choose a new, additional Kit.
<P></P>
</I> If a character starts off as some other character class, does not take on a
Kit appropriate to that class, and then later switches to one of the warrior
classes, he can choose a Warrior Kit at that time . . . though the DM may insist
that certain campaign events be accomplished in order to allow him to do this.
<P></P>
For instance, let's say that a human mage decides, later in life, to become a
Fighter, and he wants to be a Gladiator. Well, there's nothing wrong with that.
But the DM should insist that the next several adventures deal with that
transformation. The character must be hired by (or, alternatively, captured and
enslaved by) an arena or fighting-stable owner, trained, and pitted against other
Gladiators. The other characters in the campaign could also be entering the
gladiatorial arena, or the DM could contrive things so that the current adventure
involves gladiatorial elements and still get all the PCs involved.
<P></P>
To better simulate the wait involved for the character to learn his new trade,
the DM is within his rights to insist that the character not receive his
Warrior Kit until he's reached second experience level in his new class.
