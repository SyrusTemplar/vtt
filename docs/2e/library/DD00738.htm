<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Oil of Timelessness:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">When this oil is applied to any matter that was once alive (leather, leaves,
paper, wood, dead flesh, etc.), it allows that substance to resist the passage
of time. Each year of actual time affects the substance as if only a day had
passed. The coated object has a +1 bonus on all saving throws. The oil never wears
off, although it can be magically removed. One flask contains enough oil to
coat eight man-sized objects, or an equivalent area.
