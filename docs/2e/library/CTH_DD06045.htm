Obviously, NPCs are a major part of any social campaign environment. For a
campaign with major roles for thieves, this must be one of the primary areas of DM
concern.
<P></P>
Details are important, as always. Because of the number of NPCs needed, DMs
will probably want to develop a convenient shorthand procedure for keeping track
of all these characters. It is not necessary, for example, to include stats and
proficiencies and equipment for each shopowner and innkeeper in the player
character orbit. Often a name for the character and a one or two word personality
description will suffice to give the DM all he needs to roleplay the NPC in an
interesting and consistent manner. (Remember, if the innkeeper is &quot;greedy and
bigoted&quot; the first time the PCs encounter him, he is likely to be that way next
time as well.)
<P></P>
Of course, NPCs who might logically be expected to enter combat with the PCs
(guards, rival thieves, thugs, bullies, etc.) will need to be detailed with the
relevant combat information. Other NPCs who fill the roles of the potential
targets for PC thievery (merchants, nobles, dandies, caravaners, fences,
influential criminals and thieves, etc.) will need additional information on valuables
possessed, how those goods are secured—including notes on locks, traps, secret
compartments, and the like—as well as enough combat information to allow the DM
to quickly adjudicate an encounter should matters come to blows.
<P></P>
Chapter Twelve of the AD&amp;D® 2nd Edition DMG includes valuable information on
defining the personalities of NPCs (<A HREF="DMG_DD00604.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00604.htm">pg.114</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) and on creating fast, realistic characters when needed (<A HREF="DMG_DD00611.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00611.htm">pgs.115-117</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">).
<P></P>
The DM, after working out an easy way of recording his NPCs, must then keep
this information close at hand where it can be easily referenced. He is then
ready for any encounters the characters might decide to find.
<P></P>
A variety of NPCs is every bit as important as the detail used to record them.
In all campaigns, the player characters will interact with folks from all
walks of life—in a thief campaign such interaction is common and expected.
<P></P>
Some of the NPCs will need to be peers of the PCs—fellow thieves and rogues
inhabiting the same area. These NPCs can serve as rivals, temporary helpers,
sources of information, and even sort of a measuring scale for the PC's successes.
<P></P>
Thieves will often develop contacts with NPCs even lower in status than the
thieves themselves. These characters can include beggars, urchins and orphans,
harlots, and other low-life types. A stable of these NPCs can provide the PCs
with a ready source of information (&quot;Here's a copper, kid—go and count the guards
outside the storehouse for me!&quot;), as well as providing a touch of believability
to the campaign background. These low-life NPCs will, of course, have the same
variety of personalities and abilities as other NPCs. Because the PCs
represent persons of power to them, however, player character actions can have a great
rebounding effect in their relations. For example, a thief that always shares a
(however small) portion of his take with the gang of urchins constantly
roaming the neighborhood will find those urchins to be useful lookouts and helpful,
willing sources of information. The thief who spends his time cursing and
kicking the youngsters away from his abode may just find them leading an elite unit
of the city watch straight to his door.
<P></P>
Potential targets for robbery include a whole vast realm of NPCs: wealthy
merchants, powerful nobles, influential foreigners, even thieves and other
adventurers who have enjoyed a certain amount of financial success in their endeavors.
A variety of characters is essential here because this gives the PCs the
opportunity to determine for themselves what will be the site of the next furtive
operation.
<P></P>
Here your group might try pacing the gaming sessions to give the players
complete freedom of choice, while not burdening the DM with the task of detailing
every mansion, noble house, and merchant shop in town. Simply use the expedient
of closing a gaming session with the PC planning meeting for the next operation.
Then, when the target for the theft has been selected, the DM has the next
week (or next few hours, depending on how often you play) to prepare a detailed
layout of the setting.
<P></P>
No campaign is complete without at least one, or ideally several, strong
villains to serve as antagonists for the player characters. Villains, of course, do
not have to be criminals or other low-life types. They can be nobles,
government officials, law enforcement officials or magistrates, foreign ambassadors,
powerful wizards or sinister clerics—in short, all types of characters can make
good villains in a thief campaign. And don't overlook the grandmaster of the
thieves guild or some other powerful criminal who might be a rival of the PCs;
these kinds of long-running feuds can kindle the fires of many an extended campaign
adventure.
<P></P>
Whoever the DM picks as a central villain for the campaign, a few general
principles apply. The villain must be a powerful character—one who can inspire
fear, or at least grudging respect, in the PCs. Power can be expressed in financial
resources (an estate, fortress, collection of treasures, etc.), authority
(such as a troop of guards or command of the city watch), personal abilities (such
as magic powers, magical artifacts, combat skill and weaponry, or sheer
intelligence or charisma), or, ideally, some combination of all these characteristics.
Certainly in order to seem formidable, a villain's power must exceed the
combined power of the PCs.
<P></P>
Scenes involving the villain should be paced and staged carefully—the PCs
probably will not find him in a back alley rolling drunks. (If they do, that should
tell them something about the drunk!) Villains, being powerful and influential
individuals, are not stupid. When they are encountered, they will usually be
surrounded by their lackeys and henchmen (some of these can be quite stupid, at
the DM's option).
<P></P>
In fact, the villain's lackeys should be common antagonists of the player
characters throughout the campaign. It is well worth a DM's time to develop some of
these henchmen as detailed NPCs—minor villains in their own right. What is the
Sheriff of Nottingham without his loyal house guards, after all?
<P></P>
Any villain worth his black mustache will have one or two escape routes
planned from every location where he is likely to be encountered. These will only be
used in emergencies, of course, but can serve an important campaign function in
that, as a villain escapes from near-certain death time after time, the
players will develop their own motivation in wishing to go after him and end the
conflict once and for all. This resolution, ideally occurring after many gaming
sessions, then becomes a major triumph in the PCs' careers. Of course, if they
blow it, the last battle can make a glorious final chapter in a PC career . . .
<P></P>
A final category of NPCs, impossible to overlook in the thief campaign, are
those characters entrusted with the enforcement of law, or justice, or
power—whatever prevails in your campaign environment. Even should you have created an
anarchistic society, people will take steps to protect their belongings and some
of these steps usually involve big, tough fighters.
<P></P>
It is interesting and enjoyable to have several of these characters become
very well-developed NPCs in the campaign. The gruff sergeant-major of the city
watch, for example, might have a few stern words for the PCs each time they are
apprehended. A villainous thug in charge of a platoon of mercenary guards might
develop a personal grudge against the PCs that can grow into a major campaign
storyline. Even a severe magistrate can be a recurring character, especially if
PC lawbreakers are coerced into helping the forces of justice in exchange for
their freedom, lives, or whatever.
<P></P>
The DM need not go overboard on details for these NPCs. After all, having 100
NPCs in the campaign isn't much use if the DM has to shuffle 100 pieces of
paper every time a player character asks a question. It is best to work out to your
own satisfaction the level of detail required for consistent, enjoyable play,
while allowing a brief enough format that the DM does not become overwhelmed
with recordkeeping and NPC creation.
