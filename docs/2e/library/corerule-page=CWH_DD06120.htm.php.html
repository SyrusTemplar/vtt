Wizard kits are entirely optional-- a wizard character can easily get along
without one. But a player who wishes to add detail to his wizard should choose a
kit when the character is first created. Only one wizard kit can be chosen for
a character.
<P></P>
It is possible to incorporate these rules into existing campaigns, providing
the players and the DM can agree on which kits are appropriate. A kit must be
compatible with a character's past actions, his background, and his established
personality traits. For instance, if a diviner has been played as a thoughtful
man of reason with a history of preferring negotiation to combat, and the
player has made it clear that his character is from a sophisticated urban culture,
it doesn't make sense to assign him the Savage Wizard kit.
<P></P>
Once a particular kit has been assigned to a character, it cannot be changed.
However, the character can later abandon it if he wishes, giving up all
benefits and hindrances. Bonus proficiencies (see below) are not forfeited. Instead,
such proficiencies are no longer considered to be bonuses. The former bonus
proficiencies are set aside until the character acquires new proficiency slots; at
that time, the new proficiency slots are filled by the former bonus
proficiencies.
<P></P>
When designing a new character, first determine the character's ability
scores, race, specialization, and alignment.
<P></P>
Once these elements have been decided, choose a kit for the new character.
After choosing the kit and recording the information on the character sheet,
continue with the character's proficiencies, money and equipment, and other
pertinent information.
