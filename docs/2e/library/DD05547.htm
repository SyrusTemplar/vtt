<P></P>
This deity represents all godly attributes. He is usually the god of a
monotheistic culture, and is either (a) the creator of all the world and the only true
god in existence, or (b) a powerful god who demands that everyone accept him
as the only real god and intends to demote all other gods to the status of
lesser demons, devils, or servants-beings.
<P></P>
Priests of this god seek to convert all the world to the worship of this god.
They persuade whole populations that all other gods are false, or lesser
beings. They sometimes agitate for and initiate wars so that conquered populations
may be reeducated in this doctrine. In such times, they are much like priests of
Culture.
<P></P>
This god is just as likely to be male as female. If male, he'll probably have
some sort of sky aspect; if female, she'll have an earth aspect.
<P></P>
The priests of this god can, at the DM's discretion, be on good terms with the
priests of the philosophies of the Divinity of Mankind and Good, for these are
philosophies and not gods. The priests of this god dislike the priests of all
other gods, and also hate priests of the philosophy of Evil.

play clerics take this priest-class instead.
