<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Forge of Metal Protection:</B> The first of these heavy (1,000 lb.) forges was created an unknown number of
centuries ago. Because of the specific magical properties involved, it is
believed that a wizard, assisted by a number of dwarves (all of whom were interested
in planar research), constructed the device. Although the secret of the
construction has since spread, the forge is an extremely rare magical item.
<P></P>
The forge is a furnace made up of enchanted rocks held together with a network
of steel rods. When metal armor and weapons are placed within the furnace and
heated to glowing red, the armor becomes immune to the effects of heat on the
inner planes. All metal items tempered in this manner suffer no ill effects from
heat on any of the inner planes, but suffer the effects of heat normally on
the Prime Material plane.
<P></P>
The effect of the magical protection lasts 12 to 30 days (2d10+10). Magical
armor or weapons that are placed in the forge take on the protection from heat,
but temporarily lose their other magical properties. Thus, a <I>sword +</I>2 placed in the forge will not melt on the plane of Fire, but it ceases to
functions as a <I>sword +</I>2 until the enchantment wears off. A weapon with an ego retains its ego, but
loses all of its other magical properties.
