Knowing which spell to employ at any given time and creating the greatest effect for
one’s effort is a skill that can be learned with practice and experience. A
wizard with the tactics of magic proficiency can attempt a proficiency check to
gauge the range to a target, estimate how many enemies will be caught in a given
area of effect, or determine whether or not he may be in danger of a rebounding <I>lightning bolt </I>or a <I>fireball </I>cast in too small a space.
<P></P>
In addition, a character with this skill may recall subtle effects or
interactions that are not immediately apparent. For example, if the wizard is about to
cast <I>magic missile </I>at an enemy wizard protected by a <I>shield </I>spell, the DM may allow the player a proficiency check to see if he suddenly
recalls that the <I>magic missile </I>will fail—especially if the wizard also knows shield, but the player has just
forgotten about the special effects of the spell. However, if there’s no way
the character could know of a special immunity or property of a monster, spell,
or magical item, this proficiency will not be of any help.
