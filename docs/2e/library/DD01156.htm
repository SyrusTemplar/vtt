No matter how intelligent the creature is, any opponent of high-level PCs
should be as prepared as possible to face the party. Unintelligent creatures
undoubtedly have another force that tells them what to do, and this behind-the-scenes
antagonist makes sure that any discernible weaknesses have been minimized.
Against high-level PCs, few allies are expendable—the villain must make sure that
each ally has a specific purpose.
<P></P>
As DM, it is your responsibility to make sure that the PCs’ enemy has
adequately prepared for any confrontation. Obvious weaknesses, such as a rakshasa’s
susceptibility to a blessed crossbow bolt, should should be shielded from the PCs.
Perhaps the rakshasa has read a <I>scroll of protection from magic</I>, or is protected by a <I>minor globe of invulnerability</I> when the PCs attack. Some additional examples follow:

<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Fire and acid are troll’s worst enemies because they prevent the troll from
regenerating (see the troll entry in the <A HREF="MM_DD04079.htm#7b8baad4"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="MM_DD04079.htm#7b8baad4">Monstrous Manual™</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">). A troll’s regeneration ability also has a delay; the creature regains no
hit points until three rounds after it suffers its first wound.

trolls and dousing them with flaming oil.

melee might just suffer an arrow hit that starts its regeneration before it
begins suffering really heavy damage from the party’s warriors.

<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Vampires suffer from diverse vulnerabilities that players know all too well:
sunlight, garlic, mirrors, holy symbols, turning by priests and paladins, and
running water.

and snatch away holy symbols.

hurt them at all, and a clever vampire might use standing water as a hiding
place to ambush overconfident PCs.

<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Giant slugs are wildly inaccurate when they first use their acidic spit in an
encounter, and they have a terrible Armor Class.

must approach it through a narrow opening or constricted passage.

Perhaps it lies on the far side of a crevasse or behind a portcullis or other
barrier.

In many cases, you also have to find ways to explain why a creature enjoys the
advantages it has for the situation you have constructed. Remember that the
PCs might want to incorporate some of your ideas into a defensive aid for their
own keeps and castles. Keeping the PCs’ alignments in mind, your rulings—for or
against—should be consistent.

<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Perhaps a member of the troll’s group is a <I>polymorphed</I> or <I>reincarnated</I> wizard who is making the best of a bad situation by brewing potions for her
companions.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The explosive gases are a naturally occurring event in that region. An
alchemist could reproduce the explosive for the PCs, but it would be expensive.

<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Vampires have the intelligence and longevity to dream up all manner of special
defenses and contingency plans. Did someone say <I>contingency</I>?
<P></P>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Perhaps the giant slug is another creature’s pet or guardian. The portcullis,
which the slug might easily batter down, is coated with a thick layer of salt
that discourages the monster from pushing against it except in one place that is
just large enough to accommodate its head.
