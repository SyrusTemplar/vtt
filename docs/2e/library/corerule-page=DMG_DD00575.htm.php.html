Unlike other expert hirelings, sages are experts in a single field of academic
study. They are most useful to player characters in answering specific
questions, solving riddles, or deciphering ancient lore. They are normally hired on a
one-shot basis, to answer a single question or provide guidance for a specific
problem. A sage's knowledge can be in any area that fits within the limits of
the campaign. Typical sage areas are listed on <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD00576.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD00576.htm.php.html">Table 61</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> .
