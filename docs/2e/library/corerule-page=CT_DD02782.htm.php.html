The area around a castle usually provides clear lines of fire out to the
maximum range of the castle’s defensive weapons. For example, a castle equipped with
light ballistae offers a clear line of fire out to 330 yards. The encounter
range is always the same as the maximum missile range.

Footing around a castle varies with the terrain. A castle built on a plain has
good footing. Mountain castles are surrounded by rocky slopes (2/3 or 1/3
movement when going uphill), forest castles tend to be surrounded by masses of
stumps where trees have been cut to provide clear lines of fire (1/3 movement).

Cover is generally not available to creatures attacking a castle once they
enter maximum missile range, regardless of the quality of the footing.

A castle’s walls present an obvious obstacle to attackers. In addition,
castles often are surrounded by ditches or moats, usually from 10 to 20 feet deep.
