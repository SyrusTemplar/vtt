</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Concentration: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A character with this talent has rigorously trained himself to ignore
distractions of all kinds, deadening his mind to pain or sensation. This allows a
wizard to ignore annoyances or disturbances that might otherwise interfere with the
casting of a spell. In order to use this ability, the player must state that
his character is concentrating when he begins to cast a spell. If the character
is struck by an attack that causes 2 or less points of damage, he is permitted
to attempt a proficiency check to ignore the distraction and continue to cast
his spell (unless, of course, the damage is enough to render him unconscious.)
The wizard can try to ignore grappling or restraining attacks that cause no
damage but suffers a â€“4 penalty to his check. Spells that incapacitate without
damaging, such as <I>hold person </I>or <I>command</I>, still interrupt the caster if he fails his saving throw.
<P></P>
A character using this ability must focus on the casting of his spell to the
exclusion of all other activity, even direct attacks. Any Dexterity adjustment
to his Armor Class is lost, and in addition flank or side attacks are treated as
rear attacks, with a +2 bonus to hit instead of a +1.
