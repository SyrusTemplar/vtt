Theoretically, every action has a particular moment at which it will have its
greatest possible effect. Using the arcane mathematics of this spell, the
priest can determine the &quot;ideal moment&quot; for any single action in each round that the
spell is in effect. This action must be performed by a character other than
the priest.
<P></P>
In practice, another character informs the priest of an action he wants to
undertake in a round. The priest concentrates on the action, then informs the
character when the &quot;correct moment&quot; has come. The character then gains a bonus of
20% (+4 on a d20) to the success of his action. The spell can affect only a
single action in a given round. When used in combat, the priest can advise the best
moment to initiate an action (affecting initiative) or what moment offers the
greatest success in striking (affecting the chance to hit).
<P></P>
If the character seeks advice concerning initiative, he gains a -2 modifier to
the initiative roll, but only at the cost of -2 on his chance to hit.
Characters who seek the best attack frequently delay their actions. These characters
suffer a +1 on their initiative roll but gain a +4 on their chance to hit. The
spell cannot affect the amount of damage caused, since the act (striking) has
already succeeded at that point.
<P></P>
Characters are not obliged to wait for the moment specified by the priest. For
example, a fighter might decide that striking first is more important than
gaining +4 to hit. The character can act normally, based on his or her unmodified
initiative. The character gains no bonus from the <I>moment</I> spell, and the priest can affect no other action in that round.
<P></P>
Noncombat actions can also benefit from the <I>moment</I> spell. For example, a thief planning to climb a wall may wait to start her
climb until the priest informs her that the moment is right. If she waits, she
gains a bonus of 20% to her Climb Walls roll (in this case, the bonus is
subtracted from her roll).
<P></P>
While concentrating on this spell, the priest can take no other action. A
break in the priest's concentration--taking damage in combat, for
example--terminates the spell instantly.
<P></P>
The material component is a set of three silver dice, which the priest tosses
in his hand while concentrating on the spell. The dice are not consumed in the
casting.
