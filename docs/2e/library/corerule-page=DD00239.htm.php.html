Bards are rare and, like thieves, tend to be adventurers, but for somewhat
different reasons. They do occasionally violate the law and find it necessary to
move on to the next town--and the next adventure--but more often they are driven
by curiosity and wanderlust. Although some bards settle down in a town or
city, most travel from place to place. Even &quot;tamed&quot; bards (as the settled ones are
sometimes called) feel the urge to go out and explore, gather a few more tales,
and come home with a new set of songs. After all, the entertainment business
demands variety.

There are generally no bard guilds or schools, no colleges, societies, or
clubs. Instead, bards sometimes band in secret societies, loose affiliations that
allow them to improve their art while maintaining an aura of mystery.

Most frequently, however, bards rely on the informal hospitality of their
kind. Should one bard arrive in the town of another, he can reasonably expect to
stay with his fellow for a little while, provided he shares some of his lore and
doesn't cut into his host's business. After a time, during which both bards
learn a few of the other's tales and songs, the visitor is expected to move on.
Even among bards it is possible to overstay one's welcome.

Of course, there are times when a bard decides not to leave but to set up shop
and stay. If the population is big enough to support both bards, they may get
along. If it isn't, there will almost certainly be bad blood between the two.
Fortunately, though, one or the other can usually be counted on to get
wanderlust and set out on some great, new adventure. Bards do tend to be incurable
romantics, after all.
