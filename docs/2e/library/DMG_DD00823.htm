<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Rod of Lordly Might:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This rod has functions that are spell-like, but it can also be used as magic
weapons of various sorts. It also has several more mundane uses. The <I>rod of lordly might</I> is metal, thicker than other rods, with a flanged ball at one end and various
studs along its length. It weighs 10 pounds, thus requiring 16 or greater
Strength to wield properly (-1 penalty to attack rolls for each point of Strength
below 16).
<P></P>
<P></P>
The spell-like functions of the rod are:
<P></P>
<B>? </B><I>Paralyzation</I> upon touch, if the wielder so commands
<P></P>
<B>? </B><I>Fear</I> upon all enemies viewing it, if the wielder so desires (6-foot maximum range)
<P></P>
<B>? </B><I>Drain</I> 2d4 hit points from a touched opponent and bestow them upon the rod wielder,
up to the rod wielder's normal maximum.
<P></P>
Each function draws off one charge from the rod. The functions entitle victims
to saving throws vs. spell, with the exception of the draining function
above-this requires a successful hit during melee combat.
<P></P>
<P></P>
The weapon uses of the rod do not use charges. These are:
<P></P>
<B>
<P></P>
? </B><I>mace</I> +2
<P></P>
<B>? </B><I>sword of flame +1</I> when button #1 is pushed. A blade springs from the ball; the ball becomes the
sword's hilt. The weapon shortens to an overall length to three feet.
<P></P>
<B>? </B><I>battle axe +4</I> when button #2 is pushed. The sword blade springs forth, and the handle can
be lengthened up to 12 feet, for an overall length of from 6 feet to 15 feet. In
15-foot length, the rod is suitable for use as a lance.
<P></P>
<P></P>
The mundane uses of the rod do not use charges. These are:
<P></P>
<B>
<P></P>
? </B>Climbing pole. When button #4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in granite is
extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens 5 to 50 feet in a single round,
stopping when button #4 is pushed. Horizontal bars three inches long fold out from the sides, one foot apart, in staggered
progression. The rod is firmly held by spike and hooks and will bear up to 4,000
pounds weight. It retracts by pushing button #5.
<P></P>
<B>? </B>The ladder function can also be used to force open doors. The rod's base is
planted 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced and is in line with it. The
force exerted is equal to storm giant Strength.
<P></P>
<B>? </B>When button #6 is pushed, the rod will indicate magnetic north and give the
possessor a knowledge of his approximate depth beneath the surface (or height above it).
<P></P>
<P></P>
The <I>rod of lordly might</I> cannot be recharged. When its charges are exhausted, spell-like functions
cease, as do all weapon functions except the <I>mace +2.</I> The rod continues to work in all other ways.
