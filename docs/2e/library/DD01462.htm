</B> The principal attribute of a fighter is Strength. To become a fighter, a
character must have a minimum Strength score of 9. A good Dexterity rating is highly
desirable.
<P></P>
A fighter who has a Strength score (his prime requisite) of 16 or more gains a
10% bonus to the experience points he earns.
<P></P>
Also, high Strength gives the fighter a better chance to hit an opponent and
enables him to cause more damage.
<P></P>
The fighter is a warrior, an expert in weapons and, if he is clever, tactics
and strategy. There are many famous fighter from legend: Hercules, Perseus,
Hiawatha, Beowulf, Siegfried, Cuchulain, Little John, Tristan, and Sinbad. History
is crowded with great generals and warriors: El Cid, Hannibal, Alexander the
Great, Charlemagne, Spartacus, Richard the Lionheart, and Belisarius. Your
fighter could be modeled after any of these, or he could be unique. A visit to your
local library can uncover many heroic fighters.
<P></P>
Fighters can have any alignment: good or evil, lawful or chaotic, or neutral.
<P></P>
As a master of weapons, the fighter is the only character able to have weapon
specialization (explained in <A HREF="DD01522.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01522.htm">Chapter 5</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). Weapon specialization enables the fighter to use a particular weapon with
exceptional skill, improving his chances to hit and cause damage with that
weapon. A fighter character is not required to specialize in a weapon; the choice is
up to the player. No other character class--not even ranger or paladin--is
allowed weapon specialization.
<P></P>
While fighters cannot cast magical spells, they can use many magical items,
including potions, protection scrolls, most rings, and all forms of enchanted
armor, weapons, and shields.
<P></P>
When a fighter attains 9th level (becomes a “Lord”), he can automatically
attract men-at-arms. These soldiers, having heard of the fighter, come for the
chance to gain fame, adventure, and cash. They are loyal as long as they are
well-treated, successful, and paid well. Abusive treatment or a disastrous campaign
can lead to grumbling, desertion, and possibly mutiny. To attract the men, the
fighter must have a castle or stronghold and sizeable manor lands around it. As
he claims and rules this land, soldiers journey to his domain, thereby
increasing his power. Furthermore, the fighter can tax and develop these lands, gaining
a steady income from them. Your DM has information about gaining and running a
barony.
<P></P>
In addition to regular men-at-arms, the 9th-level fighter also attracts an
elite bodyguard (his “household guards”). Although these soldiers are still
mercenaries, they have greater loyalty to their Lord than do common soldiers. In
return, they expect better treatment and more pay than the common soldier receives.
Although the elite unit can be chosen randomly, it is better to ask your DM
what unit your fighter attracts. This allows him to choose a troop consistent
with the campaign.
<P></P>
The DM may design other tables that are more appropriate to his campaign.
Check with your DM upon reaching 9th level.
<P></P>
A fighter can hold property, including a castle or stronghold, long before he
reaches 9th level. However, it is only when he reaches this level that his name
is so widely known that he attracts the loyalty of other warriors.
