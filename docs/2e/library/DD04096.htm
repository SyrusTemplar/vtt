Once human, yuan-ti histachii are near-mindless abominations who have been
transformed into reptilian humanoids to serve their yuan-ti masters. Most often,
they are found guarding yuan-ti brood chambers.
<P></P>
Histachii are hairless creatures. Their clothing, little more than filthy
rags, hangs limply over their emaciated bodies. Their gray or yellow-green skin is
tough and scaly, and smells faintly of rotting meat. They have beady, bloodshot
eyes, and their forked tongues continually dart in and out of their mouths.
Their dull yellow teeth are like tiny hooks, razor-sharp. Their fingernails are
black and twisted, resembling the claws of a lizard.
<P></P>
Histachii speak in short, hissing phrases. They know the languages of yuan-ti
and all snakes and snakelike creatures, as well as the languages they spoke in
their original human lives.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Histachii attack any nonreptilian creature or humanoid on sight, unless their
yuan-ti masters give them orders to the contrary. Unsophisticated fighters,
most histachii charge directly at their opponents, attacking with their claws and
teeth. To protect their yuan-ti masters, histachii will fight to the death.
<P></P>
Regardless of their abilities in their former lives, histachii do not wield
weapons or use magic. Once per day, they can become <I>berserk</I>. In this state, they are so enraged that they gain a +2 bonus to their attack
rolls. The <I>berserk</I> condition persists for 2-12 (2d6) rounds.
<P></P>
Unlike yuan-ti, histachii have no natural magic resistance. However, they are
immune to all types of <I>hold</I> and <I>charm</I> spells.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Yuan-ti create most histachii servitors from human prisoners. They also may
transform human worshippers who voluntarily agree to become histachii. Humans
become histachii by drinking a distillation of yuan-ti venom mixed with certain
herbs and roots. (The yuan-ti prepare this special concoction.) If a human is
unwilling to drink, the yuan-ti pin their captive to the ground and pour the
mixture down his throat.
<P></P>
Any human who drinks this mixture, whether by choice or by force, must make a
saving throw vs. poison with a -4 penalty. If the saving throw fails, the
victim becomes a histachii in 7-12 (1d6+6) days. If the save is successful, the
victim immediately lapses into a coma; death will follow in one hour. A comatose
victim can be revived with a <I>slow poison</I> or <I>neutralize poison</I> spell, presuming the spell is cast within 1 hour after the mixture has been
swallowed. Human-headed yuan-ti have the ability to <I>neutralize poison</I>, and they may save a comatose victim themselves. It is not for the victim's
benefit. A human who fails his save after drinking the mixture may suddenly find
himself alive again, only to face another flask of the mixture when the
yuan-ti attempt another transformation.
<P></P>
Only humans can become histachii. Nonhumans who drink the yuan-ti mixture must
also make a save vs. poison with a -4 penalty, however. If the save is
successful, the nonhuman will be violently ill, unable to take any action for 1-4
turns. If the save throw fails, the nonhuman becomes comatose and dies in 2-5
rounds.
<P></P>
If a human fails his saving throw after consuming the mixture, a few desperate
measures may prevent his transformation into a histachii. If <I>neutralize poison, dispel magic, remove curse</I>, and <I>heal</I> are cast on the victim, in precisely this order, the transformation process
will be reversed. However, the victim will permanently lose 1 point of
Intelligence. A <I>wish</I> or a <I>limited wish</I> will reverse the transformation with no loss of Intelligence. Once the
transformation is complete, only a <I>wish</I> can restore the victim to his former self. Histachii live 20-80 (2d8 x 10)
years after their creation. They cannot breed; histachii only can be created from
human beings.
<P></P>
Histachii are completely submissive to their yuan-ti masters, carrying out
their every order without hesitation. The servants share the lairs of their
yuan-ti masters. Usually, these lairs are in ancient ruins deep in tropical jungles,
but sometimes yuan-ti dwell in subterranean caverns beneath human cities. A
histachii's duties include hunting, caring for the yuan-ti's reptile menageries,
guarding prisoners, and various custodial chores. In rare moments of leisure,
the servants enjoy soaking in pools of cool water. Histachii do not collect
treasure.

other vermin. They also eat yuan-ti leftovers.
