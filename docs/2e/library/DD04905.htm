<I>&quot;As pleasant as his burrow was, Littleman often felt there was something
missing as he sat alone by his hearth. It wasn't long before he realized that he was
lonely, and it wasn't long after that till he knew he'd found the perfect
person to cure his loneliness--Melindy, the fairest maiden among all his neighbors,
she of the plump, red cheeks, bouncing curls, and smoothest downy fur on the
tops of her feet. But, as luck would have it, she was already being courted by
another--stolid Genrill, a farmer and herdsman of good wealth and solid standing
in the community.
<P></P>
&quot;Naturally, Genrill objected to his newfound rival but--alas for
him--Melindy's heart was swept away by the dashing Littleman, with his tales of travel and
adventure, his ready laugh, and his warm smile.&quot;
<P></P>
&quot;But Grandmother--did Genrill not fight for his love? Didn't he bash Littleman
over the head . . . or something?&quot; wondered Kepli.
<P></P>
&quot;Posh, child--you talk like a human! Of course he didn't. Melindy made known
her choice, and she became Littleman's bride. Genrill himself provided the roast
beast for the wedding feast!&quot;

Though they have no lack of courage, halflings shun violent or aggressive
behavior in social settings. They are slow to anger and always ready to seek a
negotiated solution to any dispute.
<P></P>
A halfling feels no sense of shame if he or she chooses to leave the presence
of some obnoxious bully rather than getting involved in a fight--even a fight
the halfling thinks he or she can win. Fortunately, because of their communal
village upbringing, few halflings are this rude, and such situations mainly arise
when the halfling mixes company with humans, dwarves, or goblinoids.
<P></P>
Personal insults delivered to a fellow villager are considered low class,
reflecting more poorly on the one who makes the insult than the target. Politeness
is much admired, and one who shows tolerance to a neighbor who has wronged him
is considered to be the epitome of a class act.
<P></P>
Parties among halflings are common and will be given for a variety of reasons.
Birthdays are always cause for celebration, and with so many family members
living together it's rare for a month to go by without several birthdays in it.
Each community will also have many annual holidays. These vary by culture--there
are no such holidays observed by halflings everywhere. Often the Small Folk
will celebrate whatever festivals are popular among their human and demihuman
neighbors, soon giving these observances a character all their own.
<P></P>
The hosts of a party are expected to provide food and drink--but much of this
will be contributed by neighbors prior to the event. Thus, none of the guests
show up with anything to contribute, but they've all provided a bottle, a wedge
of cheese, loaf of bread, or the like beforehand. Indeed, this is one way
halflings get invited to parties--if you find out that your neighbor is celebrating
his birthday, for example, take over a small jug of ale in the morning and he
can hardly turn you away when the festivities commence in the afternoon!
<P></P>
There is little sense of social status among the halflings in a village, aside
from the amused tolerance shown by adults to children and the general respect
for the elderly. Wealthy halflings are expected to throw bigger parties and to
generally show generosity to those less fortunate--yet they are not accorded
any 'upper class' standing because of this. The villagers may well elect a
sheriff, mayor, or constable and give this individual nominal authority to arrest
troublemakers. Rambunctious behavior is rare among halflings themselves, however,
so the sheriff's main concern will be to control the behavior of humans,
dwarves, and other possible troublemakers who come through the community.
