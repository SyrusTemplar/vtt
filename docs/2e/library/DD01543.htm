<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ancient History:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The character has learned the legends, lore, and history of some ancient time
and place. The knowledge must be specific, just as a historian would specialize
today in the English Middle Ages, the Italian Renaissance, or the Roman
Republic before Caesar. (The DM either can have ancient periods in mind for his game
or can allow the players to name and designate them.) Thus, a player character
could know details about the Age of Thorac Dragonking or the Time of the
Sea-Raiders or whatever else was available.

The knowledge acquired gives the character familiarity with the principal
legends, historical events, characters, locations, battles, breakthroughs
(scientific, cultural, and magical), unsolved mysteries, crafts, and oddities of the
time. The character must roll a proficiency check to identify places or things he
encounters from that age. For example, Rath knows quite a bit about the Coming
of the Trolls, a particularly dark period of dwarven history. Moving through
some deep caverns, he and his companions stumble across an ancient portal, sealed
for untold ages. Studying the handiwork, he realizes (rolls a successful
proficiency check) that it bears several seals similar to those he has seen on
?banned? portals from the time of Angnar, doorways to the legendary realm of Trolhel.
