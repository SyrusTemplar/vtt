<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Amulet of Perpetual Youth:</B> This amulet glows continuously with a faint, blue light. The wearer has
temporary immunity to the effects of both natural and magical aging; the amulet
grows older instead of the wearer. As the amulet ages, it gradually becomes dimmer.
The amulet can absorb 5-30 (5d6) years of aging, at which time its light dims
completely, its magic is negated, and the wearer resumes aging at his normal
rate.
