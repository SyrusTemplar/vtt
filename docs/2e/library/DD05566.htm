This god is the forger of weapons and armor, and also the craftsman of gold
and silver treasures. He is worshipped by metal-craftsmen across the world, and
sometimes visits inspirations for beautiful metal goods upon lucky craftsmen.
<P></P>
The priests of the god try to advance the art of metalwork at the mortal
level. They do this by acquiring as much information as they can about smithcrafting
and other metalwork, collecting it in libraries, and distributing it to
students and metalworking apprentices.
<P></P>
Lesser gods of this attribute will be gods of specific types of metalworking.
One might be the god of armoring, another the god of swordmaking.
<P></P>
The god of metalworking is male.

The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Arts, Crafts,
Divinity of Mankind, Fire, Literature/Poetry, Music/Dance, Race (Dwarf),
Strength, and War.
