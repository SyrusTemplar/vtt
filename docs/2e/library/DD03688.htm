This spell resembles the 5th-level wizard spell <I>etherealness </I>in many respects, but there are a few important differences. First, the priest
may not leave the Border Ethereal and venture into the Deep Ethereal;
therefore, at the end of the spell's duration, he must return to the Prime Material
Plane whether he wants to or not. Secondly, the priest may not use this spell on
an unwilling target and can only make another creature ethereal if the subject
is willing and in physical contact with the priest when the spell is cast.
Besides himself, the caster can bring one creature per two experience levels (three
at 5th, four at 7th, five at 9th, and so on) to the Ethereal Plane. Even if the
priest abandons his charges in the Border Ethereal, the stranded characters
will automatically materialize when the spell ends.
<P></P>
While <I>ethereal</I>, the priest cannot be detected by any means short of a <I>true seeing </I>or <I>detect phase </I>spell. He perceives his surroundings as misty, gray, and otherworldly. No
action he takes can affect the physical world, but he can pass through walls,
doors, and other solid objects without hindrance. The priest can choose to end the
spell voluntarily at any time, materializing in the physical world in one round.
If the caster occupies a solid object when the spell ends, he is hurled into
the Deep Ethereal and stranded in a catatonic stupor until he can be rescued.
