</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Poison complicates this situation, somewhat. A character who dies as a result
of poisoning may still have active venom in his system.
<P></P>
Poisons remain effective for 2d6 hours after the death of the victim. If the
character is raised during this time, some method must be found to neutralize
the poison before the character is restored to life. If this is not done, then
after the character rolls the resurrection survival check as given in “<A HREF="DD01751.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01751.htm">Raising the Dead</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">” later in this chapter (and assuming the roll is successful), he must
immediately roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or suffer all the effects of the
poison in his body, as per the normal rules. This may only injure some
characters, but it may kill other characters seconds after being raised!
