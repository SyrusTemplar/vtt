A character who is kneeling or sitting (for example, because he's been knocked
down or injured) is at a disadvantage in combat. He can't move around as
effectively and so cannot dodge incoming attacks. For that reason, whenever someone
attacks a victim who is kneeling, the attacker gets a +1 to attack rolls; when
someone attacks a victim who is sitting, the attacker gets a +2 to attack
rolls; and when someone attacks a victim who is flat on his back (but aware of the
attack and trying to avoid it), the attacker gets a +4 to attack rolls.
<P></P>
Attacking a character who is <I>held</I> (by magic) or asleep is automatically successful, causing normal damage.

When a character is kneeling, sitting, or on his back, he can get to his feet
one of two ways. If he still has an attack left to perform this round, he can
give it up, not make an attack, and stand up instead. Or, he can wait until
after initiative is rolled for the next round: When it comes time for him to
describe his action, he can stand up then, without losing any of his attacks for that
round.
