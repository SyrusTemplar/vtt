<P></P>
   All paladin kits include the following:
<P></P>
   <B>Description:</B> This section describes the duties, cultural background, manner, and
appearance of characters associated with this kit.
<P></P>
   <B>Requirements:</B> Ability score minimums and other special requirements are listed here.
Characters can't take the kit if they don't meet these qualifications. &quot;Standard&quot;
means there are no special requirements.
<P></P>
   <B>Ministration:</B> This identifies the paladin's immediate superiors. There are five
possibilities:
<P></P>
   <I>Church</I>. The paladin answers to the elders or dignitaries of an organized faith.
Usually, the paladin's immediate superior is a high-ranking priest.
<P></P>
   <I>Government</I>. The paladin works for a king, monarchy, or other government body or
official. Usually, the paladin's immediate superior is a military officer, often
another paladin of higher level.
<P></P>
   <I>Mentor</I>. The paladin takes orders from a family member, teacher, elder, or any other
individual not formally associated with a government or church.
<P></P>
   <I>Independent</I>. The paladin makes his own decisions. He answers to his deity or to his own
conscience. He may choose to follow the tenets of a church or promote the causes
of a government, but since he doesn't work for them he isn't required to obey
their edicts.
<P></P>
   <I>Any</I>. There are no ministration recommendations for this kit. The paladin may take
orders from whatever authority, if any, is appropriate to his culture and
background.
<P></P>
<B>   Role:</B> The character's function in society and in a campaign is detailed here. His
motivations, personality, and beliefs are examined, along with his relationships
with other people, his reasons for joining an adventuring party, and his
function within a party. Note that the personality traits don't necessarily apply to
every character associated with this kit. Players may shape the personalities
of their characters based on these suggestions, or they may disregard them
entirely and create their own personalities.
<P></P>
<B>   Symbol:</B> This section suggests one or more symbols to represent members of this kit.
Some governments or religions may require a character to display his symbol in a
particular fashion, such as embroidering it on his clothing or inscribing it
on his shield. Otherwise, a paladin may display his symbol as he wishes, or he
may choose not to do so. Players are also free to use symbols other than those
suggested.
<P></P>
   <B>Secondary Skills:</B> If you use the rules for secondary skills from Chapter 5 of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>, the character is restricted to the choice of skills listed in this section.
<P></P>
<B>   Weapon Proficiencies:</B> If you use the weapon proficiency rules, a kit may specify the character's
options. <I>Any</I> means he can take any weapon proficiency he likes (most paladins, regardless
of kit, will choose proficiencies in the lance and some type of sword). In
other cases, he may choose from a <I>recommended</I> list. <I>Required</I> means that the character <I>must</I> take the indicated weapon.
<P></P>
   <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Although nonweapon proficiency rules are technically optional, they're
strongly recommended when using the paladin kits. If you're using secondary skills,
don't use nonweapon proficiencies, and vice versa.
<P></P>
   Some nonweapon proficiencies are listed as <I>bonuses</I>. A character gets these proficiencies free of charge; they cost no
proficiency slots.
<P></P>
   The paladin must take any <I>required</I> proficiencies as soon as he can, spending the necessary slots. He may also
choose from among a list of <I>recommended</I> proficiencies. If he takes a recommended proficiency, he spends the normal
number of slots. It's a good idea for a beginning character to spend all or most
of his initial slots on recommended proficiencies, though he's not required to
do so.
<P></P>
   The character is barred from taking any proficiencies listed as<I> forbidden</I>.
<P></P>
   An asterisk (*) indicates a new proficiency described in Chapter 5.
<P></P>
   <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Equipment requirements and recommendations are given here. Unless indicated
otherwise, a character must buy the required equipment, including weapons, from
his initial funds. <I>Standard</I> means that the character has no specific requirements; see Chapter 7 for
suggestions.
<P></P>
   Like all members of the warrior group, a paladin begins with 50-200 (5d4x10)
gp. He may buy his equipment from these funds after he donates 10% to his
religious institution. If he lacks the funds to buy all of his required equipment, he
should buy as much as he can, then pick up the rest as soon as he gets the
money. All subsequent income is subject to tithing before the remainder can be
spent.
<P></P>
   <B>Bonded Mount:</B> The suggested species of bonded mount is given here.
<P></P>
<B>   Special Benefits:</B> Many kits grant special benefits. Typical benefits include improved
abilities, rights in particular situations, and reaction bonuses. All benefits are
received free of charge, and don't count against the normal limitations of the
paladin class.
<P></P>
   <B>Special Hindrances:</B> To balance their special benefits, kits also carry special hindrances.
Hindrances include reaction penalties, cultural restrictions, or ability limitations.
All special hindrances are in addition to disadvantages normally associated
with the paladin class.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Reaction Adjustment Reminder</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
   Many of the special benefits and hindrances are given as reaction adjustments.
A reaction bonus is expressed as a plus, such as +1. A reaction penalty is
expressed as a minus, like –2. When rolling for encounter reactions (on Table 59
in the <I>DMG</I>), make sure to <I>subtract</I> the bonuses and <I>add</I> the penalties. For example, if a character has a +1 reaction bonus, <I>subtract</I> 1 from the 2d10 roll—don't add it.
