<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Necklace of Prayer Beads</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B>:</B> A magical necklace of this sort appears to be a normal piece of nonvaluable
jewelry until it is placed about a character's neck. Even then, the true nature
of the item will be revealed only if the wearer is a priest (excluding druids
and characters otherwise able to use spells of a priestly or druidical nature
such as paladins and rangers). The <I>necklace of prayer beads</I> consists of 1d6+24 semi-precious (60%) and fancy (40%) stones. The wearer
will be 25% more likely to successfully petition his deity to grant desired
spells. There will also be 1d4+2 special beads (precious stones, gems of 1,000 gp
base value) of the following sort (roll 1d20 for each bead):

Each special bead can be used once per day. If the priest summons his deity
frivolously, the deity will, at the very least, take the necklace as punishment.
The function of each bead is known only when the bead is grasped and a <I>commune</I> spell used. All powers of the special beads are lost if they are removed from
the necklace.
