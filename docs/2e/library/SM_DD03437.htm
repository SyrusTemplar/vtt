Optional Abilities for Bards
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Bard characters may modify their spell abilities by selecting optional
abilities or restrictions from the following list. Note that these concentrate on the
bard-s spell powers; the other basic class abilities remain unchanged. For each
optional ability selected, the bard character must take a restriction of equal
value, so that the total number of character points spent remains 0. Or, these
abilities may be added to the bard list in <I>Player's Option: <A HREF="SP_DD02946.htm"></A></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="SP_DD02946.htm">Skills &amp; Powers</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Accelerated spell progression (15): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The bard enters <A HREF="PHB_DD01509.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01509.htm">Table 32</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Bard Spell Progression in the PHB as if he were one level higher. A
1st-level bard with this advantage has the spell power of a 2nd-level bard, a
4th-level bard is treated as a 5th-level bard, and so on.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Armor and spell use (5/10): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Normally, a bard cannot wear armor and cast spells. For 5 CPs, he may wear
leather or lighter armor and still use spells; for 10 CPs, he may wear any kind of
armor normally usable by a bard and still cast spells.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>School specialization (10): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A bard with this power may select a school of magic in which to specialize. He
may choose enchantment/charm, illusion, or song magic as his specialty. Bard
specialists gain all the normal benefits and restrictions associated with school
specialization, including opposition schools and penalties to learning spells
outside their chosen school. However, they may not engage in spell research.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Scroll use (10): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This is the optional ability described above under <A HREF="DD03436.htm#1dd3cd1c"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03436.htm#1dd3cd1c">Bards and Scroll Use</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> . Instead of waiting until 10th level, the bard may attempt to use wizard
spell scrolls at 4th level. His success chance is 25%, plus 10% per experience
level above 4th (maximum 85%). If the reading fails, the scroll-s effects usually
rebound on the bard or his companions with deleterious results.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wizard magical item use (10): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A bard with this ability may make use of magical items normally reserved for
use by wizards, including wands, rings, and miscellaneous magical items, but not
rods or staves.
