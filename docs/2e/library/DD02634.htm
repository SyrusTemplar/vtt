<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">By spending an extra proficiency slot on a weapon, a single-class fighter
character can become a <I>specialist</I>. A fighter may only specialize in one weapon at a time. If she wishes to
change her specialization to a different weapon, she must spend two extra
proficiency slots to become a specialist in the new weapon, and loses all benefits of
specializing in the previous one (although she is still proficient with it and
always will be). Any more changes cost three slots each, so itâ€™s a good idea to
pick one weapon and stick with it.
<P></P>
The exact benefits of weapon specialization vary with the particular weapon
involved. Generally, the types of benefits fall into one of five categories:
melee weapons, missile weapons, bows, crossbows, and firearms.
