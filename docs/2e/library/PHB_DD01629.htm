</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Holy Item:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Holy items are small representations of all those things revered by
religions--stars, crosses, hammers, rosaries, anointed oils, blessed wine, sacred
teachings, and more. Just what constitutes a holy item depends on the campaign your
character is in. All good holy items have similar effects on undead and other
evil creatures, provided they are wielded by a follower of a belief associated
with these items. Thus, rules that refer to holy symbols and holy water apply to
all similar items, provided these items are specially prepared by the cleric's
order.
<P></P>
Because of their special nature, holy items cannot normally be purchased.
Different sects tend to protect the symbols of their faith to prevent their misuse
or corruption. Therefore such items must be obtained through the auspices of a
local congregation. This is not difficult for sincere followers of that faith,
although requests for rare or unusual items must always be justified.
Nonbelievers are given holy items only if there is a clear and present danger to the
faith.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Lanterns:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A <I>hooded lantern</I> (30-foot radius of light) is a standard lantern with shuttered or hinged
sides. It is not directional, as its light is cast equally in all directions. A <I>bullseye lantern</I> (60-foot radius of light) has only a single shutter, the other sides being
highly polished to reflect the light in a single direction. Both hooded and
bullseye lanterns can be carried in one hand. A single flask of oil (one pint) burns
for six hours in either.
<P></P>
The <I>beacon lantern</I> (240-foot radius of light) is a much larger affair and must be mounted on the
prow of a ship, the bed of a wagon, or other large structure. It operates like
the bullseye lantern but illuminates to a greater distance. The beacon goes
through oil quickly, burning a flask every two hours.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Locks:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Locks are still fairly primitive affairs (except for those complicated by the
use of magic). All are worked with a large bulky key. Combination locks are
virtually unknown at this time. As with most things, there are good, very complex
locks as well as bad, easily opened locks.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Magnifying Glass:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This simple lens is more an oddity than a useful tool. It does not greatly
enhance viewing, especially since many are unevenly ground, creating distortion.
It is useful as a substitute for tinder and steel when starting fires.
<P></P>
<B> </B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Merchant's Scale:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This is a small balance and pans along with a suitable assortment of weights.
Its main use is to weigh coins--a common method of settling a transaction.
Merchants are well aware that coins can be undersized, shaved, or plated. The only
sound protection is to check the coins against a set of established weights. It
is also needed when using foreign coins to make a purchase or exchange. Of
course, merchants are no more noble than anyone else and may use sets of false
weights--one set heavier than normal for selling an item (causing the customer to
pay more) and another set lighter than usual for buying items (letting the
merchant pay less). In well-regulated areas, officials verify the accuracy of
weights and measures, but this in itself is no protection. Players may wish to have
a scale and weights for their own protection.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Oil:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I>Greek fire</I> is a general name given to all highly flammable oils used in combat.
(Historically, Greek fire was a special combination of oil and chemicals that was
sticky and difficult to extinguish.) These oils are highly flammable and a little
dangerous to carry. <I>Lamp oil</I> is used for lamps and lanterns. It is not particularly explosive although it
can be used to feed an existing blaze.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Spyglass:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Like the magnifying glass, the spyglass is more of an oddity than a useful
item. Objects viewed through it are a little closer, although not much. For better
results magical items are preferred. The spyglass gives from two to three
times magnification.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Thieves' Picks:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This is a small collection of tools useful to burglars. The kit includes one
or more skeleton keys, long metal picks, a long-nosed clamp, a small hand saw,
and a small wedge and hammer. These combined with some common tools (such as a
crowbar) make up most of the special equipment a thief needs to perform his
trade.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Water Clock:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This bulky item is good for giving the time accurate to a half-hour. Activated
by a regulated flow of drops, the water clock is not something you carry in
your pocket. For it to work at all, it must have a source of water and be left
undisturbed. A very uncommon item, it is primarily an amusement for the wealthy
and a tool for the student of arcane lore. The vast majority of society is not
concerned with exact time.
