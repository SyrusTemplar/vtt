By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical field of force that
serves as if it were scale mail armor (AC 6). The spell has no effect on a person
already armored or a creature with Armor Class 6 or better. It is not cumulative
with the <I>shield</I> spell, but it is cumulative with Dexterity and, in case of fighter/mages,
with the shield bonus. The <I>armor</I> spell does not hinder movement or prevent spellcasting, and adds no weight or
encumbrance. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the wearer
sustains cumulative damage totaling greater than 8 points + 1 per level of the caster.
(It is important to note that the armor does <I>not</I> absorb this damage. The armor merely grants an AC of 6; the wearer still
suffers full damage from any successful attacks.) Thus, the wearer might suffer 8
points from an attack, then several minutes later sustain an additional 1 point
of damage. Unless the spell were cast by a wizard of 2nd level or higher, it
would be dispelled at this time. Until it is dispelled, the <I>armor</I> spell grants the wearer full benefits of the Armor Class gained.

The material component is a piece of finely cured leather that has been
blessed by a priest.
