<P></P>
A creature's beliefs and expectations can influence the way it fights,
especially if it has at least average intelligence.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Chaotic
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The creature tends to think of itself. It does not respond well to leadership
unless intimidated or persuaded to follow orders. Its tactics are usually
intended to improve its individual effectiveness and survival, not the group-s.
<P></P>
Chaotic creatures are apt to seek quick and dramatic results and combat, and
are likely to employ called shots, offensive disarms, and shield rushes.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Neutral</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The creature is as likely to consider the needs of the group as much as
itself, so long as it can serve one without compromising the other. The creature
responds moderately well to leadership, so long as it does not feel its needs are
being subordinated to the group-s. The creature has no great desire for
individual glory.
<P></P>
Neutral creatures are apt to seek ways to restrict an opponent's options and
to counter opposing actions, and are likely to employ parries, blocks,
pull/trips, and defensive disarms.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Lawful
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The creature tends to think of its group. The creature responds well to
leadership, providing it is not inept, ineffective, or unnecessarily harsh. The
creature generally functions as a cog in a larger machine, promoting a common goal
it shares with its companions.
<P></P>
Lawful creatures are apt to choose tactics that rely on the group, such as
shield walls, pike hedges, and massed overbearing attacks.

<P></P>
A creature's morale score measures its ferocity, perseverance, and courage.
Though most frequently used to decide if a creature runs away or surrenders
during a fight, morale also can serve as guideline for deciding the creature-s
general willingness to fight.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Unreliable-Unsteady (2?7)</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The creature is most likely to deal with a threat by running away or hiding
unless it has been trained for war or it has been cornered. If forced to fight,
the creature does not purposefully do anything that exposes it to increased
danger.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Average-Steady (8?12)
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The creature is not so skittish as to flee at the first sign of a threat. If
it does not wish to fight, it is likely to bluff or stand its ground before
taking flight. The creature is not aggressive and is unlikely to make an unprovoked
attack unless it is hungry or otherwise stands to gain from a fight. It is
unlikely to make a frontal attack when outnumbered or outsized; if sufficiently
motivated, the creature might wait for an opportunity to attack when it has an
advantage over an otherwise superior group. Once a fight begins, the creature is
willing to try almost anything that will improve its chances for victory,
provided the risk does not exceed the potential reward.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Elite-Champion (13?16)</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The creature is aggressive and generally tries to bluff its way out of fights
it does not want. If the bluff fails, the creature is more likely to fight than
run away. If faced with a superior force, it almost always looks for ways to
even the odds before attacking. After a fight begins, the creature is willing
the undertake considerable risks to help insure a victory.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fanatic-Fearless (17+)
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The creature is very aggressive. It does not bluff, preferring to attack when
threatened. Once engaged in a fight, it seldom retreats. It is willing to take
almost any risk to gain a victory.
