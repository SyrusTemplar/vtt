Holy water, that bane of vampires and many other monsters, is created in the
following way:
<P></P>
In a temple of the god, three priests of second level or higher stand over an
empty water-basin and perform a ritual of prayer. They pray for the god's
blessing and protection for an entire hour. At the end of that time, they each cast
a spell, and do so simultaneously: One casts<I> create water</I> , the second casts <I>protection from evil</I>, and the third casts <I>purify food &amp; drink</I>. Half a gallon of holy water is created.
<P></P>
(The <I>create water</I> spell can create up to four gallons of water, but the <I>protection from evil</I> and <I>purify food &amp; drink</I> used this way can only create half a gallon of holy water. Therefore, for
every two extra priests, one to cast each of those two spells, an extra
half-gallon can be created. Nine priests together can create four gallons.)
<P></P>
The tremendous expenditure of magic and the time involved are the reasons why
a single dose of holy water costs 25 gp to the adventurer. Obviously, any three
priests can create holy water &quot;for free&quot; so long as they are second level or
higher and are priests of the same god.
<P></P>
Holy symbols are enchanted in the same way. Each enchantment takes an hour,
requires three priests (substituting<I> sanctuary</I> for <I>create water</I>), and requires a material component: Some object carved with the god's symbol.
