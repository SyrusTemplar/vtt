The thunder-god is very similar to the lightning-god; in campaigns where they
both exist, they will probably be related, even brothers. He represents the
fearsomeness of nature, natural forces at their most frightening, and so is a god
of terror and fear as well. Like the lightning-god, he is also a god of storms.
<P></P>
Also as with the lightning-god, the thunder-god is not very concerned with the
affairs of mortals; he lets them worship him and grants power to his priests,
but otherwise doesn't interfere much in mortal affairs. His priests promote
worship of his power and fearsomeness, especially as traits which the followers
wish to use against their enemies.
<P></P>
The thunder-god is male.

Forces, Lightning (especially), Nature, Race (Dwarven), Sky/Weather, and Strength.
