<P></P>
Range: Touch
<P></P>
Components: V, S
<P></P>
Duration: Special; max. 10 rounds
<P></P>
Casting Time: 3
<P></P>
Area of Effect: One body of liquid
<P></P>
Saving Throw: Neg.
<P></P>
<P></P>
This spell may be cast on any body of liquid as large as an ocean or as small
as a glass of wine. The first creature whose reflection is cast on the surface
of the liquid releases the spell. When the spell is triggered, the liquid
immediately forms an exact three-dimensional image of the reflected creature. If
more than one creature casts a reflection simultaneously, only one watery double
forms. Each creature has an equal chance of being the victim of the spell (roll
randomly).
<P></P>
The size of the <I>watery double</I> is restricted by the volume of fluid available. If the spell were cast on a
full mug of ale, the double would form from the ale, becoming a mug-sized
duplicate of the victim. The<I> watery double</I> will never exceed the actual size of the victim regardless of the size of the
body of liquid.
<P></P>
When the spell is cast on the liquid, its duration is considered permanent
until the power is released by a creature's reflection. The liquid will not
evaporate until the spell is triggered. When the<I> watery double</I> forms, it remains animated for 1 round per experience level of the caster, to
a maximum of 10 rounds.
<P></P>
The <I>watery double</I> attempts to touch the creature it has duplicated. It can affect only the
creature that it resembles. It has the same THAC0 and current hit points as the
creature it duplicates, but cannot cast spells or use any of the creature's
magical items or special abilities. The <I>watery double</I> is AC 6 and its movement rate is double that of the victim. It may seep under
doors and through cracks.
<P></P>
If the <I>watery double</I> succeeds in touching the creature, it merges with the individual, covering
his entire body in a skin of liquid. The victim must attempt a saving throw. If
successful, the creature has resisted the spell's effect and the <I>watery double</I> &quot;dies,&quot; becoming normal fluid (and soaking the creature in the process). If
the saving throw is failed, the<I> watery double</I> begins forcing its way into the victim's body, inflicting 1d8 points of
damage per round until it is destroyed.
<P></P>
The <I>watery double</I> dissipates if reduced to zero hit points or when the spell's duration
expires. Striking the watery double while it is wrapped around its victim causes an
equal amount of damage to the victim. <I>Part water, lower water</I>, and <I>transmute water to dust</I> spells instantly destroy a <I>watery double</I>.
