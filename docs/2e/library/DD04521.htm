<TITLE>Trimia's Catalogue of Outer Plane Artifacts-- Miscellaneous Magic (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>
<script src="jscripts.js"></script><link rel="stylesheet" href="toc.css"></HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Trimia's Catalogue of Outer Plane Artifacts:</B> This magical device is a large book bound in heavy wooden covers that do not
reveal the title or nature of the work. Upon opening to the first page, the
owner finds the title of the book along with a table of contents listing the
various outer planes.
<P></P>
Upon opening the book to the desired page, the owner finds either a blank page
(25% chance) or a description of a magical device (75% chance) that provides
transportation to that particular plane. Along with the description of the
device is a price ranging from 1,000 to 20,000 gp (1d20x 1,000). If the appropriate
sum is laid on the open book and a <I>vanish</I> spell is subsequently cast on the coins, the transport device shown appears
in place of the cash. The page then immediately goes blank and the catalogue
disappears, teleported to a random location on the Prime Material plane.
<P></P>
The transport device can deliver characters to the outer planes and can return
them to their point of departure on the Prime Material plane. Each transport
device brings a person or persons to the upper layer of an outer plane. The
point of arrival in the plane is left to the DM and usually changes each time the
device is used.
<P></P>
Each device has a command word which is always the name of the plane
associated with the device. Unless otherwise noted, anyone touching the device or
touching the person who holds the device is transported to the upper plane of the
outer plane named.
<P></P>
Each transport device can be used once per day. With each use, there is a 5%
chance the device will malfunction, sending the characters to the desired plane,
but with the device itself disappearing.
<P></P>
<I>Nirvana:</I> The device used to transport to the plane of Nirvana is a small pocket watch,
a device of unspeakable rarity. The watch keeps perfect time according to the
yearly cycle of the sun and never needs winding. The watch is solid gold and
has two long, thin gold chains that run through a metal loop at the top of the
watch.
<P></P>
<I>Arcadia:</I> Arcadia's transportation device is a palm-sized metal sculpture representing
the outlines of geometrical shapes. The largest shape is a six-sided cubic cage
made of 12 silver rods. Within this cube is a four-sided pyramid, also made of
silver rods. Inside the pyramid is a circle of silver.
<P></P>
<I>Seven Heavens</I>: A featureless sphere of gold is used to travel to the Seven Heavens. The
sphere is three inches in diameter and would appear to be nothing more than a
valuable bauble if not for the golden glow it always radiates. The glow has the
properties of a <I>continual light</I> spell.
<P></P>
<I>Twin Paradises</I>: This device appears to be a featureless cube of silver measuring three
inches on a side. If it is carefully examined, four small, nearly invisible buttons
will be visible. If the four buttons are pressed in the correct order, the cube
splits in half. (The correct order can be determined through the use of <I>legend lore</I> and similar spells.) The device will teleport to the Twin Paradises when half
the cube is held in each hand and the command word is spoken. The travelers
arrive in Dothion, considered the topmost plane. The two halves of the cube must
be reassembled before it can once again be used to teleport.
<P></P>
<I>Elysium:</I> The device used to reach this plane is a sturdy currach, a primitive vessel
made from thick hide stretched over a wood-and-wicker frame. This device
functions as a normal ship, with a seaworthiness rating of 95%. If anyone touches the
ship's mast and speaks the word Elysium, the boat, its passengers and crew, and
all cargo are transported to the Oceanus River in the plane of Amoria.
<P></P>
<I>Happy Hunting Grounds:</I> A leaf sculpted of gold is the device used to arrive in the Happy Hunting
Grounds. The leaf is about two inches long and is wrought in fine detail.
<P></P>
<I>Olympus:</I> The device used to reach the plane of Olympus is a silver chariot. The
chariot can comfortably hold four passengers and their gear or eight passengers
without equipment. A team of four horses must be attached to the chariot; when the
chariot is in motion and the command word is spoken, the horses, chariot,
passengers, and gear are transported to Olympus. The chariot arrives in the plane in
motion.
<P></P>
<I>Gladsheim:</I> The device used to reach Gladsheim is a prism approximately three inches in
length. To operate the device, the prism must be used outdoors to create a
rainbow on the ground. When the command word is spoken, the rainbow grows out of the
ground and rises up into the sky. The rainbow lasts for 1 turn. Anyone who
steps onto the rainbow is whisked up the colored path and into the plane of
Asgard.
<P></P>
<I>Limbo:</I> Limbo is reached through the use of a magical mirror. When a person stands
before the mirror, he sees his own image reflected normally. The reflected world
behind him, however, is in utter chaos--the bricks from the wall behind him
float in the air, flames drift across the room, gold and silver pieces break apart
and wander aimlessly. If the command word is spoken as a character looks into
the mirror, he is transported to any of the planes of Limbo. The mirror does
not travel to Limbo. Another means of returning to the Prime Material plane must
be found.
<P></P>
<I> Pandemonium:</I> This device is a jar perpetually filled with black pitch. When the pitch is
spread on a stone wall and the command word spoken, a portal forms in the wall,
leading to a cavern in Pandesmos. The pitch evaporates after 5 rounds and
magically reappears in the jar.
<P></P>
<I>Abyss:</I> Pazunia, the uppermost layer of the innumerable layers of the Abyss, can be
reached through the use of a circular black cloth that looks like a <I>portable hole</I>. The cloth is three feet in diameter and can be folded to fit inside a
pocket. When the cloth is spread on the ground and the command word is spoken, the
cloth becomes a pit that leads to the plane. The cloth exists as a pit for 1
turn, then returns to its state as a piece of cloth. It does not follow travelers
to the Abyss.
<P></P>
<I>Tarterus<B>:</B></I> This device is a necklace of dull, reddish pearls. A character who wears the
necklace and speaks the command word will be transported (along with anyone
touching him) to Othrys, the topmost layer of the plane.
<P></P>
<I>Hades:</I> The device used to reach Hades is an iron keelboat. When any character on the
boat speaks the command word, the keelboat and all it passengers are
transported to the river Styx in Oinos, the uppermost layer of Hades.
<P></P>
<I>Gehenna:</I> Characters who wish to travel to Gehenna must gather in a small, enclosed
room with this magical urn of silver and bronze. A flame must be lit within the
urn using materials that cause a great deal of smoke. When the room is so choked
with smoke that breathing is almost impossible, the command word may be spoken.
This transports everyone and everything in the room, including the urn, to
Khala, the uppermost layer of Gehenna.
<P></P>
<I>Nine Hells:</I> The Nine Hells can be reached by using special pieces of blood-red coal. When
one of these coals is lit or dropped into a flame, a ball of fire flares out
from the coal. It does no damage, but transports all creatures and objects
within 20 feet to Avernus. No command word is needed for the effect to take place.
<P></P>
<I>Acheron:</I> The device used to reach Acheron is a two-inch cube of black onyx. The cube
always appears as a puzzle inside a black sack. The puzzle is made up of 43
small pieces, which must be fit together to form the cube. When complete, the
command word must be spoken.
<P></P>
Solving the puzzle require an Intelligence check at half a creature's
Intelligence score. Each attempt to solve the puzzle requires 1d6 turns. Once the cube
has been used to teleport, it falls to pieces. The pieces all reappear in the
sack, wherever it might be. To use the device again, the pieces must be
reassembled.
