Some cultures are <I>theocracies</I> , which means they are ruled by their priestly classes. Naturally, in such a
culture, one priesthood will be dominant; the culture may worship only one god,
or may tolerate other worships but be mainly devoted to one specific god.
<P></P>
In a theocracy, the nation may be ruled by a board of priests from the state
religion, but it's more common for it to be ruled by a single king who is also a
priest and the head of his priesthood. Such an arrangement may be benevolent,
with a wise cleric ruling the land; or it may be particularly nasty, with a
power-mad priest or the priest of an evil god in charge.
<P></P>
Many &quot;lost worlds&quot; (i.e., nations hidden away from the rest of the world,
secluded in a lost valley or cavern or other distant place) are theocracies ruled
by evil priests; adventurer-heroes stumbling into such cultures often find
themselves having to stir up revolution and cast down these rulers so that justice
can return to these lands.
