<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Bowyer/Fletcher:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> This character can make bows and arrows (but not arrowheads) of the types
available in the campaign world. Given appropriate materials, the character can
successfully make a bow or 2–12 arrows in a day. (Note that finding the right
branch for the bow, or the proper shafts and feathers for the arrows might take
several days of searching!)
<P></P>
Weaponsmiths are required to make good steel arrowheads. If none are
available, the character can fire harden the wooden tips of his arrows, but these
weapons suffer a –1 penalty on all damage rolls, and any arrow that misses its target
is 50% likely to be broken.
