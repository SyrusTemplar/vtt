<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Use of Proficiencies by Nonproficient Characters</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> In general, characters will not be able to perform a task unless they have
some level of proficiency in it. However, the DM can allow nonproficient
adventurers to attempt proficiency tasks, under a few circumstances. In general, the
tasks performed must be very simple, and the character will not be able to
perform them very well. Tasks that nonproficient characters attempt would generally
fall into the automatic success category if they were attempted by a proficient
character. A nonproficient character must roll a successful check using the
proficiency's initial success rating, modified by the character's relevant
ability. If a trait is relevant to the use of the proficiency (see <A HREF="DD03018.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03018.htm">proficiency descriptions</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">), a nonproficient character with that trait can claim this modifier when
attempting a check.
<P></P>
Several considerations might allow these types of checks:
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Life or Death:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A non swimmer who falls in the water might be allowed to make a swimming
proficiency check. Success means the character is able to stay afloat, perhaps
moving slowly toward shore. Note that this would be an automatic success for any
character with the swimming proficiency. If modifiers exist that would require a
proficient character to check (the PC is encumbered, or the water is very
rough) then the nonproficient character will certainly fail.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>All the Time in the World: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A character who does not have the agriculture proficiency, but is willing to
spend two weeks planting a small plot of land, should be allowed to make a
proficiency check. Success means some kind of useful crop.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Excellent Instruction:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> If the blacksmith's arm is broken, but he can sit next to the forge and
describe to the novice every step of the procedure, the nonproficient character
should be allowed a proficiency check to create a simple object such as a horseshoe
or a nail. Anything that would require the blacksmith to make a proficiency
check, however, would be beyond the skills of the nonproficient character.
