   By tapping into the powerful forces generated by his faith, the paladin can
become a living conduit of lawful good energy. He may focus this energy to
terrify undead or blast them out of existence.
<P></P>
   A paladin gains the ability to turn undead at 3rd level. As shown on Table 10
in Chapter 1, a paladin turns undead at two levels lower than a cleric; that
is, a 3rd-level paladin turns undead as a 1st-level cleric. Otherwise, a paladin
has the same restrictions as a cleric:
<P></P>
• A turning attempt counts as an action and takes one combat round to execute.
The attempt occurs during the paladin's turn, determined by the order of
initiative.
<P></P>
• A paladin can make only one attempt to turn a particular group of undead. In
general, a group consists of all undead that the paladin can see, within a reasonable range (as determined by the DM). If a
paladin successfully turns five of a group of seven skeletons, he can't make a second attempt on the remaining two.
Another priest or paladin, however, may make try to turn them.
<P></P>
   Two or more paladins (or priests) can attempt to simultaneously turn the same
group of undead. If a particular undead suffers more than one penalty, apply
the most effective result. For instance, if a skeleton suffers a &quot;T'' result from
a paladin and a &quot;D&quot; result from a priest, apply the &quot;D'' result.
<P></P>
• The paladin's hands must be free, and he must be able to speak; he can't
turn undead by simply standing in place. The attempt should be accompanied by a
dramatic gesture (the paladin sweeps his arms before him, or extends both palms
towards the undead, then squeezes his hands into fists) or phrase (such as
&quot;Disperse and dispel!&quot; or &quot;Fall before the power of righteousness!&quot;). The exact
gesure or phrase is up to the paladin.
<P></P>
   What happens to an undead when it is turned? A &quot;D&quot; result destroys it,
instantly and permanently. The DM determines the physical effects—the flashier, the
better. A skeleton crumbles to dust. A crimson flame envelopes a ghoul, then
disappears. A spectre screams as it is sucked through an invisible portal the size
of a pinhole. A vampire melts into a steaming puddle.
<P></P>
   The effects of a &quot;T&quot; result depend whether the undead is bound by the orders
of another or has free will. A bound undead, such as a skeleton, retreats, hugs
the wall, or otherwise gets out of the way of the paladin and his companions.
If free-willed, the undead tries to flee. If unable to escape, it circles at a
distance, coming no closer to the paladin than 10 feet. Once turned, the undead
may hiss or claw the air, but it will take no direct action against the
paladin, even if the paladin turns away. Should he move within 10 feet of the undead,
the paladin violates the turning, and the undead attacks normally.
