<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Anada, the elf warrior from the previous example, lures one of his bugbear
guards into his cell in another bid to escape. The guard is wary of trouble, so
the DM rules there is no chance for surprise, but also gives Anada the first
attack as he lunges from behind the door and grapples with the bugbear.
<P></P>
The bugbear is armed, and turns toward Anada as he attacks. Because Anada is
threatened, the bugbear gets an attack of opportunity before Anada makes his
wrestling attack. Anada gets lucky and the bugbear misses. Anada makes an attack
roll vs. Armor Class 10 and rolls a 7, good enough to hit.
<P></P>
Now Anada checks to see if he achieves a hold. Anada and the bugbear make
opposed attack rolls. Anada is attacking Armor Class 10 because the bugbear has no
magical or Dexterity bonuses; Anada suffers a –4 penalty for being a size class
smaller than the bugbear but gains a +1 bonus from his Strength. The bugbear
is attacking Armor Class 8 because of Anada’s <I>chain mail +</I>1 and 15 Dexterity. Anada rolls a 10, good enough to hit. The bugbear rolls an
18, also good enough to hit; however, Anada wins the opposed attack roll
because he succeeded with a lower number. Anada has a hold on the bugbear and
inflicts 1d2+1 points of damage (because of a successful hold and Anada’s 17
Strength). Anada inflicts 2 points of damage, both temporary.
<P></P>
During its attack phase, the bugbear drops its weapon, which is too big to use
while grappled, and tries to break free. Anada and the bugbear conduct another
opposed attack roll, this time with the bugbear gaining a +4 bonus to its roll
for the size difference, since it is the attacker. The bugbear rolls a 20,
normally good enough to score a critical hit against Anada’s effective Armor Class
of 8. Anada, however, rolls an 11, good enough to hit the bugbear’s effective
Armor Class of 10 and win the opposed roll (because it is successful and lower
than the bugbear’s roll). Because the bugbear didn’t win the opposed roll, the
critical roll is disregarded; the bugbear does not achieve a lock on Anada.
<P></P>
Now that both combatants have taken an attack phase, the combat proceeds to
the next combat round. Anada wins initiative and tries to achieve a lock on the
bugbear. There is another opposed roll, and Anada wins with a roll of 12 versus
the bugbear’s 2 (the bugbear lost because its attack failed and Anada’s
succeeded). Anada achieves a lock and decides to hold the bugbear’s mouth shut to keep
it from calling for help. The DM decides this is a manipulation, and the
bugbear suffers another 1d2+1 points of damage. Anada inflicts 3 points of damage,
all temporary.
<P></P>
The bugbear tries to free itself once again during its attack phase, but loses
the opposed roll. The combat round ends.
<P></P>
During the next round, the bugbear wins initiative, but loses the opposed roll
again. Now that the bugbear’s mouth is clamped shut, Anada decides to twist
the bugbear’s head a little, which qualifies as a press. The DM decides Anada can
keep hold of the bugbear’s mouth while wrenching at its head, but Anada still
must make another opposed roll to establish the press. Anada wins again and
inflicts 1d6+2 points of damage (1d6+1 for the press, plus one for Anada’s
Strength). Anada rolls a 4 and inflicts 6 points of damage, 1 normal and 5 temporary.
The bugbear has now suffered 9 points of damage, 8 temporary and one normal.
The bugbear started with 14 hit points, is now at 5, and struggles on.
<P></P>
Anada loses initiative the next round and the bugbear tries to free itself
again. There is another opposed roll, which the bugbear loses. If the bugbear had
won, both the press (head twist) and manipulation (mouth clamp) would have been
broken and Anada would only have had a simple hold.
<P></P>
Anada decides to press again on his attack phase. There is another opposed
roll, which Anada wins; because Anada was just holding on, the bugbear could not
have achieved a lock by winning the roll with a critical hit. Anada has
maintained his press through two attack phases, so he inflicts an extra point of
damage, for a total of 1d6+3 points. Anada inflicts 7 more points of damage, 1 normal
and 6 temporary. The bugbear’s hit point total is now below zero, and it falls
unconscious for 2d6 full turns. Anada picks up the bugbear’s weapon and slips
out of the cell.
