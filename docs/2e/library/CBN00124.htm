This minor meditation focuses a baneful, necromantic aura in the caster-s
chosen hand, enveloping the fingers in a dark, flickering radiance. The aura of the <I>ebony hand</I> enhances the delivery of harmful, touch-related spells (such as <I>cause light wounds</I> or <I>cause disease</I>) by providing a +1 bonus on the priest's attack roll for every three levels
of experience past the first (+2 to hit at 4th level, +3 at 7th level, to a
maximum of +4 to hit at 10th level).
<P></P>
Once the <I>ebony hand</I> is cast, the magic of the touch-delivered spell is no longer conducted though
physical contact with the caster's fingertips, but through the flickering aura
of the ebony hand.
<P></P>
The companion touch-delivered spell(s) may be cast either before or after the
creation of the<I> ebony hand</I>, which does not expire with a single, successful touch and may be used to
deliver multiple attacks if the spell duration permits. Note that the <I>ebony hand</I> does not enhance attacks with weapons or other ranged spells.
<P></P>
The material component varies from religion to religion, but it is usually a
piece of apparel or jewelry which is worn on the caster's hand to help focus the
meditation (often a black glove or a simple silver or onyx ring). Regardless
of the actual focus employed, the material component is not consumed by the
spell and may be employed in multiple castings. As the spell description implies,
the ebony hand may only be granted by malevolent deities to their evil priests.
