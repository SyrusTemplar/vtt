</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The new wizard spells in this section include over two dozen examples of
white, gray, and black necromancy. The DM may use these new spells to augment the
standard selection available in the<I> Player’s Handbook (PHB)</I>. The DM can also find interesting necromancy spells in the <I>Tome of Magic (TOM), Complete Wizard’s Handbook (WH), Arabian Adventures (AA)</I>, and <I>Forgotten Realms Adventures</I> hardcover <I>(FOR)</I>. For the DM’s convenience, relevant spells from all these sources have been
included in the appendices and spell index at the end of the book. The DM may
also refer to <I>Van Richten’s Guide to the Lich</I>, though almost all of the spells from this source have been designed for use
by undead. Finally, the DM may care to adapt some of the new priest spells from
Chapter Six, though the wizard versions should be at least one or two levels
higher than their clerical counterparts.
<P></P>
Some of the spells presented here (and in other chapters) were first developed
by other game designers. These authors, who have helped advance the body of
necromantic lore, are acknowledged with special thanks on page 3.
<P></P>
The following spell descriptions conform in most respects to the standard
format in the <I>Player’s Handbook</I>, starting with specifications for range, components, duration, and so on.
