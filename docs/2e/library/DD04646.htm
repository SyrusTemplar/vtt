Crafts priests are those who are dedicated to the patron deities of one of the
dwarven crafts. Although they frequently will have a temple in a stronghold,
they usually preside over a shrine or chapel in the workshops where their craft
is practiced. They are usually members of that craft's clan.
<P></P>
<B>Barred:</B> Crafts priests usually worship the god of crafts, but they may belong to most
other religions. In such cases, they are the priests who prepare ceremonial
and sacrificial items. Priests of the following gods may not be crafts priests:
birth and children, death, evil, disease, fertility, justice, marriage, love,
mischief, trickery, and trade.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> Crafts priests are more concerned with their crafts than with the welfare of
fellow dwarves. They will seek out the finest raw materials and are often
engaged in expeditions to discover new mines or found new strongholds. Their
expertise in these matters is highly sought. Rarely tied to a central temple, they are
free to go where they please.

<B>Equipment: </B>Crafts priests must have access to the tools required for their craft. If
these are large, such as a forge, the priest is not required to own one, but the DM
should inform him where he can go to use one. Apart from that, Crafts priests
may use any kind of equipment.
