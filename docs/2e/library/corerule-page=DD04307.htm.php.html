This spell requires the priest to perform a numerological analysis of a
subject's correct name. The result is that the priest may cast another spell that
affects the subject individual at a range much greater than normal. In other
words, by gaining deep knowledge of the individual, the priest creates a &quot;channel&quot;
to that individual that makes a subsequent spell easier to cast on that subject.

For spells marked with an asterisk (*), <I>telethaumaturgy</I> also increases the range of the reversed spell. Unless indicated, <I>telethaumaturgy</I> does not increase the range of the reversed spells.
<P></P>
The increase in range depends on the level of the priest casting <I>telethaumaturgy</I>:

Thus, a 12th-level priest who has cast <I>telethaumaturgy</I> on an individual could subsequently cast charm person on that individual at a
range of 320 yards, rather than the normal range of 80 yards.
<P></P>
A spell to be enhanced by <I>telethaumaturgy</I> must be cast on the round immediately following the completion of <I>telethaumaturgy</I>. Spells that normally affect more than one individual (such as confusion )
will affect only the selected subject when cast following <I>telethaumaturgy</I>.
<P></P>
When <I>telethaumaturgy</I> is cast by a priest of 11th level or higher, it has an additional effect. If
the target is within the normal range of the subsequent spell (e.g., 80 yards
for <I>charm person</I>), the subject's saving throw suffers a penalty of -2.
<P></P>
Like the <I>personal reading</I> spell,<I> telethaumaturgy</I> functions only if the priest knows the correct name of his subject. If the
priest casts the spell using an alias, he will not know that <I>telethaumaturgy</I> has not taken effect until the subsequent spell fails. The priest does not
automatically know why the subsequent spell failed (the subject might simply have
made a successful saving throw).
<P></P>
The material component is a small book of numerological formulae and notes.
This book is different from the book used in <I>personal reading</I>. The book is not consumed in the casting.
