<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Direct Fire Engines
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Ballistae and cannons fire their projectiles in a low, flat curve. They are
fairly accurate, though somewhat difficult to aim at small targets. Only light
ballistae can be aimed as freely as a hand-held weapon can; larger engines can
hit small targets only by aiming at the area containing the target.
<P></P>
All targets are considered Armor Class 10. If the target is a creature (not an
area containing a creature) bonuses from Dexterity and magical protections
apply. The attack roll is modified as follows:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> +3 for stationary targets;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> –3 for targets moving at a rate greater than 3 but less than 12;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> –6 for targets moving at a rate of 12 or greater;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> +4 for the second and subsequent shots at a stationary target;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> +2 for targets whose largest dimension is greater than 30';
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> +4 for targets whose largest dimension is greater than 90';
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> +6 for targets whose largest dimension is greater than 270';
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> –2 for targets at medium range;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> –5 for targets at long range.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Modifiers for cover and concealment also apply. Concealment versus direct fire
bombardment engines is easier to find than true cover, as few barriers are
substantial enough to resist hits. For example, a thick hedgerow might provide
cover from arrows and sling stones, but it can provide only concealment against
cannon fire.
<P></P>
The procedures for determining the effects of hits and for determining exactly
where a direct fire missile lands are generally the same as for indirect fire
engines, except that hits in a 15' area containing creatures too small to
target individually roll 1d3 for scatter distance. Direct fire engines roll 2d4 for
scatter distance when they miss.
<P></P>
<B>Cannons: </B>Creatures within a cannon shot’s area of effect suffer 1d4 points of damage
even if they make their saving throws. All cannons have the same basic damage
listing against creatures—1d12x5. Roll 1d12 and multiply the result by five. This
represents the possibly catastrophic effects of coming into contact with the
cannon ball or the shrapnel a cannon ball impact produces. If the 1d12 roll is 10
or higher the affected creature also must save vs. death or be killed outright
(see the Death from Massive Damage rule in Chapter 9 of the <A HREF="PHB_DD01749.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="PHB_DD01749.htm">PHB</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">).
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits and Knockdowns: </B>Only direct hits can be critical hits or cause knockdowns. If the rules from <A HREF="DD02709.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02709.htm">Chapter Six</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> are in play, cannons inflict Large bludgeoning criticals, and most ballistae
inflict Large piercing criticals. Some ballistae fire shot instead of bolts and
inflict Large bludgeoning criticals.
<P></P>
<A NAME="84042c35"></A><B>Flaming Projectiles: </B>Ballistae can be loaded with bolts tipped with wads soaked in pitch and
wrapped in cloth. The flaming bolt’s range is reduced by 1/3 and it inflicts normal
damage and 1 point of additional fire damage if it scores a direct hit. The
flame can set fire to wooden structures.
