This spell causes instant growth of a creature or object, increasing both size
and weight. It can be cast only upon a single creature (or a symbiotic or
community entity) or upon a single object that does not exceed 10 cubic feet in
volume per caster level. The object or creature must be seen to be affected. It
grows by up to 10% per level of experience of the wizard, increasing this amount
in height, width, and weight.
<P></P>
All equipment worn or carried by a creature is enlarged by the spell.
Unwilling victims are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. A successful saving throw
means the spell fails. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth,
the creature or object attains the maximum possible size, bursting weak
enclosures in the process, but it is constrained without harm by stronger
materials--the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by growth.
<P></P>
Magical properties are not increased by this spell--a huge <I>sword +1</I> is still only +1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal
functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its
magical effects operate, etc. Weight, mass, and strength are affected, though.
Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective, a hurled
stone would have more mass (and cause more damage), chains would be more massive,
doors thicker, a thin line turned to a sizeable, longer rope, and so on. A
creature's hit points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but damage
rolls increase proportionately with size.
<P></P>
For example, a fighter at 160% normal size hits with his long sword and rolls
a 6 for damage. The adjusted damage roll is 10 (that is, 6 x 1.6 = 9.6, rounded
up). Bonuses due to Strength, class, and magic are not altered.
<P></P>
The reverse spell, <I>reduce</I>, negates the <I>enlarge</I> spell or makes creatures or objects smaller. The creature or object loses 10%
of its original size for every level of the caster, to a minimum of 10% of the
original size. Thereafter, the size shrinks by 1-foot increments to less than
1 foot, by 1-inch increments to 1 inch, and by 1/10-inch increments to a
minimum of 1/10 of an inch--the recipient cannot dwindle away to nothingness.
<P></P>
For example, a 16-foot-tall giant reduced by a 15th-level wizard (15 steps)
would be reduced to 1.6 feet (in nine steps), then to 6/10 of a foot or 7.2
inches (in one step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the last five steps). A
shrinking object may damage weaker materials affixed to it, but an object will shrink
only as long as the object itself is not damaged. Unwilling creatures are
allowed a saving throw vs. spell.
<P></P>
The material component of this spell is a pinch of powdered iron.
