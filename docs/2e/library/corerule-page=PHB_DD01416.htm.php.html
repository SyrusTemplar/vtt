<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Another major difference between role-playing games and other games is the
ultimate goal. Everyone assumes that a game must have a beginning and an end and
that the end comes when someone wins. That doesn't apply to role-playing because
no one “wins” in a role-playing game. The point of playing is not to win but
to have fun and to socialize.
<P></P>
An adventure usually has a goal of some sort: protect the villagers from the
monsters; rescue the lost princess; explore the ancient ruins. Typically, this
goal can be attained in a reasonable playing time: four to eight hours is
standard. This might require the players to get together for one, two, or even three
playing sessions to reach their goal and complete the adventure.
<P></P>
But the game doesn't end when an adventure is finished. The same characters
can go on to new adventures. Such a series of adventures is called a campaign.
<P></P>
Remember, the point of an adventure is not to win but to have fun while
working toward a common goal. But the length of any particular adventure need not
impose an artificial limit on the length of the game. The AD&amp;D game embraces more
than enough adventure to keep a group of characters occupied for years.
