</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Several of the wizard kits receive reaction bonuses and penalties as part of
their special benefits and special hindrances. As noted in the <A HREF="PHB_DD01436.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01436.htm">Player's Handbook</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> (page 18), characters with very high or very low Charisma receive &quot;reaction
adjustments. &quot; A character with high Charisma gets a bonus (expressed as a plus,
such as +3), while a character with low Charisma gets a penalty (expressed as
a minus, such as -3).

When rolling 2d10 for encounter reactions (see page 103 in the <A HREF="DMG_DD00564.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00564.htm">Dungeon Master's Guide</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">), do not add the bonus or subtract the penalty from the die roll. If the
character has a Charisma of 16, thus receiving a +5 reaction adjustment, subtract
that number from the die roll-- do not add it. Otherwise, the more Charisma a
character has, the worse the reaction of the NPCs
