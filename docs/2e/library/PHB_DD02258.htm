The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route
that he is seeking, be it the way into or out of a locale. The locale can be
outdoors or under ground, a trap, or even a<I> maze</I> spell. Note that the spell works with respect to locales, not objects or
creatures within a locale. Thus, the spell could not find the way to ?a forest
where a green dragon lives? or to the location of ?a hoard of platinum pieces.? The
location must be in the same plane as the caster.
<P></P>
The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will
eventually lead him to his destination, indicating at the appropriate times the exact
path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, with concentration the
spell enables the subject to sense trip wires or the proper word to bypass a
glyph. The spell ends when the destination is reached or when one turn for each
caster level has elapsed. The spell frees the subject, and those with him, from
a<I> maze </I>spell in a single round, and will continue to do so as long as the spell lasts.
<P></P>
Note that this divination is keyed to the caster, not his companions, and
that, like the<I> find traps</I> spell, it does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures.
<P></P>
The spell requires a set of divination counters of the sort favored by the
priest--bones, ivory counters, sticks, carved runes, or whatever.
<P></P>
The reverse spell,<I> lose the path</I>, makes the creature touched totally lost and unable to find its way for the
duration of the spell--although it can be led, of course.
