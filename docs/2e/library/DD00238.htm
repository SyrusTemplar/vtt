Thieves are often people who don't fit in elsewhere. Unlike other classes,
nearly all thieves are adventurers, often by necessity. True, many settle
permanently in a single are and live off the local population, but when your life tends
to be in defiance of the local law, you have to be ready to leave at a
moment's notice! Each job is an adventure involving great risks (including, possibly,
death), and there are precious few opportunities to relax and let your guard
down.

Thieves occasionally form guilds, especially in major cities and places with a
strong sense of law and order. In many cases, they are forced to cooperate
merely to survive. Influential thieves see guilds as a way to increase their own
profits and grant them the image of respectability. They become dons and
crimelords, directing operations without ever having to dirty their hands.

At the same time, the membership of a thieves' guild is by definition composed
of liars, cheats, swindlers, and dangerously violent people. Thus, such guilds
are hotbeds of deceit, treachery, and back-stabbing (literally). Only the most
cunning and powerful rise to the top. Sometimes this rise is associated with
level ability, but more often it is a measure of the don's judge of character
and political adeptness.

Curiously, thieves who are masters of their craft tend not to advance too high
in the organization. Their talents in the field are too valuable to lose, and
their effort is expended on their art, not on maneuvering and toadying. There
is, in fact, no rule that says the leader of the thieves' guild has to be a
thief. The leader's job involves charisma, character appraisals, and
politicking--the powerful crimelord could turn out to be a crafty merchant, a well-educated
nobleman, or even an insidious mind flayer.
