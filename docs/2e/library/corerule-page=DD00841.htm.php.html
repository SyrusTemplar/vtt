<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Staff of Striking:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This oaken staff is the equivalent of a +3 magical weapon. (If the weapon vs.
armor type adjustment is used, the <I>staff of striking</I> is treated as the most favorable weapon type vs. any armor.) It causes 1d6+3
points of damage when a hit is scored. This expends a charge. If two charges
are expended, bonus damage is doubled (1d6+6); if three charges are expended,
bonus damage is tripled (1d6+9). No more than three charges can be expended per
strike. The staff can be recharged.
