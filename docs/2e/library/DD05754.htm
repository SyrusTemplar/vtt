   Rangers have much in common with druids. For instance, both classes are
predominantly oriented toward nature. Both receive spells in similar ways; in fact,
both of the ranger's spheres are shared with druids. Both strive to live up to
the tenets of a higher power. They are natural allies against raiders, evil
humanoids, and others who would despoil and ruin the land.
<P></P>
   Some rangers won't form anything other than casual relationships with druids.
They may work with them on projects of mutual interest and occasionally call on
them for guidance or advice, but otherwise the rangers go their own way,
oblivious to how druids exercise their faith and not particularly concerned with
what goes on in their places of worship. In special circumstances, however,
rangers and druids may establish more formal alliances, especially when a druid
becomes a ranger's follower.
<P></P>
   Any ranger may acquire a low-level druid as a follower, and may do so for a
variety of reasons. If the ranger is skilled in areas in which the druid is
deficient, the druid may seek him out as a teacher. The druid's superior may
instruct him to serve a ranger as part of a penance, or to serve as a go-between for a
network of wilderness protectors that exchanges information and favors. Or
like other human followers, the druid may be drawn by the ranger's reputation,
hoping for a working relationship that will allow the projects of both to prosper.
<P></P>
   Secretive and mysterious, a druid may never let on as to why he's chosen to
follow a ranger. He may simply show up, tag along, obey orders, then abruptly
disappear a few weeks later. His initial appearance may be equally cryptic; a
ranger who believes he's acquired a lizard or raccoon follower may be shocked to
discover that the animal is, in fact, a shapechanged druid.
<P></P>
   Likewise, a low-level ranger may become a follower of a druid. Though many
druids are reluctant to take on such strong-willed characters, open-minded druids
are often receptive to rangers with a thirst for nature lore and a commitment
to conservation.
<P></P>
   Most of the time, however, rangers and druids operate independently. On
occasion, they may find themselves competing for dominance of the same territory. A
novice ranger who wishes to move into a region occupied by a druid may be wise
to petition for permission, even though such permission is rarely required by
law. Failure to do so may result in lasting resentment at best, open hostility at
worst. Should the ranger act courteously and respectfully, permission is
usually granted.
<P></P>
   Conversely, an initiate assigned to a ranger's territory would do well to
request an audience with the ranger before settling in. Most rangers will
appreciate the gesture, which minimizes the likelihood of misunderstandings or
conflicts. A ranger probably won't attempt to drive away a druid who doesn't bother to
make contact--assuming that the druid otherwise behaves himself--but relations
between them may remain strained indefinitely.
<P></P>
   Because their outlooks are so similar, rangers and druids can usually share
the same territory without any trouble, though their paths may seldom cross.
Druids tend to keep to themselves even more than rangers. They are less likely than
rangers to involve themselves in the affairs of men. Since they're of neutral
alignment, druids aren't particularly interested in promoting the ranger's
conception of justice. Rangers tend to work more openly, druids more deviously.
<P></P>
   Rangers and druids may informally agree to divide the responsibilities of
their territory. The ranger may agree to deal with human and demihuman travelers,
while the druid handles the problems of the native animals. They may join forces
to contend with a natural disaster, only to part company when the danger has
passed.
