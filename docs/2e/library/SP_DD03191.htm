<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> All characters and creatures have mental armor classes (MACs). While physical
Armor Classes protect a body from physical attacks, MACs provide protection
from psionic attacks. The MAC rating ranges from minimal defense (MAC 10) to
maximum defense (MAC ?10); there are no MACs worse than 10 or better than ?10.
<P></P>
As with standard Armor Class, the higher the MAC number, the more vulnerable
the character is to psionic attack. Likewise, with all attacks, a roll of 20
always hits and a roll of 1 always misses, regardless of the target-s MAC number.

For those who have copies of <I>The Complete Psionics Handbook</I> and who want to continue using the -optional results? rules (page 28), make
the following change. A roll of a power-s MAC score gives the good result (what
used to be signified by a roll of the power score), while a roll of 1 gives the
bad result (what used to happen on a roll of 20).

To determine a base MAC number, find the character-s Wisdom score on <A HREF="DD03192.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03192.htm">Table 74</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> below. Then find the character-s Intelligence score and add the indicated MAC
modifier. MACs can be improved through proficiencies and other means, as
detailed later.
