<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Combat Actions </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Combat actions are basic strategies that a character can follow in a round of
combat. Does Argath the Brave stand his ground and wait for the orcs to come to
him, or does he charge rashly into the center of their line? Does Rowan the
Mage cast a spell or spend her round moving to a better vantage point? You decide
when you select your character’s combat action for that round.
<P></P>
There are several factors involved in choosing a combat action. It is
dangerous to do anything but attack or parry when your character is threatened by an
adjacent opponent. It’s downright useless to declare a charge when your character
is grappled by a giant constrictor snake.
<P></P>
Player characters have the right to choose any action they like in combat, as
long as they meet the basic requirements for it. (It makes no sense for a
character without magical items to announce that he will use one for his combat
action.) However, once the requirements have been met, all options are open. The DM
should not disallow a combat action except under the most extreme
circumstances. No matter how foolish or difficult something may seem, let the PC try it if
he really wants to. (Of course, the DM can assign difficulty modifiers if she
deems it necessary.)
