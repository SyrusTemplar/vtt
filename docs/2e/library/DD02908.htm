long, powerful arms. Their necks are thick and short, and their heads tend to be
broad and flat with wide jaws. Alaghi are covered from toe to crown in long,
thick hair ranging in hue from charcoal gray to reddish brown. Alaghi stand well
over six feet tall and weigh more than 300 pounds.

Most alaghi live as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers. They tend to be shy and
peaceful creatures, with a driving sense of curiosity. Alaghi love riddles and
games of strategy, especially a good game of chess. Alaghi tend to hoot and hiss
when they speak, and their fearsome size and power can often frighten people who
are not used to them.
