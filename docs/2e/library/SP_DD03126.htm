<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Irritating Personality:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This disadvantage can make it difficult for the character to obtain
cooperation and aid from others. During encounters with NPCs, the DM should require the
character to make a Wisdom/Willpower check to resist the effects of the
disadvantage. A failed check means the irritating aspects of the PC's personality rise
to the surface.

It is best to role-play the specifics of the character's behavior-is a fighter
exceptionally critical, does a wizard laugh at inappropriate times, or does a
thief behave in a very uncouth fashion? The player is free to devise the
irritating elements of the character's persona, and if encounters are role-played the
disadvantage will take care of itself.
