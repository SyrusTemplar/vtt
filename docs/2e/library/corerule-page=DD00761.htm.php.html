</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> If a player character has more than one protection scroll, the effects are
cumulative, but not the duration. Scrolls that protect against creatures do not
create an actual, physical globe. If the user forces the creature into a place
from which further retreat is impossible—a corner, for example—and then continues
forward until the creature would be within the radius of the circle, the
creature is not harmed, and the protection is considered voluntarily broken and
disappears. There is no way in which a protection scroll can be used as an
offensive weapon.
