The <I>wall of fire</I> spell brings forth an immobile, blazing curtain of magical fire of shimmering
color--violet or reddish blue. The spell creates either an opaque sheet of
flame up to one 20-foot square per level of the spellcaster, or a ring with a
radius of up to 10 feet + 5 feet per two levels of experience of the wizard. In
either form, the wall of fire is 20 feet high.
<P></P>
The wall of fire must be cast so that it is vertical with respect to the
caster. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of heat,
inflicting 2d4 points of damage upon creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of
damage upon those within 20 feet. In addition, the wall inflicts 2d6 points of
damage, plus 1 point of damage per level of the spellcaster, upon any creature
passing through it. Creatures especially subject to fire may take additional
damage, and undead always take twice normal damage. Note that attempting to catch a
moving creature with a newly-created wall of fire is difficult; a successful
saving throw enables the creature to avoid the wall, while its rate and
direction of movement determine which side of the created wall it is on. The wall of
fire lasts as long as the wizard concentrates on maintaining it, or one round per
level of experience of the wizard, in the event he does not wish to
concentrate upon it.

The material component of the spell is phosphorus.
