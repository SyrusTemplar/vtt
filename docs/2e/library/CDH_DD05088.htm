Identical in function to <I>pass without trace, pass without trace, 10' radius</I> affects everyone within 10 feet of the caster. The effect moves with the
caster, so creatures must stay within 10 feet of the caster to continue to avoid
leaving tracks. A creature who leaves the area of effect can then be tracked
normally. Creatures moving into the area of effect after casting are unaffected.
<P></P>
The material component is a sprig of pine burned to ash. Upon casting the
spell, the character scatters the powder in a circle.

<P></P>
Shape Wood </B>(Alteration)
<P></P>
<P></P>

<P></P>

<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>

<P></P>
Saving Throw: None

By means of <I>shape wood</I>, the caster can reform wood. For example, the character can cast it upon any
appropriate-sized piece of wood to fashion a wooden weapon, make a rough door,
or even create a crude figurine.
<P></P>
The spell also allows the caster to reshape an existing wooden door, perhaps
to escape imprisonment. Again, the volume of the wooden object must be
appropriate to the desired result and fit in the area of effect.
<P></P>
While a character might form a wooden coffer from a tree stump or a door from
a wooden wall, the result does not bear high-quality detail. If a shaping has
moving parts, there is a 30% chance they do not work.
<P></P>
The alteration endures permanently, at least until the wood rots or is
physically destroyed. The caster blows the material component, a pinch of fine
sawdust, over the wooden subject of the spell.
