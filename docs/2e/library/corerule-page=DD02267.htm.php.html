When this spell is cast, the subject area instantly undergoes a change from
liquid to powdery dust. Note that if the water is already muddy, the area of
effect is doubled, while if wet mud is present, the area of effect is quadrupled.
If water remains in contact with the transmuted dust, the former quickly
permeates the latter, turning the dust into silty mud. If there is not a sufficient
quantity of water to cause that effect, it simply soaks or dampens the dust
accordingly.
<P></P>
Only the liquid actually in the area of effect at the moment of spellcasting
is affected. Potions that contain water as a component part are rendered
useless. Living creatures are unaffected, except for those native to the elemental
plane of Water. Such creatures must roll a successful saving throws vs. death or
be slain. However, only one such creature can be affected by any single casting
of this spell, regardless of the creature's size or the size of the spell's
area of effect.
<P></P>
The reverse of this spell is simply a very high-powered <I>create water</I> spell that requires a pinch of normal dust as an additional material
component.
<P></P>
For either usage of the spell, other components required are diamond dust of
at least 500 gp value, a bit of sea shell, and the caster's holy symbol.
