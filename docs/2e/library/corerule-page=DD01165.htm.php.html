Magical items aren’t the only source of magical inflation in a campaign.
High-level spellcasters can become unstoppable engines of destruction if the DM
allows them to simply dump out their full complement of spells every adventure.
Remember that memorizing a spell requires a good night’s sleep and 10 minutes of
prayer or study per level of the spell; a 20th-level wizard requires 18 hours of
study time to memorize a full complement of spells. By contrast, it only takes
37 minutes for the same wizard to cast every spell in memory.
