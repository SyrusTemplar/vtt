To make an attack roll, the character's THAC0 must be known. This depends on
the group and level, if the attacker is a player character or NPC, or the Hit
Dice if the attacker is a monster or an animal. All 1st-level characters have
THAC0s of 20.
<P></P>
For a character of level 1 through level 20, consult <A HREF="DD00397.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00397.htm">Table 38</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> . This table lists the THAC0 number of each group through 20th level, so
players don't have to perform any calculations.
<P></P>
For a character higher than 20th level, find the Improvement Rate for the
character's group in <A HREF="DD00396.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00396.htm">Table 37</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> . There you'll find the number of levels a character must advance to reduce
his THAC0 by 1 or more points. Calculate the character's THAC0 according to his
level. A priest, for example, improves by two for every three levels he
advances. A 5th level cleric would have a THAC0 of 18. A rogue (a thief or bard)
improves one point every two levels. A 17th-level rogue would have a THAC0 of 12. <A HREF="DD00397.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00397.htm">Table 38</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> lists the THAC0 number of each group at each level.
<P></P>
Creatures do not have character classes and levels, so they calculate THAC0s
differently, basing it on the Hit Dice of the creature. <A HREF="DD00398.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00398.htm">Table 39</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> lists the THAC0 number for monsters having various numbers of Hit Dice. When
a creature has three or more points added to its Hit Dice, count another die
when consulting the table.
