Whether these are temples, fortresses, vaults, inns, palaces, or mansions, the
buildings in a thiefly environment should be well detailed. Determine, as much
as possible, details such as window placement, even on higher floors.
<P></P>
Features of construction can be important; a brick wall may prove easier to
climb than a surface of smooth plaster. Are there trees or clinging vines near
the walls? Are the grounds well-maintained? (Many a thief has failed a move
silently check because the leaves rustled beneath his feet!)
<P></P>
Add entertaining features to your buildings such as balconies, atriums, wide
stairways with railings, chandeliers, swimming pools, secret passages, and so
on. Hanging draperies can make wonderful emergency transportation, and a wine
cellar, icehouse, or other specialized room can also be put to interesting use.
<P></P>
Experiment with unusual settings as well-just because your thieves adventure
in a social environment doesn't mean that you can't put a dungeon under a
noble's manor, or a hidden cavern leading to and from the lair of a rival band of
thieves. After the PCs have plundered several houses, you might offer a tower or a
pyramid for a change of pace.
<P></P>
Insomuch as a great portion of a thief's career might be spent skulking about
the buildings of the campaign world, it is well worth the DM's time to prepare
them carefully and imaginatively.
