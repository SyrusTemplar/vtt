The most crucial decision a beginning wizard must make is whether to
specialize in a school of magic or instead opt for the life of a mage. Each has its
advantages and disadvantages. For instance, the mage has a chance to learn any new
spell he encounters, but the specialist's opportunities are more limited -- he
cannot learn spells from schools that are in opposition to his own. The
specialist has stricter racial and ability requirements than the mage, but he also has
better saving throw bonuses.

The choice to specialize can have profound effects on a wizard's role in the
game, and players should think carefully before committing their characters to a
school of magic. Following are a few points to consider.
