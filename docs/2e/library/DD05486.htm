It could be that confirmations other than coronation are the special province
of one priesthood. For example, in one nation, any priest might perform
marriages for commoners, but only the priests of a specific god might perform
marriages for nobles.
<P></P>
This would give that priesthood great power, because by collectively deciding
or refusing to marry certain couples, this priesthood has the power to
influence which families unite and which do not.
<P></P>
Again, abuse of this right could lead to harm, but careful application of it
would allow the priesthood to affect the growth and development of the nation.
