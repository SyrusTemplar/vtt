By means of this spell, the caster is able to cause a beam of soft, pale light
to strike down from overhead and illuminate whatever area he is pointing at.
The light is exactly the same as moonlight, so that colors other than shades of
black, gray, or white are vague. The spellcaster can easily make the moonbeam
move to any area that he can see and point to. This makes the spell an effective
way to spotlight something, an opponent, for example. While the<I> moonbeam</I> spell does not eliminate all shadows, a creature centered in a moonbeam is
most certainly visible. The reflected light from this spell enables dim visual
perception 10 yards beyond the area of effect, but it does not shed a telltale
glow that would negate surprise. The light does not adversely affect infravision.
The caster can dim the beam to near darkness if desired. The beam has, in
addition, all the properties of true moonlight and can induce a lycanthropic change
(of a creature in the beam), unless the DM rules otherwise.

The material components are several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of
opalescent feldspar (moonstone).
