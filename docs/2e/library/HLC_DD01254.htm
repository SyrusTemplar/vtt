<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> In addition to just feeling rotten-and facing death if not cured-the victim
also suffers one to four of the following effects. Other effects are possible.
<P></P>
<I>Ability Score Reduction:</I> One or all of the character's ability scores are reduced by one to five
points.
<P></P>
<I>Blindness:</I> The victim's vision blurs or the characters eyes swell shut. The character
cannot cast spells or use missile weapons, and he suffers the standard penalties
for blindness when moving or engaged in melee. A<I> cure blindness</I> spell has no effect,
<P></P>
<I>Chills:</I> The character shivers uncontrollably for 2d4 rounds. During this time, the
character cannot move, attack, or cast spells. All saving throws and ability
checks suffer a ?4 penalty. The chills recur from time to time; roll again on the
onset column to see how soon.
<P></P>
<I>Delirium:</I> The victim's head spins with weird visions and confused thoughts. The
character acts as though afflicted by a <I>confusion</I> spell. Once each turn, the victim can snap out of the delirium by rolling a 9
or less on 1d20. The victim's hit point adjustment (from Constitution/Health)
applies as a bonus or penalty to the roll. Non-warrior characters with
Constitution scores of 17 or higher can claim the warrior hit point adjustment for
purposes of this roll.
<P></P>
<I>Fever:</I> The character must rest in bed. If forced into action, the character-s
stamina is severely tested and he must roll a 9 or less on 1d20 each hour to stay
conscious. The character's hit probability adjustment applies as a bonus or
penalty to the roll. If the character has a Stamina statistic, use that score to
determine the character's adjustment to the roll, otherwise use Strength. If the
roll fails, the character suffers <I>delirium</I> (as above) for 2d4 rounds and then falls into a stupor for 2d4 hours.
<P></P>
<I>Paralyzation:</I> The character loses the use of one appendage or becomes totally immobile.
<P></P>
<I>Slow healing:</I> The character cannot benefit from healing spells and heals naturally at 10%
of the normal rate.
