This spell creates a wall of granite rock that merges into adjoining rock
surfaces. It is typically employed to close passages, portals, and breaches against
opponents. The wall of stone is 0.25 inch thick and up to 20 square feet per
level of experience of the wizard casting the spell. Thus, a 12th-level wizard
can create a wall of stone 3 inches thick and up to 240 square feet in surface
area (a 12-foot-wide and 20-foot-high wall, for example, to completely close a
10-foot x 16-foot passage). The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon
any firm foundation (see the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02012.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02012.htm.php.html">wall of iron</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> spell); however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing
stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use,
if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This
requirement reduces the area of effect by half. Thus, a 20th-level caster can
create a span with a surface area of 200 square feet. The wall can be crudely
shaped to allow crenelations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the
area. The stone is permanent unless destroyed by a <I>dispel magic</I> or <I>disintegrate</I> spell, or by normal means such as breaking or chipping.
