A mysterious lone wolf, freelance thief has struck the characters'
neighborhood, leaving his trademark blue hand symbol at the scene of each crime. He is
very successful, and has overshadowed many of the local guild's best thieves, on
their own territory. The player characters (presumably connected with the guild)
are commanded by their guildmaster to track down this unauthorized thief,
either to coerce him to join the guild or to leave the city, or if necessary,
eliminate him.
<P></P>
The thief is, of course, &quot;Bluehand&quot; Ajathar. The characters may be very
surprised to find themselves up against this strange, illusion-casting thief.
Ajathar's description and level should be fleshed out suitably to challenge the
character party.
