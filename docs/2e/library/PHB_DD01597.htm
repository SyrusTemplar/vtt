<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Stonemasonry:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A stonemason is able to build structures from stone so that they last many
years. He can do simple stone carvings, such as lettering, columns, and
flourishes. The stone can be mortared, carefully fitted without mortar, or loosely fitted
and chinked with rocks and earth. A stonemason equipped with his tools
(hammers, chisels, wedges, block and tackle) can build a plain section of wall one
foot thick, ten feet long, and five feet high in one day, provided the stone has
already been cut. A stonemason can also supervise the work of unskilled laborers
to quarry stone; one stonemason is needed for every five laborers. Dwarves are
among the most accomplished stonemasons in the world; they receive a +2 bonus
when using this skill.
