?? Ambitious players may design entirely new kits, using the examples in this
chapter as guidelines. Before going to the trouble of designing a kit from
scratch, check the exiting kits and see if any can be modified to fit the type you
have in mind. If not, copy the Paladin Kit Record Sheet in the back of this book,
fill out the description, then write down all the information needed in each
section. Refer to the Kit Subsections descriptions at the beginning of this
chapter if necessary.
<P></P>
?? When you've finished with the Record Sheet, let your DM look it over. He may
veto some ideas or suggest different ones to make sure that characters taking
the new kit aren't too powerful or that the kit doesn't duplicate concepts from
existing kits. The DM may make additional adjustments after he sees how the kit
works in the context of a campaign.
<P></P>
?? Need some ideas? Consider these:
<P></P>
<B>?? Almsman.</B> A treasure hunter and philanthropist, he acquires money for needy charities
and distributes funds to the underprivileged.
<P></P>
<B>?? Cursed Paladin.</B> This unfortunate must wrestle with the consequences of a vile curse or hex
placed upon his family, ever seeking a way to break it with the least harm to
others.
<P></P>
<B>?? Elemental Paladin.</B> Instead of acquiring a bonded mount, he can summon a free-willed elemental
once per week for an hour.
<P></P>
<B>?? Foreteller.</B> He has an uncanny knack of seeing into the future and better access to spells
of the Divination Sphere.
<P></P>
<B>?? Gallant.</B> A charming aesthete who finds truth and beauty in poetry, art, and romance.
<P></P>
<B>?? Outlander.</B> One of the few surviving paladins of a lost kingdom, he attempts to pursue a
life of service in a world that neither understands nor trusts him.
<P></P>
<B>?? Pacifist.</B> He opposes war and violence in all forms, and advocates peaceful solutions to
conflicts. He seeks alternatives to killing evil characters and creatures.
<P></P>
<B>?? Seaguard.</B> A ship-riding paladin, he is a defender of the sea and all its inhabitants.
Seaguards often lead units of marines.
