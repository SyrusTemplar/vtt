<B>Specialty: </B>Trickster/Con Artist.
<P></P>
<B>Qualifications: </B>Standard ability scores. Charlatans live off the fat of the land, bending all
the rules and hopping through loopholes in the law. It is completely against
the personality of the Charlatan to be lawful. Charlatans are limited to NG, N,
NE, or CN alignments. Gnomes may become Charlatans and advance up to 6th level.
<P></P>
<B>Introduction:</B> <I>My real name is Tiel, but most of the fools who fall into my traps call me
Tori. I know exactly how to get what I want from others. Especially those who are
overconfident, weak, or emotional.
<P></P>
People often believe what they want to believe, and I take advantage of this.
I know how to swindle these simple-minded fools and make them feel good about
it.
<P></P>
I have many disguises with which to cloak my activities. My favorite is that
of a cleric of Tyr. Of course, none of my ruses has ever been uncovered, and
it's a good thing. There's a saying: &quot;There are two types of Charlatans-those who
are good and those who are dead.&quot;
<P></P>
I usually don't stay in one place for very long; it's not safe. By the time
the poor fool I've tricked has figured out what happened, I'm long gone.
<P></P>
Once, I agreed to watch over the castle of a good &quot;friend,&quot; the rapacious Sir
John of Canters, while he went off on a quest. I sold the castle and made off
with all the loot before he returned. For now, I am performing sleight-of-hand
tricks for mere pocket coins until I meet another &quot;friend.&quot; Perhaps tomorrow I
will be a powerful mage or a war hero.
<P></P>
I thrive in cities and towns where victims are plentiful and easy to
manipulate. Lately, I have been considering the possibility of posing as a thief. Why?
So I can accompany a party of adventures in a quest and collect my &quot;share&quot; of
the treasure.
<P></P>
</I> <B>Description:</B> Charlatans are masters at manipulating people. Using their high Intelligence
and understanding of human nature, Charlatans prey upon the foolish,
overconfident, and greedy people around them.
<P></P>
Charlatans often seem bold and boisterous, but they always maintain
self-control. The profession of swindling others and making them feel good about it is an
age-old practice and none are better at it than Charlatans.
<P></P>
The Charlatan's profession has its downside, too. When a Charlatan's facade is
pierced, he is in grave danger, for no one likes to be conned. Then the
Charlatan's quick feet may serve him better than his quick wit.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> Charlatans are wanderers. They go from town to town, switching from one
identity to another, always a step ahead of the last person they swindled. In large
cities, Charlatans may be able to live out most of their lives moving from one
quarter to the next. When times are tough and no great con comes to mind,
Charlatans sometimes perform sleight-of-hand tricks just to get by. Charlatans also
have a knack for acquiring jobs that allow them to bluff their way through each
day. Charlatans can sometimes be found masquerading as priests, healers,
sages, diplomats, powerful mages, and retired heroes.
<P></P>
As player characters, Charlatans are most useful in town-based campaigns or
when traveling across inhabited country. Their talents often support the entire
party with food, shelter, and minor luxuries. Unfortunately, many of their
talents have little use when exploring ruins or wilderness areas. However, they
often pose as wizards, warriors, thieves, and sometimes even priests. As NPCs,
Charlatans really come into their own.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> Charlatans can have any secondary skill. However, well over half of all
Charlatans are gamblers, jewelers, or limner/painters, for these skills help fill
their coin purses in lean times.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Charlatans must take dagger, short sword, or long sword as one of their
initial weapon proficiencies, as these weapons are used in so many roles that they
shouldn't be passed over. At least every second weapon proficiency gained must
be one of these three until they are all selected.
<P></P>
A Charlatan selects the rest of his weapons to fill the needs of various
roles. For example, if Charlatan decides to masquerade as a powerful warrior, he
arms himself with a heavy combat weapon (a two-handed sword, polearm, long bow, or
a battle axe) and spends a proficiency slot learning it. This way he can
appear to be a skilled and tough fighter. The Charlatan always uses his proficient
weapon in dire situations. If an encounter is less threatening, the Charlatan
uses one of the other weapons so as to appear to be a well-rounded fighter (the
-3 non-proficiency penalty is easier to hide when attacking monsters with poor
Armor Classes).
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonuses:</I> Acting, Disguise, Forgery, Gaming. <I>Suggested:</I> Appraising, Astrology, Healing, Herbalism, Juggling, Reading Lips, Religion,
Rope Use, Singing, Ventriloquism.
<P></P>
<B>Armor/Equipment:</B> A Charlatan is allowed to wear any type of armor if a role requires it. Thus,
a Charlatan masquerading as a paladin can wear plate mail and carry a shield.
But a Charlatan is a finesse character; heavy, bulky armor goes against the
grain of his personality. No Charlatan will maintain a role that requires him to
wear non-bard armor for more than a few weeks.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B>
<P></P>
<I>Charm:</I> Charlatans are aware of their unique charm and flair. They have learned to
use this gift to sway the reactions of others. However, such charm must be
carefully tailored to a specific audience. Charlatans can affect only a small group
of people, no larger in number than their current level.
<P></P>
To be charmed, a group must be in average to high spirits. (You can't charm a
merchant who's just been robbed.) The Charlatan must mingle among the intended
group and chat for at least 1d10 rounds. After this time, those in the group
roll a saving throw vs. paralyzation with a penalty of -1 per three levels of the
Charlatan. Those who succeed are unimpressed with the Charlatan and may even
find him to be an irritation. If they succeed on a natural 20, they see through
the Charlatan's facade.
<P></P>
Those who fail have been caught up in the Charlatan's tales and find him to be
a most remarkable person. The effects of the charm are identical to the wizard
spell of the same name. However, it is not magical in any way, and future
saving throws are not made based on Intelligence and time. Rather, every time the
Charlatan stresses the relationship-by calling for a favor, or requesting
delicate information-the paralyzation saving throw is rerolled. The DM can give
bonuses or penalties depending on how much stress the request puts on the
relationship.
<P></P>
<I>Masquerade:</I> The ability of masquerading requires much study, time, and effort on the part
of the Charlatan. This enables a Charlatan to appear to have a specific skill.
This is not a disguise, as the proficiency of that name. Rather, it is the
ability to appear proficient at the chosen skill. The character picks up the
language ('buzz words'), professional mannerisms, and general techniques to help him
in his endeavor.
<P></P>
Unlike the True Bard, the Charlatan only appears to be a jack-of-all trades.
He does not study skills to use them, but for the sake of conning others into
believing he has them.
<P></P>
The use of this ability is resolved by the DM in much the same manner as an
illusion spell. If the performance is not overly suspicious and the characters
watching have no reason to disbelieve the bard's ability, then the attempt
appears genuine. Otherwise, a saving throw vs. paralyzation is rolled with a -1
penalty per three levels of the Charlatan. Those who succeed realize that the
Charlatan is a fraud.
<P></P>
A Charlatan can use his masquerade ability to fake any nonweapon proficiency
or secondary skill. Furthermore, if the Charlatan rolls a successful
Intelligence check with a -10 penalty, he actually functions as if he really knows the
skill or proficiency (for this one check only). Thus, a Charlatan can actually
succeed just enough to keep skeptics satisfied.
<P></P>
For example, if Tiel is masquerading as a cleric, she can claim to know the
healing proficiency even though she doesn't really have it. Unless those she
heals are suspicious, they will believe that the attempts are genuine (if they are
suspicious, roll as described two paragraphs prior to this one). First Tiel's
player rolls an Intelligence check with a -10 penalty. If that roll succeeds,
she next rolls a healing proficiency check. If this check also succeeds, the
patient is healed of 1d3 points of damage. If the Intelligence check fails,
everyone watching rolls a saving throw vs. paralyzation (with a -1 penalty per three
levels of the Charlatan) to notice that the Charlatan is a fraud. If the
Intelligence check succeeds but the healing check fails, the patient and onlookers
notice only that a valid attempt was made but it just didn't help.
<P></P>
Each time Tiel masquerades as a healer, an Intelligence check is rolled with a
-10 penalty. If the check succeeds, a successful healing proficiency check
will actually heal 1d3 points of damage.
<P></P>
<I>Detect Fakery:</I> Because Charlatans are so skilled at faking their personalities, lying, and
concealing their feelings and reactions, they can see right through false
personae and verbal trickery when others attempt them. As the old saying goes, &quot;You
can't con a con man.&quot; Any time a Charlatan player requests it, he can try to
determine if someone is lying, operating under false pretenses (including a
masquerade), or swindling him. A Charisma check is rolled. Success means the
Charlatan realizes the deception.
<P></P>
Furthermore, a Charisma check with a -10 penalty enables the Charlatan to
determine a person's alignment. This requires that the Charlatan speak with and
observe the individual for 1d10 rounds.
<P></P>
<I>Swindling:</I> Major cons, such as duping a king into believing that you are a highly
respected sage, drawing him into your inner confidence, and then relieving him of the
crown jewels, should be done only through role-playing. However, Charlatans
hone such skills by constantly performing minor swindles and tricks. These are
far too numerous and insignificant to role-play every time. Swindling covers this
aspect of a Charlatan's skill repertoire.
<P></P>
By performing various cons, sleight-of-hand, and other deceptions, a Charlatan
is often able to walk away from a merchant with far more than a fair deal. The
same is true of any common outlay of coins, such as buying meals at a tavern,
paying for a room at an inn, and purchasing ordinary items. In instances like
these, the Charlatan makes a pick pockets roll. If successful, the cost of the
item is reduced to the percentage rolled; this is what the Charlatan pays. If
the roll fails by more than the Charlatan's Charisma, the con is seen through.
Swindle rolls above 95 are always detected by the victim.
<P></P>
For example, Tiel tries to swindle a barkeeper for a 10-gp glass of imported
wine (Tiel has only six gold coins left). Tiel's pick pockets roll is a 53 and
she has a Charisma of 16. She rolls a 25 and swindles her way into paying only
two gold and one electrum for the wine (25% of the original cost). If she had
rolled a 54-69 the barkeeper would have noticed the error and politely requested
the remainder of the money. On a 70 or above the barkeeper would not only have
noticed the error, but he would have realized that Tiel tried to swindle him
(with unpleasant consequences for Tiel).
<P></P>
Swindling rolls should not be used for amounts in excess of 10 gp per level of
the Charlatan. Such grand swindles require full role-playing.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> None.
