<P></P>
While some wizards are self-taught and some acquire their skills from a
private tutor, many wizards learn the art of magic at a training academy. Most large
cities have such academies; some specializing in a particular school of magic,
while others offer training in all of the schools. Usually, there are a minimum
of three requirements for admission to an academy.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
All applicants to an academy must be recommended by a sponsor known by one or
more of the faculty members. Exceptions are made if an applicant is an orphan
or demonstrates extraordinary aptitude, but in these cases, a faculty member
must agree to sponsor the applicant; the faculty sponsor is then personally held
responsible for the applicant's failure or success.

<P></P>

<P></P>
Because training a wizard requires a major investment of time and effort,
academies screen their applicants carefully to make certain that a prospective
student is sufficiently dedicated to persevere through years of rigorous education.
Typically, a panel of faculty members interviews each applicant individually,
quizzing him at length about his background, his interests, and his reasons for
wanting to become a wizard. The panel then votes in secret; a single negative
vote results in the rejection of the applicant.

<P></P>

<P></P>
Following a prospective student's successful interview, he is given a battery
of examinations to measure his aptitude in a variety of academic areas. The
student must demonstrate a basic competence in philosophy, literature, and
history, and exceptional skills in writing, science, and mathematics. He must also
pass a physical examination to make sure he is in good health.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
If a prospective student passes his entrance examinations, he must then make
arrangements with the academy administration to pay tuition fees. The tuition
fee ranges from 5-20 gp per day, depending on the academy's reputation. The
tuition can be paid daily, weekly, or monthly, but it must be paid in advance.
Failure to pay tuition results in immediate suspension, unless the student has made
previous arrangements with the administration.
<P></P>
The tuition covers the cost of books, laboratory fees, faculty salaries, and
room and board, but it does not include expenses for spell components, research
materials, or damage caused by the student in his research. Occasionally,
scholarships are available for unusually promising students.
<P></P>
After a student is admitted to an academy, he must undergo a probationary
period lasting a minimum of six months. During this time, the student's classroom
performance is evaluated on a weekly basis and his behavior both on and off
campus is closely monitored. If the student is not performing adequately in the
opinion of any faculty member or adminstrator, he may be dimissed from the
academy. Except in the most extreme circumstances, he is not eligible to apply for
readmission. No amount of the tuition paid prior to his dismissal is refundable.
