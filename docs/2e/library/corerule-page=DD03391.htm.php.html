energies that provide various forms of protection to himself and his companions. A
wizard must have strength of will to master this school of magic, so a high

Abjurers enjoy the normal benefits and hindrances of specialist wizards. In
addition, at 8th level the abjurer gains a +1 bonus to saving throws vs.
paralyzation, poison, and death magic. At 11th level an abjurer’s base Armor Class
improves by 1 point due to his command of protective magic, and at 14th level the
abjurer gains immunity to all forms of <I>hold </I>spells.

Abjurers have few spells that can directly inflict damage, but their
protective enchantments can help them protect their comrades from harm in battle. They
are also extremely effective against enemy spellcasters and creatures of
extraplanar or unusual origins.
