<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ambidexterity:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> This character is equally skilled with the use of either hand. This trait
carries over into training, so that the PC can use weapons, bear a shield, and
perform acts of strength equally well with the right or left hand. The character
is good at the two weapon fighting style, suffering no penalty for the first
hand, and only a â€“2 penalty for off-hand use.
