This is a god of nature who is devoted specifically to plant-life. He is an
admirer of vast forests and plains and all sorts of plant growth, especially that
which is wild and not fettered or trimmed or tamed by mankind.
<P></P>
Priests of the god try to make sure that there are always tracts of wilderness
in abundance for the god to admire. They work hard to keep civilization from
making inroads too deep into wilderness. They do this by spreading tales of the
forest as a deep and dangerous place. They often sneak around in the wilderness
using their spells on travelling city-folk, or stock the forest with dangerous
animals, in order to reinforce this impression. They do not impede those who
know the forest (elves, gnomes, rangers, hunters, trappers, woodsmen), but will
terrorize innocents and city-soft travellers.
