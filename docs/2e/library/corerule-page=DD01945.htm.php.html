This spell can be cast in one of two forms: a warm shield that protects
against cold-based attacks, or a chill shield that protects against fire-based
attacks. Both return damage to creatures making physical attacks against the wizard.
The wizard must choose which variation he memorizes when the spell is selected.
<P></P>
When casting this spell, the wizard appears to immolate himself, but the
flames are thin and wispy, shedding no heat, and giving light equal to only half the
illumination of a normal torch. The color of the flames is determined randomly
(50% chance of either color)--blue or green if the chill shield is cast,
violet or blue if the warm shield is employed. The special powers of each shield are
as follows:
<P></P>
A) <I>Warm shield.</I> The flames are warm to the touch. Any cold-based attacks are saved against
with a +2 bonus; either half normal damage or no damage is sustained. There is no
bonus against fire-based attacks, but if the wizard fails to make the required
saving throw (if any) against them, he sustains double normal damage.
<P></P>
The material component for this variation is a bit of phosphorous.
<P></P>
B)<I> Chill shield.</I> The flames are cool to the touch. Any fire-based attacks are saved against
with a +2 bonus; either half normal damage or no damage is sustained. There is no
bonus against cold-based attacks, but if the wizard fails to make the required
saving throw (if any) against them, he sustains double normal damage.
<P></P>
The material component for this variation is a live firefly or glow worm or
the tail portions of four dead ones.
<P></P>
Any creature striking the spellcaster with its body or hand-held weapons
inflicts normal damage upon the wizard, but the attacker suffers the same amount of
damage. An attacker's magical resistance, if any, is tested when the creature
actually strikes the wizard. Successful resistance shatters the spell. Failure
means the creature's magic resistance does not affect that casting of the spell.
