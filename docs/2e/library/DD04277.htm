This spell is a sensitive version of the wizard spell <I>ESP</I>. In addition to detecting the surface thoughts of any creatures in range, the
priest is able to probe deeper into the mind of a single creature. <I>Mind read</I> will always reveal the kind of creature being probed, although this identity
may be couched in the creature's own language or in a (possibly distorted) body
image. The spell has a 20% chance of revealing the character class of an
individual.
<P></P>
The details and the usefulness of the creature's thoughts will depend on the
intelligence of the subject. While a priest could read the thoughts of an
animal, he would probably receive only a confused jumble of emotions and instincts.
Reading the mind of a highly intelligent wizard, however, would be much more
illuminating; the priest might be amazed by the crystal clarity and deep insight
of the wizard's mental processes.
<P></P>
If <I>mind read</I> is used as part of an interrogation, an intelligent and wary subject receives
a saving throw at a -2 penalty. If successful, the creature resists the
spell's effects and the priest learns no information. If the saving throw is failed,
the priest may learn additional information according to the DM's ruling.
