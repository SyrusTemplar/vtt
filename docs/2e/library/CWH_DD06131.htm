<B> Description:</B> The Peasant Wizard is a spell caster of modest means whose exceptional skills
and matchless courage have made him a champion of the masses. Though his
talents have set him apart and made him a legend in his homeland, he will never
forget his roots. An advocate of the commoner, the Peasant Wizard devotes himself
to the promotion of equality and justice. The Peasant Wizard is the most
frequently encountered of all the wizards. There are no additional ability
requirements for the Peasant Wizard. No special rules exist for abandoning this kit.
<P></P>
<B>Preferred Schools:</B> There are no preferred schools for the Peasant Wizard, though illusionists,
abjurers, and invokers are among the most frequently encountered.
<P></P>
<B>Barred Schools:</B> There are no barred schools for the Peasant Wizard; however, there are fewer
necromancers and diviners than any other specialist.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> The Peasant Wizard fights on behalf of the common people. He considers
himself protector of the helpless, actively opposing any action from the party that
threatens or exploits the peasants. For instance, he won't allow his party to
recruit peasants for combat support unless they fully understand the risks
involved. When a companion of the Peasant Wizard bargains with a common man for goods
or services, the Peasant Wizard makes sure his companion pays the common man a
fair price. When the party recovers a treasure, the Peasant Wizard demands
that the local citizens receive their fair share if they helped the party in any
way or if the treasure was recovered on their land.
<P></P>
The Peasant Wizard sees the wealthy classes as a primary reason for the
commoners' miseries, so he has little respect or patience for noblemen and the
wealthy. Aside from the occasional insult, the Peasant Wizard is likely to avoid
associating with any Patricians in his party.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> The player may choose his Peasant Wizard's secondary skill. The DM might
consider limiting this choice to skills that are useful to peasants such as
swimming; it is unlikely (but not impossible) that a peasant wizard could learn
heraldry or etiquette.

limitations described in the Special Hindrances entry below.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> When in his homeland, the Peasant Wizard will always be given food and
shelter at no charge from his fellow commoners. This courtesy extends to the Peasant
Wizard's companions, as long as he vouches for them. The Peasant Wizard does
not receive this benefit in lands other than his own, but he always receives a +2
reaction modifier from peasants in any culture.
