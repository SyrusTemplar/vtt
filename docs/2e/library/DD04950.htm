<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Introduction:</B> This is a typical bard right out

Handbook</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. No introductions are needed.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Description:</B> Bards are described in the <I>Player's
Handbook.</I> They are the epitome of the jack-of-all-trades, able
to wield all weapons, don most types of armor, cast a good number of
wizard spells, and employ four of the eight thief skills. Bards are
very versatile, but they are masters of no craft.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">As with all bards, True Bards are entertainers. They
can sing, play instruments, create and recite poetry, and spin tall
tales. In fact, a bard's skill at these art forms is such that he can
inspire and rally allies and even negate the effects of hostile songs
and sounds.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Bards are always able to read and write their native
language. They know much about local history, and they can relate
legends pertaining to many of the powerful magical items they
encounter in their travels.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Bards are tremendous listeners, readers, and
searchers. They eagerly listen to any news and stories that folk are
willing to tell. If there's anything available for a bard to learn,
he'll learn it as soon as he can.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Role:</B> Bards are excellent characters to play in
small gaming groups. Their varied skills enable them to fill in for
many more-specialized characters. For example, a bard could serve as
a small group's wizard and thief. They are great survivalists, as
they can almost always find some skill to help them out of any
predicament they fall into.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Secondary Skills:</B> True Bards may select any
secondary skill.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Bards are unrestricted as
to weaponry, but they rarely carry around bulky weapons, even if they
are proficient with them. A bard seen carrying a two-handed sword or
halberd is likely to arouse suspicions about his intentions. A bard
with an elegant bow across his back, however, does not draw as much
attention. A finely crafted weapon even adds a touch of class to the
bard's appearance.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonuses:</I>
Singing, Musical Instrument, Reading/Writing (native tongue), Local History.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Other proficiencies may be selected as desired. For
every additional proficiency slot spent in the musical instrument
proficiency, bards not only increase their ability, but they also
gain the use of two more instruments. A bard initially knows how to
play one instrument (of the player's choosing). If a second
proficiency slot is used for musical instruments, the bard can now
accompany himself on three instruments.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Armor/Equipment:</B> The bard can use any weapon.
He can wear any armor up to, and including, chain mail, but he cannot
use a shield. True Bards generally wear bright, cheerful colors,
sometimes wearing plumed hats to complete the ensemble. Their
instruments, clothing, and other equipment are all kept in top condition.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Special Benefits:</B> <I>Influence Reactions:</I>
When performing for an audience, the bard can attempt to alter the
mood of his listeners. Such an audience must not be attacking or
preparing for an immediate attack. The bard must be singing,
chanting, spinning a tale, reciting a powerful oratory, or playing a
tune on an instrument with which he is proficient. The intended
effect of the performance is determined by the bard's player; he may
want to make the audience friendlier or more hostile, for instance.
After a length of time (1d10 rounds is suggested), all NPCs able to
hear the performance (regardless of whether or not they are paying
attention) must roll a saving throw vs. paralyzation. For small
groups, roll individual saving throws. For large groups, the DM may
split the audience into groups of ten or so and roll a separate
saving throw for each group. There is a -1 penalty to the saving
throw for every three levels of experience of the bard. Those failing
the roll have their reactions adjusted one level (from friendly to
indifferent, for example) in the desired direction--consult </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="DMG_DD00564.htm">Table
59</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">: Encounter Reactions, in the <I>DMG</I>.
Those whose saving throws succeed have their reactions adjusted one
level in the direction opposite from that intended by the bard.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>Rally Allies:</I> To use this ability, the bard
must know the nature of the upcoming combat. A bard can't rally
allies if there is no obvious opponent. Rallying allies is done is
much the same manner as influencing reactions. The bard sings heroic
songs or weaves inspiring tales about how his comrades will overcome
their foes and win the day. Such heroic recitals always take at least
three rounds, and the audience must be in close proximity to the bard
for the effects to occur (within a 10-foot radius per level of the
bard). When complete, all the affected allies automatically receive
one of the following three benefits (as decided by the bard's
player): +1 to attack rolls, +1 to saving throws, or +2 to morale.
The chosen effect lasts one round per level of the bard. The effects
can be renewed by the bard, even during the same encounter, but
combatants have to return to within the bard's radius and listen to
his tales for another three rounds. It is impossible to rally allies
who are actively battling opponents.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Note that the benefit applies only to the specific
encounter that the bard sings about. It does not apply to a ranger
who hears the tale, rides off on his horse to warn the rear guard,
and is then ambushed by wandering bandits.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>Counter Song:</I> Another powerful use of story,
song, or tale when voiced by a bard is that of counter song. This is
the intricate art of canceling the effects of hostile sound, whether
it be songs, chants, wails, or even commands and suggestions from
magical spells. In order to sing the proper counter song or chant the
proper counter poem, a bard must concentrate intensely. He may
perform no additional actions other than a slow (half speed) walk. If
he is struck by an attack or fails a saving throw, his attempt is
ruined. The exertion is such that only one counter song may be
attempted per encounter or battle.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Success of the counter song is realized only if the
bard rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell. If this is
successful, the hostile sounds have no effects within 30 feet of the
bard. If the saving throw fails, the bard's attempt is fruitless and
the hostile sounds have their standard effects (applicable saving
throws and other defenses still apply).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Counter singing does not prevent hostile spellcasters
from reading scrolls, using magical item command words, or casting
spells (even spells with verbal components). Counter singing does
prevent all other hostile sounds from functioning, including spell
effects that require the caster to speak (e.g., <I>command, quest,
suggestion, tongues</I>, etc.).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>Legend Lore:</I> One of the most useful abilities
of the bard is his knowledge of famous magical items and uncanny
knack for figuring out how they function. To perform legend lore, the
bard must scrutinize the item closely. This does not necessarily
require actually handling the item, but it must be fully visible to
the bard.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Scrutiny takes 1d10 rounds, after which a percentile
roll is made. The bard has a 5% chance per level of knowing something
about the item. The exact information revealed is up to the DM. The
bard draws upon history, rumors, and clues based on the item's
construction to gain this information. Typical information revealed
includes the item's history, maker, name, and other less technical
aspects. Information such as the number of pluses, exact command
words, etc., are rarely learned. This type of specific information is
left for spells, such as<I> identify, commune, limited wish</I>, and
so on.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">A good optional rule is to give some very specific
information to the bard player if the roll is equal to or less than
the bard's level. Furthermore, if the roll is 01, the bard should
know almost everything there is to know about the item.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">If the DM allows it, the following table may be used
as a fast optional method to determine what is known about an item
that was successfully examined by a bard. To use this table, the bard
must first succeed with the legend lore percentile roll. If this roll
succeeds, the player should roll on the following table once per
level of the bard. Results that come up more than once are not
rerolled; the bard simply knows a lot about this aspect of the item.
After rolling, give the DM some time to come up with a suitable
background and history. Few items are detailed with this type of
information. After all, bards tend to be more curious about the
legends and lore that lie behind an item's powers than most others.</FONT></P>
