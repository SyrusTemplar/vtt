</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A character with this skill is well versed in the lore of undead creatures.
This proficiency may be used to help determine the probable lairs, dining habits,
and history of such creatures (no ability check needed). Whenever a character
with this skill confronts an undead, he or she may be able to specifically
identify the creature (discerning between a ghast and a common ghoul, for
instance). In addition, providing the character makes another successful ability check,
he or she recalls the creature’s specific weaknesses and natural defenses or
immunities. At the DM’s discretion, a failed ability check (in either of these
cases) will reveal misleading or even completely erroneous information which may
actually strengthen or otherwise benefit the undead</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="1">.
