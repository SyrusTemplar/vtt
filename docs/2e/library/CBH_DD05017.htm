Bards have many comrades throughout their lives. As they climb the ranks of
fame toward a great reputation, they rely heavily upon the various bard colleges.
These institutions contain fellow performers great and small. Bards meet those
who serve as teachers, critics, peers, and friends within the bard colleges.

A bard who proves to be a good entertainer gains a pool of patrons who go out
of their way to attend his performances and occasionally help him out. If a
bard survives long enough, he eventually gains devoted followers.
