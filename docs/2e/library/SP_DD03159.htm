<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Equipment</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Every adventurer wants to outfit himself with the best equipment-and plenty
of it. The delicate balance of equipment versus encumbrance is a routine
problem for any character. So, too, is the matter of finding those items the
character desires, and coming up with the money (or other barter) needed to acquire
them.
<P></P>
This chapter presents new ways that characters can earn money, and some
simple, accurate options for recording the amount of equipment carried-both as bulk
and weight. Equipment is discussed in terms of campaign environments, with
different tables ranging from the primitive to periods of the late Renaissance.

earn, maintain, and spend their treasure.
<P></P>
A player can exchange his character's money for character points when that
character is first created (after initial funds are determined, of course), and
then a maximum of once per level, including first level, throughout that
character's career. This opportunity is not cumulative-if a player makes no money/point
exchange before his character reaches second level, he can still only make one
such exchange before the character becomes third level. Within the bounds of
this restriction, however, a player can make such an exchange whenever he
wants-he doesn-t need to wait until the moment of level advancement.
<P></P>
The procedure for making this exchange is always the same: The player
determines how much total wealth the character has, as defined in Character Wealth,
Treasure, and Money, below. He can only make the exchange if the total is at least
30 gp, except that a character can always make the exchange with his initial
funds.
<P></P>
This total wealth is divided by three. One character point costs one third of
the character's wealth, and he can buy a maximum of three points by spending
all of the character's money. The deductions occur immediately, though the
character does not get to spend or give away his lost wealth. The DM will decide the
exact campaign situation. Coins and gems are stolen, for example, while
livestock falls to disease, trade goods rot, ships sink, etc.
<P></P>
Character points, as a general rule, cannot be expended for money or items of
equipment. However, the DM can make an exception during character creation. If
a player wishes to start out with an unusual amount of wealth, he can cash in a
single character point for an extra roll on the Initial Character Funds Table

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character's financial worth can be counted in many ways-only two of which
are relevant in making a trade for character points as described above.
<P></P>
The most obvious, of course, remains the metal coins, precious baubles, and
ornamented jewelry that have been standards of wealth for millennia. In game
terms, this treasure is represented by a value measured in gold pieces.
<P></P>
Secondly, wealth can be measured in personal possessions (including weapons,
armor, and magical items), all manner of trade goods, livestock and beasts of
burden, wagons, tack and harness, boats and ships.
<P></P>
The total of these two categories equals the character's wealth for purposes
of the money-for-points trade explained above. When making this total, however,
the character is allowed to hold one weapon and one other possession (armor,
magical item, horse, etc.) out of the equation.
<P></P>
The DM should insure that players are straightforward about their wealth when
making such an exchange. There are several forms of wealth discussed below
which are not relevant for purposes of the money/character point trade. However, a
player who converts most of his assets into another form (purchasing an estate
for 10,000 gp, for example, in the process spending everything but his last 60
gp) should not be allowed to immediately trade 20 gp increments for character
points. In this case, the land and holdings should count toward the total, and
immediately suffer a 1/3 devaluation of their worth. Flooding, earthquakes,
tornadoes, or locusts are a few suggested DM tools for accomplishing this price
decrease.
