This is by far the commonest style of leadership; the single leader. His style
of leadership may vary considerably, of course. He may be a stern, harsh
despot, ruling by force and fear. He can also be a kindly despot, a firm but wise
ruler. He might also be a weak, querulous, but kindly leaderâ€”rather ineffectual,
having lost his old strength and daring, but still smart enough to eliminate
young pretenders to his rulership when he sees them preparing a bid for power.
Styles of leadership will be looked at right after this section.
