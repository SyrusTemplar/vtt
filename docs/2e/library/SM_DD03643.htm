<FONT SIZE="3">The renowned fire wizard Daltim developed this spell
some years ago to protect important items or structures against the
various incendiary spells with which he was familiar. <I>Proofing</I>
renders an inanimate object nearly impervious to fire, granting the
affected item a +3 bonus to saving throws vs. magical fire (including
a dragon&#146;s breath), and a +6 bonus to saving throws vs. normal
fire. This is cumulative with the saving throw bonus of a magical
item, so a <I>cloak of protection +4 </I>could have a bonus of +7 to
+10 on any item saving throws versus combustion effects. Remember
that an item fails its saving throw on a natural roll of 1,
regardless of any bonuses.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The item affected must be one discrete construction or
object, although it can be articulated or composed of several parts
(for example, a suit of armor, a catapult, a house, or a carriage).
At 9th level, the wizard can proof an article of clothing or a small
piece of furniture; at 12th level, a small vehicle or large piece of
furniture; at 15th level, a small building or large vehicle; at 18th
level, a medium building or a very large vehicle; and at 20th level
or higher, a large building or small fortification. A character
dressed in a completely proofed article of clothing (a large cloak)
gains a +2 bonus to saving throws vs. fire.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The material component for <I>proofing versus
combustion </I>is a fire-brick made with the ashes left from a
phoenix&#146;s fire. Seafaring wizards often use this spell to
protect their vessels from hostile <I>fireballs </I>and various
fire-throwing devices.</FONT></P>
