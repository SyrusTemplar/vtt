Upon casting this spell, the wizard releases a powerful stroke of electrical
energy that inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the spellcaster (maximum
damage per level of 10d6) to each creature within its area of effect. A
successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half (round fractions down).
The bolt begins at a range and height decided by the caster and streaks outward
in a direct line from the casting wizard (for example, if a 40-foot bolt was
started at 180 feet from the wizard, the far end of the bolt would reach 220
feet (180 + 40). The lightning bolt may set fire to combustibles, sunder wooden
doors, splinter up to a half-foot thickness of stone, and melt metals with a low
melting point (lead, gold, copper, silver, bronze). Saving throws must be
rolled for objects that withstand the full force of a stroke (see the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01903.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01903.htm.php.html">fireball</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> spell). If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks
through it (i.e., the saving throw fails), the bolt continues. A bolt can breach 1
inch of wood or half an inch of stone per caster level, up to a maximum of 1
foot of wood or half a foot of stone.
<P></P>
The lightning bolt's area of effect is chosen by the spellcaster: either a
forked bolt 10 feet wide and 40 feet long or a single bolt 5 feet wide and 80 feet
long. If a bolt cannot reach its full length, because of an unyielding barrier
(such as a stone wall), the lightning bolt rebounds from the barrier toward
its caster, ending only when it reaches its full length.
<P></P>
For example: An 80-foot-long stroke is begun at a range of 40 feet, but it
hits a stone wall at 50 feet. The bolt travels 10 feet, hits the wall, and
rebounds for 70 feet back toward its creator (who is only 50 feet from the wall, and
so is caught in his own lightning bolt!).
<P></P>
The DM might allow reflecting bolts. When this type of lightning bolt strikes
a solid surface, the bolt reflects from the surface at an angle equal to the
angle of incidence (like light off a mirror). A creature crossed more than once
by the bolt must roll a saving throw for every time it is crossed, but it still
suffers either full damage (if one saving throw is missed) or half damage (if
all saving throws are made).
<P></P>
The material components of the spell are a bit of fur and an amber, crystal,
or glass rod.
