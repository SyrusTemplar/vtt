For each faith you establish in your campaign world, you have to decide what
it is that's being worshipped and venerated: A God, a Force, or a Philosophy.
<P></P>
A <B>God</B> is a powerful being, usually of human or greater intelligence, usually
desiring to impose its will or characteristics upon the world. A god is often devoted
to a single attribute or set of attributes (e.g., warfare, love, agriculture,
marriage, etc.) and so most of his interactions with the world will deal with
the god's promotion of that attribute among humankind. Gods do not have to be
anthropomorphic (i.e., manlike in form or personality characteristics), and so
one faith's god is often another faith's monster. However, most of the gods
worshipped by player-characters are likely to be anthropomorphic and not monstrous.
<P></P>
A <B>Force</B> is some sort of natural (or unnatural) process which influences the world. It
isn't necessarily intelligent, but it is magically powerful . . . and humans
who accept the dictates and goals of this force can become its priests and use
spells based on that magical power. Some Forces which can be so worshipped
include Entropy, Nature, the Life-Death-Rebirth Cycle, and Magic. Druids tend to be
priests of the Force of Nature, instead of specific Gods of Nature. (There are
exceptions to that generalization, of course.)
<P></P>
A <B>Philosophy</B> is an idea, or set of ideas, which (in these magical worlds) is so compelling
that it attracts magical energy and faith to it, much as a Force does.
Philosophies are usually created by man or other sentient races, spread throughout
cultures, and gain such widespread acceptance and belief that they do become much
like Forces. When no one believes in a Philosophy any longer, it can generate
no magical power and support no priests, so the priests' duty is to embody its
attributes and to teach the philosophy so that it will never die. Sample
philosophies include Oneness With Nature, Peace, the Divinity of Mankind, the Sanctity
of Life, Nihilism, and so on.
<P></P>
In the AD&amp;D? game, the God, Force, and Philosophy are identical in the way
they are treated by the game mechanics. All three provide spells and powers to
their priests. All three demand personal requirements and services of their
priests and of their non-priest followers. And all three, to a lesser or greater
degree, shape the world, both through their own powers and through their agents,
the priests.
