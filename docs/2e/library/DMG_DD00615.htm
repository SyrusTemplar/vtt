Light sources, particularly fires, tend either to attract or chase away
creatures. Wild animals tend to avoid lights and fires, especially if hunters
frequent the area. On the other hand, animals that hunt player characters (or horse
meat) will be attracted to a fire. They have learned that fires signal a source
of food.
<P></P>
Intelligent creatures always approach a light source with caution. Friendly
NPCs don't know if they are approaching the camp of a friend or foe. Hostile NPCs
will likewise get as close as they can without revealing themselves, in order
to learn the strength and numbers of the enemy. Only a few NPCs?those wishing
to avoid all danger?flee at the sight of a fire, generally heading away from it
in the opposite direction.
