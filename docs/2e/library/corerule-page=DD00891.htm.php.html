<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Boots of the North:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This footgear bestows many powers upon the wearer. First, he is able to travel
across snow at normal rate of movement, leaving no tracks. The boots also
enable the wearer to travel at half normal movement rate across the most slippery
ice (horizontal surfaces only, not vertical or sharply slanted ones) without
falling or slipping. <I>Boots of the north</I> warm the wearer, so that even in a temperature as low as -50 degrees F., he
is comfortable with only scant clothingâ€”a loin of cloth and cloak, for instance.
If the wearer of the boots is fully dressed in cold-weather clothing, he can
withstand temperatures as low as -100 degrees F.
