<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Impersonation:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This trait represents the acting talent in the modern world—the character has
a natural ability to fall into a role, and to project that role believably to
others. A character with the impersonation trait gains a +2 bonus to all rolls
made using the disguise proficiency.
<P></P>
Additionally, the character can assume a disguise immediately—i.e., without
benefit of costume or makeup. Such an impromptu disguise cannot alter the
character to assume a specific identity, nor can it alter the appearance of his race
or, except under unusual circumstances, sex.
