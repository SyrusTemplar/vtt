<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Chime of Interruption:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This magical instrument can be struck once per turn. Its resonant tone lasts
for three full rounds. While the chime is resonating, no spell requiring a
verbal component can be cast within a 30-foot radius of it unless the caster is able
to make a saving throw vs. breath weapon. After its effects fade, the chime
must be rested for at least seven rounds. If it is struck again before this time
elapses, no sound issues forth, and a full turn must elapse from that point in
time before it can again be sounded.
