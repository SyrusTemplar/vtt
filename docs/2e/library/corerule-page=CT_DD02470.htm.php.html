</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Even the greenest recruits have more options in combat than to stand in one
place and swing at opponents over and over again. This chapter covers tactics,
options, and styles of fighting that are available to anyone on a battlefield.
Battles aren’t just a matter of who gets the lucky rolls now; smart characters
can make their own luck by using sound tactics and common sense in the thick of
the fight.
<P></P>
There are five parts to this chapter. The first is <I>Battle Tactics</I>; it covers common tactics for fighting a battle, including <I>shield walls, pike hedges, </I>and <I>mounted charges. Attack Options </I>discusses different ways to use a character’s attack to achieve specific
results. <I>Fighting Styles, Dueling, </I>and <I>Heroic Frays </I>discuss the various tactics of personal combat and how characters can employ
them to their advantage.
