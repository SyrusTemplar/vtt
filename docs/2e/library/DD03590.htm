Spells or effects that generate powerful gusts of wind can create a number of
collateral effects. Enchantments such as <I>dust devil, gust of wind, wind wall, </I>and <I>control wind </I>are the most common in this group, and monsters such as djinni or aerial
servants can create whirlwinds.

dusty or sandy surface is a different story altogether. On a dry, gritty
surface, a wind-based spell or attack will create a rolling dust cloud that creates
a –2 penalty for people trying to fight or fire missiles into or through the
area of effect.

A blast of wind can also make it very difficult to hear anything above the
roaring of the air and may carry a character’s scent downwind and away from a
creature that relies on smell or hearing to locate its enemies.

torches and candles and plunging the party into darkness. Above the ground, it can
carry the sparks from a campfire farther than normal or blow over a lamp,
possibly starting an unexpected fire.
