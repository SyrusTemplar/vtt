These horrors, sometimes called <I>tlincallis,</I> are part human and part scorpion. A manscorpion has a dark-skinned human
torso, its abdomen is protected by bony plates, and its ribs and backbone protrude
from the body. Their hands have two thick fingers and a long thumb; the hands
are often mistaken for scorpion-like claws. The creatures are hairless, and
their faces are handsome and noble, except for the red, glowing eyes which have no
pupils.
<P></P>
The creature's torso sits atop a 4-foot-long, bony-plated, arachnoid body
which is supported by six legs. Bony plate completely covers the strong legs. The
protruding spine continues along the abdomen and forms a tail 10 feet long. The
lower body, legs, and tail are usually sand-colored, and blend easily with the
desert. Observers rarely see anything but the muscular human torso until the
manscorpions are close.
<P></P>
The origins of these creatures is thought to lie in an ancient curse placed on
evil humans. They speak their own language, and 20% also speak some locally
spoken tongue.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Most manscorpions have low to average intelligence; they patrol their
territory in squads of six warriors. A squad leader and a spellcaster, each with 9 HD
and greater intelligence, are also present. The spellcaster has the abilities of
a 4th-level cleric or mage. Fully 50% of them carry obsidian-studded clubs
(treat as a battle axe) and bolas or javelins. The rest use only their natural
weapons.
<P></P>
When directed by the squad leader, manscorpions attack in an organized manner.
They use long-range attacks before closing for melee. In close combat, they
attack with weapon, claw, and tail, or with tail and two claws. The tail can
strike anywhere nearby, including in front of the creature. When not being used for
attack, the tail sweeps the area behind the manscorpion, checking for
obstacles and assailants. Anyone struck by the tail's spur must make a successful
saving throw vs. poison or die in 2d4 rounds. Victims suffer weakness for one round
(-2 attack penalty), start to shake in the next round (-3 attack penalty and no
Dexterity bonus to AC), then convulse (AC 10 and no attacks possible) until
they die.
<P></P>
Common manscorpions lose organization and their morale is reduced without a
leader. When morale is reduced to 1 or 2 hit points, common manscorpions go into
a stinging frenzy, making two tail attacks per round, but no other attacks.
<P></P>
Patrols are more common near the manscorpion lair, which is guarded by a swarm
consisting of three squads. A swarm leader and a spellcaster, each with 10 Hit
Dice, accompany a swarm. The spellcaster is the equivalent of a 7th-level
priest or wizard. These leaders stay out of combat, directing the action and
casting spells. Swarms are sent on patrol in times of trouble.
<P></P>
For every two swarms, there is a noble and a sorcerer. They stay near the lair
unless an army of manscorpions is marching, then they will lead two swarms.
These leaders have 11 HD, and sorcerers cast spells at 9th-level ability.
<P></P>
Finally, every lair has a king or queen, or both, with 12 Hit Dice. A high
cleric, also with 12 HD, aids these rulers with the abilities of an 11th-level
priest. They always remain in the lair and will only fight if directly threatened.
<P></P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Manscorpions live under the desert sands in burrows connected by tunnels, all
situated above underground cities of 40-400 individuals. These often mirror
great human cities, with pits instead of buildings, and great chasms like inverted
pyramids.
<P></P>
Manscorpions often hold humans and dwarves as slaves, using them to mine and
create weaponry. A manscorpion's fingers are not very dexterous, but they are
fine sculptors with hammer and chisel, and many sculptures decorate their cities.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Manscorpions eat practically any meat, including carrion. No normal creatures
prey on them.
