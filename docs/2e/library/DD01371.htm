function as a sage (see <A HREF="DMG_DD00575.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00575.htm">Dungeon Master Guide</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, Chapter 12). The wizard can answer general questions in two categories
listed on table 61 in the <A HREF="DMG_DD00576.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00576.htm">Dungeon Master Guide</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, but one category must be Alchemy or Chemistry. This reflects the character’s
knowledge of magical potions and scroll inks. The player can choose the
remaining category or the DM can assign one.
<P></P>
The character’s base chance to answer a general question is 6 or less on 1d20,
modified by the character’s Intelligence/Knowledge bonus.
<P></P>
At 24th level, the character can answer specific questions after acquiring 1d6
books or scrolls at a cost of 1,000 gp each.
<P></P>
At 27th level, the character can answer exacting questions after acquiring 1d6
additional books or scrolls at a cost of 1,000 gp each.
<P></P>
It is always possible for a character to discover the answer to a difficult
question by consulting another character, undertaking an adventure the DM has
devised, or by engaging in very lengthy and expensive research. See the magical
item creation rules in <A HREF="DD01281.htm#41c093d5"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01281.htm#41c093d5">Chapter 4</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> of this book and the spell research rules in Chapter 7 of the <A HREF="DMG_DD00353.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00353.htm">Dungeon Master Guide</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I> </I>for guidelines.
<P></P>
For example, a high-level wizard with a knowledge of history might discover
the answer to a fairly simple, but specific, question (What was the name of King
Rassmon’s oldest daughter?) after 1d3+1 weeks of study at a cost of 100 gp a
week. This is the same as the cost to discover a potion formula. A very difficult
and esoteric question (Who made the carpet that lay in king Rassmon’s great
hall?) might require as much time and money to research as a 6th- or 7th-level
spell. The chance to know the answer would be the same as that for successfully
researching the spell.
