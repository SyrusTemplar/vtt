Archers on horseback are very effective against foot troops without missile
weapons. (If the character on foot has a weapon to reply to the horse archer?s
fire, it?s a different story.) Weapons suitable for use while mounted include
short bows, composite short bows, hand crossbows, light crossbows, and size S
firearms.

If the archer remains still (takes a no-move action), his rate of fire and
range modifiers are unaffected by his mount. If he rides a half-move, his rate of
fire is reduced by one category and he suffers a ?2 penalty to his attack
rolls. If his mount takes a full move, his rate of fire is reduced as above, and he
suffers a ?4 penalty to his attack rolls. These penalties can be reduced by
expertise in mounted archery; refer to <A HREF="DD02651.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02651.htm">Chapter Four</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> for more information.

The best way to exploit the archer?s mobility is to gallop in for a round of
fire and then retreat when the foot troops try to respond. This tactical system
was one of the most successful ever devised, and for a time rendered infantry
nearly obsolete.
