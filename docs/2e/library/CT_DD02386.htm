<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Combat Status </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Any figure involved in combat falls into one of three categories: <I>clear, threatened, </I>or <I>grappled</I>. This represents the immediacy of an enemy threat and influences what actions
the character can choose for that combat round. A character?s options are
extremely limited when he is caught in an owlbear?s hug.
<P></P>
In addition to governing the character?s choice of combat actions for the
round, threatening is also important because it determines who is subject to what
are known as <I>attacks of opportunity </I>(<A HREF="DD02391.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02391.htm">see below</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">).
