<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The following information supplements the
proficiency descriptions given in </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01541.htm.php.html">Chapter
5</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> of the <I>PH</I>. Whenever a
proficiency bonus is indicated, the bonus is added to the normal
check modifier. For example, when a paladin receives a +2 bonus for
using the animal training proficiency to train his bonded mount, the
modifier is increased from the normal 0 to +2.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Animal Handling:</B> As explained in
Chapter 2, a paladin can soothe his bonded mount automatically; the
Animal Handling proficiency isn't necessary. The proficiency may be
used normally to calm other animals of the same species as the bonded
mount, as well as other pack animals and beasts of burden.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Animal Lore:</B> Although this
proficiency allows a character to imitate animal sounds, this ability
neither helps nor hinders the paladin when summoning his bonded mount.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Animal Training:</B> A paladin doesn't
need the Animal Training proficiency to teach tricks and tasks to his
bonded mount. However, if he has this proficiency in the same species
as the bonded mount, he earns a +2 bonus to his checks when training
the bonded mount. The bonus applies to the bonded mount only, not to
other animals of the same species. Should the paladin acquire a
different bonded mount, he earns the bonus only if he has the Animal
Training proficiency in the same species as the new mount.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Armorer:</B> This proficiency also
allows characters to construct barding for mounts, presuming the
availability of materials and facilities. Table 24 gives the time
required to make barding for war horses, and mounts of comparable
size. For smaller or larger mounts, the DM should adjust the times
accordingly. Elephant barding might require an extra week or two;
barding for a small mule might take a week less. Subtract two weeks
for all types of half barding.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; As with character armor, barding may be
flawed. After creating the barding, the DM secretly makes a
proficiency check. If the check fails but is within 4 of a successful
result, the character believes the armor is normal, until in combat
it functions as 1 AC worse (flawed chain barding has an effective AC
of 5). Flawed armor breaks on a natural roll of 19 or 20 in melee
combat; the animal's AC then worsens by 4, though it can't be reduced
below AC 10 (if flawed leather barding breaks, it has an effective AC
of 9). As long as a mount wears broken armor, its movement rate is
halved, and it suffers a &#150;4 penalty to its attack rolls. A
character can remove broken armor from a mount in 2-8 (2d4) rounds.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Because barding must be fitted exactly, a
set of barding styled for one mount won't work for any other animal,
even of the same species.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Brewing: </B>A paladin whose ethos
forbids partaking of strong drink isn't likely to have this
proficiency. A paladin with a more liberal ethos may use this
proficiency to prepare drinks for others, even if he declines to
partake himself.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fishing:</B> A paladin whose ethos
demands reverence for life in all forms should refrain from fishing
for recreation. However, he may still fish for food.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Healing:</B> A paladin's ability to
heal by laying on hands (see </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD05381.htm.php.html">Chapter
2</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) operates independently of this
proficiency. A paladin with the Healing proficiency may use it
instead of or in addition to laying hands on a damaged character. For
example, a 2nd-level paladin with the healing proficiency could lay
on hands to heal 4 points of damage, then use his healing proficiency
to heal an additional 1d3 points.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Hunting:</B> A paladin whose ethos
restricts any type of unnecessary killing will refuse to hunt merely
for sport. Unless he has religious or cultural objections to eating
meat, he hunts for food. Further, he stalks and kills dangerous
animals that pose a threat to himself, his companions, or other
innocent people.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Gaming:</B> A paladin whose ethos
includes moral objections to gambling will not engage in games of
chance. Using this proficiency to cheat is a serious ethos violation.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Riding, Airborne and Land-based:</B>
When riding his bonded mount, a paladin automatically has all of the
benefits of the relevant Riding proficiency; he doesn't need the
proficiency itself (see Chapter 3). But if he <I>has</I> the Riding
proficiency, he gains a +2 bonus when making all associated checks
with his mount. For instance, if he has a war horse bonded mount and
the Land-based Riding proficiency, he earns a +2 bonus when
attempting to vault into the saddle when the mount is moving. If he
has a pegasus bonded mount and the Airborne Riding proficiency, he
suffers a &#150;2 penalty (instead of &#150;4) when making checks to
see if he falls from his saddle after suffering damage. The bonuses
apply only when riding the bonded mount. When riding a creature of
the same species as the bonded mount, use the normal Riding
proficiency rules.</FONT></P>
