The aarakocra are a race of intelligent bird-men that live on the peaks of the
highest mountains, spending their days soaring on the thermal winds in peace
and solitude.
<P></P>
Aarakocra are about 5 feet tall and have a wing span of 20 feet. About halfway
along the edge of each wing is a hand with three human-sized fingers and an
opposable thumb. An elongated fourth finger extends the length of the wing and
locks in place for flying. Though the wing-hands cannot grasp during flight, they
are nearly as useful as human hands when an aarakocra is on the ground and its
wings are folded back. The wing muscles anchor in a bony chest plate that
provides the aarakocra with extra protection. The powerful legs end in four sharp
talons that can unlock and fold back to reveal another pair of functional hands,
also with three human-sized fingers and an opposable thumb. The hand bones,
like the rest of an aarakocra's skeleton, are hollow and fragile.
<P></P>
Aarakocra faces resemble crosses between parrots and eagles. They have
gray-black beaks, and black eyes set frontally in their heads that provide keen
binocular vision. Plumage color varies from tribe to tribe, but generally males are
red, orange, and yellow while females are brown and gray.
<P></P>
Aarakocra speak their own language, the language of giant eagles, and, on
occasion, the common tongue (10% chance).
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> In aerial combat, an aarakocra fights with either talons or the heavy
fletched javelins that he clutches in his lower hands. An aarakocra typically carries
a half dozen javelins strapped to his chest in individual sheaths. The
javelins, which can be used for throwing or stabbing, inflict 2d4 points of damage.
Owing to the aarakocra's remarkable skill at throwing javelins in the air, it
incurs none of the attack penalties for aerial missile fire. An aarakocra will
always save its last javelin for stabbing purposes rather than throwing it. Its
favorite attack is to dive at a victim while clutching a javelin in each hand,
then pull out of the dive just as it reaches its target, and strike with a
blood-curdling shriek. This attack gains a +4 bonus to the attack roll and causes
double damage, but an aarakocra must dive at least 200 feet to execute it properly.
<P></P>
An aarakocra is reluctant to engage in grappling or ground combat, since its
fragile bones are easily broken. Though rarely used except when cornered, an
aarakocra's sharp beak can bite for 1-3 points of damage.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Aarakocra live in small tribes of about 11-30 (1d20+10) members. Each tribe
has a hunting territory of about 10,000 square miles with colorful banners and
pennants marking the boundaries.
<P></P>
Each tribe lives in a communal nest made of woven vines with a soft lining of
dried grass. The eldest male serves as the tribe's leader. In tribes of more
than 20 members, the second oldest male serves as the shaman, leading simple
religious ceremonies involving the whistling of melodic hymns at sunset on the
first day of a new month. Males spend most of their waking hours hunting for food
and occasionally for treasure, such as gems and other shiny objects. Females
spend eight months of the year incubating their eggs, passing the time by
fabricating javelins and other tools from wood and stone. While resting on their backs,
aarakocra females can use all four hands at the same time to weave boundary
pennants, javelins sheaths, and other useful objects from vines and feathers.
<P></P>
Five aarakocra, including a shaman, can summon an <A HREF="DD03876.htm#5e0445e4"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03876.htm#5e0445e4">air elemental</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> by chanting and performing an intricate aerial dance for three melee rounds.
The summoned air elemental will comply with the aarakocras' request for a
favor, though it will not endanger its life on their behalf.
<P></P>
Aarakocra are extremely claustrophobic and will not willingly enter a cave,
building, or other enclosed area.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Aarakocra have little to do with other species, including neighboring
aarakocra tribes, and leave their home territory only in extreme circumstances. They
rarely encounter humans except for an occasional foray into a rural community to
snatch a stray farm animal; this is not an intentionally malicious act, as
aarakocra are unable to distinguish between domestic and wild animals. A human
venturing into aarakocra territory may be able to convince one to serve as a guide
or a scout in exchange for a shiny jewel or coin.
