<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Now that you have your bard fully defined, it is time
to put on a show. Bards perform in every situation, from street shows
to elaborate performances in the town's grand theater. This section
contains the information you and your Dungeon Master need to
determine the cost, turnout, and income from such performances.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">In several places in this section, a proficiency check
is asked for without the exact proficiency being specified. The
actual proficiency depends upon the type of performance. If the bard
is playing an instrument, use the musical instrument proficiency; if
he is juggling knives, use the juggling proficiency; and if he is
singing, use the singing proficiency. Thus, the proficiency check
matches the performance being given.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Street-side Performances</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Street-side performances include any situation in
which the bard plays for a changing audience in a public place. Bards
can try playing on the sides of streets, in front of public
buildings, in the town bazaar, <I>etc</I>.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">All a bard needs to perform street-side is a coin
collection device (a box, cup, or open knapsack), his performing
implements, and some time.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">In some towns and villages, the law considers
street-side performers to be beggars and vagrants. In such towns a
permit containing a wax seal set with the appropriate official's ring
must be carried or the performer is likely to end up paying twice the
amount he made and possibly spending a night in the town dungeon. The
typical fee for such a document is 1 gp. The document is good as long
as it lasts (which is usually 1d8 days, due to the fragile nature of
the wax).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The big danger or thrill (depending upon point of
view) of performing street side lies in the performer's exposure.
Thieves consider street-side performers to be easy pickings; even
beggars have been known to loot a bard's takings. On occasion a gang
of ruffians will attack the performer in an attempt to gain his
valuables (instruments are well worth such a risk).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Performing street side for money is considered a
desperate act; a bard with a reputation of 10 or above loses two
places on the ladder during any week in which he gives such a performance.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The income gained from a street-side performance is
figured by rolling both a proficiency check and a reputation check.
The number of successful rolls (0 {both fail}, 1, or 2 {both
succeed}) is checked against the conditions, as determined by the
Dungeon Master, on </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD05010.htm.php.html">Table
29</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. The bard's total income from
the performance is determined by multiplying the hourly income (found
in Table 29) by the number of hours the bard performs that day. New
checks are needed for each day's performance.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Booked Performances</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">A booking is an arrangement in which a bard entertains
the crowd of some private business (usually a tavern). The tavern
master and bard come to some prearranged agreement as to the income,
hours, and type of entertainment. The bard (and his assistants if
any) simply show up and perform. The tavern master always has a place
set aside for the performer. Perhaps a small stage, a corner of the
tavern floor, or even some old keyboard instrument.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Typically, it is the bard's responsibility to bring
all the instruments required for his performance. Other than that,
the bard has no set expenses. Drinks are usually on the house as long
as the bard doesn't select the more expensive items. However, it is
considered professional to tip the bar maids and wenches heavily when
they bring a performer drinks (it sets a good example for the customers).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Few cities have any legal limitations on booked performances.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Although a booked performer is a bit more protected
from snatch-and-run thieves, the danger from bar fights and brawls is
almost as bad. It is unlikely that the bard will lose money in such
situations, but his body and instruments can be severely damaged.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Bookings are considered a good starting place for
bards. Such performances satisfy the requirement for a bard to
perform locally in a town in order to maintain his reputation.
However, highly reputable bards (13 or higher) suffer a -1 reputation
adjustment for giving a booked performance in any but the most lavish surroundings.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The method of payment varies widely from tavern to
tavern and from low to high social level. The tendency is for the
tavern master to pay the bard a set salary once a night, week, or
month. On top of this, wise tavern masters also allow bards to put
out a collection bowl. This ensures that the bard gives his all
during the performance.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Collection bowls gain money at the street-side
performance rate specified on Table 29. The salaried income should be
determined randomly on Table 30. The bard can then adjust this random
result by one in any direction if he rolls a successful reputation
check or a proficiency check, or by two if he succeeds with both checks.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Carnivals</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The term carnival is used here to include any circus,
carnival, caravan, or other traveling form of entertainment. All of
these groups arrive at most towns from time to time. During the local
harvest season, circuses often arrive to join in the celebration and
festivities. Holidays are often targeted by carnival bands.
Occasionally the governing body of a large city actually contracts
for a carnival as part of a fund raising drive.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Carnival bands are complex and expensive operations to
run, and they include multiple performers. It is easiest for a bard
to join in an existing carnival, but if he wants to start his own he
has to invest some time and money. The base list of needed assets
includes at least one wagon (though a one-wagon carnival is unlikely
to see much success), horses or oxen to pull it, entertaining
implements, portable performance area (a stage, tents, <I>etc</I>.),
several high-quality performers, and the necessary support crew
(teamster, cook, carpenter, <I>etc</I>.). Total outlay of gold for
such an operation is in the thousands of gold pieces.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">It is illegal in most towns and villages for a
carnival to simply set up tents and begin performing (unless it is
well outside of the town walls). Legal permission ranges from simple
verbal approval to purchasing a carnival or circus permit from the
town. Such permits typically cost 50 gold per tent, stage, or
performing area and are generally good for one week.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The dangers a carnival faces are much the same as
those faced by a traveling merchant: highway robbery, pirates (during
water transport), and monster raids are common. Even within the walls
of a town, a carnival is far from safe. Thieves and beggars are
attracted to carnivals like flies. Although these lowlifes typically
play the crowd, they aren't against making off with a valuable
instrument or the carnival strong box. Even more dangerous are the
rival carnivals and performers who are in competition for the same
audience. Such groups occasionally resort to practical jokes,
vandalism, employing bullies, or even hiring assassins to drive off
the competition.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Performing in a carnival is considered quite reputable
and satisfies the performance criteria of reputation up to and
including a reputation of 17. If a more reputable bard performs for
any but the most elite carnivals, he will suffer a -1 adjustment to
his local reputation.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Carnival performers are given free room and board
while on the road (typically some blankets and a mat to throw in,
under, or around the wagon or tents at night and relatively good food
from the traveling cook). On top of this, they make wages. The normal
arrangement is that each performing night's income is divided up as
follows: 50% to the carnival master and 50% to the crew. The crew's
half of the money is not split evenly. Each member is assigned a
number of shares. Typical shares are as follows:</FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The night's total income is equal to the total number
of attendees (attendees plus patrons) times the carnival fee.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Each performer draws in a number of attendees based
upon a reputation and proficiency check. (These attendees are in
addition to applicable patrons--see page 117 for more about patrons.)
The number drawn by each performer should be checked separately (for
simplicity, DMs may use the &quot;1&quot; column on Table 32 for all
NPC performers). Roll both a proficiency check and a reputation
check, then consult the following table to determine how many
attendees that performer drew into the carnival. Note that this
doesn't mean that this is the number that the performer entertains,
as attendees drawn in by other performers wander around and observe
all the acts.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The typical fee for a night at the carnival is one
electrum piece per person (except infants, who are admitted for
free). If this carnival's entrance fee is higher or lower, the
Dungeon Master will take this into account when he determines the
nightly conditions for the purposes of Table 32 (higher fees
effectively improve the conditions, lower fees worsen the conditions).</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Shows and Productions</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Shows and productions are the big time for performers.
These include any performance that takes place in an established
building or place where the audience shows up specifically for the
performance and nothing else. Some examples include plays and
recitals given at the local theater or opera house, concerts at the
local music hall, and productions put on at local bard colleges. Such
a performance is either a regularly scheduled event or is accompanied
by a lot of promotion and advertising.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The cost of putting on a show or production is large.
Costs include advertising, facility rental, stage hands, performer's
fees, <I>etc</I>. A typical outlay is 1d4 silver pieces times the
maximum possible crowd (this is usually equal to the available seating).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Shows and performances are usually outside the domain
of city laws. Even if there are fees, the owner of the facility is
generally responsible for payment (typically an additional silver
piece per audience member).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">A nice side benefit to such extravagant performances
is the unlikely event of victimization. The only crooks who dare mess
with such events are high-ranking master thieves or a fully planned
hit by the local thieves' guild, though these are very rare occurrences.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">It is considered an honor to perform in shows or
productions. This satisfies performance requirements for any
reputation level and actually boosts reputations of 10 or less by +1.
However, it is rare for any performer below a 10 reputation to be
invited to perform at such events. The standard auditions eliminate
all but the best performers.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Of all performances, productions provide the greatest
for potential income, but they are also the most risky. As with
carnivals, the net nightly income is equal to the number of attendees
times the admittance fee. Typical admittance fees to productions are
1 gold piece, although really elaborate performances put on in
extravagant theaters can range up to a platinum piece or more.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Before the actual number of attendees is determined,
the maximum possible number must be found. If the performance is to
take place within a building, the maximum equals the building's
seating capacity. Otherwise, some reasonable number will have to be
settled upon between Dungeon Master and the involved players.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Once the maximum possible crowd is determined, each
performer rolls both a reputation check and a proficiency check. Take
the total number of successful checks from all performers and divide
this by the number of checks that were rolled. This gives a number
between 0 and 1, inclusive. Multiply this number by the maximum
possible crowd to determine how many people actually show up.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">If every performer succeeds at both checks, then the
maximum possible crowd shows up. If only half of the checks succeed,
then the number of attendees is only half the maximum. If 25%
succeed, then 25% show up, etc. On top of this, bards have their
applicable patrons show up.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Half of the net income (attendance fees minus
production costs) goes to the facility's owner and the other half is
divided among the performers and stage hands using the carnival's
share system.</FONT></P>
