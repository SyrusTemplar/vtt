Swashbuckler weapons are light, fast weapons used by lightly-armored
opponents, usually in an environment (a culture, nation or even just a city) where
heavier arms and armor are illegal or outdated. They're also appropriate for
shipboard campaigns and situations; the light armor is easier to get out of so you
don't drown if you fall overboard. So, usually, swashbucklers emerge in an area
where the days of the plate-armored, broadsword-wielding knight are past . . . or
at least numbered. Swashbuckler characters might bolt on the plate mail and
pick up the lance for genuine warfare, but in their cosmopolitan big-city
adventures they stick to the lighter stuff . . . and can be sure that most of the
opponents they face will be likewise armed and armored.
<P></P>
Weapons from the <I>Player's Handbook</I> which can be considered swashbuckler weapons include: Bows (all types),
Crossbows (all available types), Dagger/Dirk, Knife, Polearms (all types), and Short
Swords. The only sorts of shields they use regularly are bucklers and small
shields, and they tend to wear only leather, padded, and hide armor.
<P></P>
The new weapons listed on the chart above include:

<P></P>
The stiletto is a type of narrow-bladed knife, sharp only at the point. Its
most unusual trait is that it confers a +2 (non-magical) bonus to attack rolls
against certain armor types: Plate mail (bronze and normal), ring mail, and chain
mail. (This is because its narrow point and blade slip in more readily through
any sort of armor that is not solid metal or overlapping plates of metal.)
<P></P>
It otherwise behaves like any other knife, and Knife weapon proficiency is
exactly the same as Stiletto weapon proficiency: If you know one, you know the
other equally well, at no additional cost in proficiency slots.

<P></P>
The main-gauche is a large-bladed dagger with a basket hilt (see the
description of Cutlass, above) and large quillions. Though it is a stabbing weapon, it's
primarily a defensive weapon wielded in the left-hand in two-weapon technique
(or two-weapon style specialization).
<P></P>
When used by someone with Main-gauche weapon proficiency, the weapon confers a
+1 bonus to attack rolls with the Disarm and Parry maneuvers. Because of its
cutlass-like basket hilt, the main-gauche, too, works like an iron gauntlet if
the wielder wishes to punch someone with the hilt rather than slash with the
blade.
<P></P>
Main-gauche proficiency is related to, but not identical to, dagger
proficiency. Specialization confers the usual benefits.
<P></P>
<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
The rapier is a long-bladed, one-handed sword, normally sharp only at the
point. It's a thrusting weapon, wielded with lightning-like thrusts and lunges.
Swashbucklers often learn Two-Weapon Style Specialization and use rapier with
rapier, with main-gauche, with short sword, or with dagger, stiletto, or knife.
It's also occasionally used with buckler.
<P></P>
Rapier requires its own proficiency, which is related to sabre proficiencyâ€”not
long sword and its related weapons. Weapon specialization confers the usual
benefits.
<P></P>
You can have a rapier made with a basket hilt. This adds 2 gp to the cost, +1
lb. to the weight, and confers the normal basket-hilt benefits: +1 to attack
rolls with Parry maneuver, and the iron-gauntlet benefit for Punching.

<P></P>
The sabre is a light slashing weapon. Its practitioners commonly use only
sabre, and often take Single-Weapon Style Specialization<I> and</I> Sabre Weapon Specialization. They are very deadly with their blades and may
be inordinately proud of the facial scars they accumulate (and deal out).
<P></P>
Sabre requires its own proficiency, which is related to rapier proficiency.
<P></P>
Sabres, like cutlasses and main-gauches, are made with a basket hilt. This
confers the normal basket-hilt benefits: +1 to attack rolls with Parry maneuver,
and the iron-gauntlet benefit for Punching.
