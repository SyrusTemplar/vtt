</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Transmuter: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The most versatile of the specialist wizards is the transmuter, specializing
in the school of alteration. The school of alteration is the largest of the
schools of philosophy, giving the transmuter access to a variety of powers and
abilities. In order to master the complicated somatic gestures of this school, a
wizard must have a Dexterity (Dexterity/Aim) of 15 or higher to become a
transmuter. The school of alteration is opposed by the schools of necromancy and
abjuration.

Transmuters have the normal benefits and restrictions of specialist wizards.
In addition, they gain an additional +1 bonus to their saving throws versus
alteration spells and related magical effects (such as a <I>wand of polymorph</I>) when they reach 8th level, for a total of +2. At 11th level, this increases
to +3.

Transmuters command a number of useful spells. Their offensive and defensive
capabilities are quite formidable, and they also have access to spells such as <I>haste </I>or <I>strength</I> that can drastically enhance the whole party?s fighting power. Despite their
skill in battle, transmuters are at their best when overcoming obstacles; there
is a great range of generally useful alteration spells such as passwall and
fly which may make it possible for transmuters to avoid fights altogether.
