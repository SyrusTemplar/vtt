container commonly used in the campaign world. The character requires a wheel and a
kiln, as well as a supply of clay and glaze. The character can generally create
two small- or medium-sized items or one large-sized item per day. The pieces of
pottery must then be fired in the kiln for an additional day.

The raw materials involved cost 3 cp to make a small item, 5 cp to make a
medium-sized item, and 1 sp to make a large item.
