High masters who spend one more slot on learning their weapon of choice can
become <I>grand masters</I>. Grand masters are capable of feats of swordplay that border on the
fantastic. Grand masters gain one additional attack per round above and beyond a
specialist’s rate of attacks for their level, so a 12th-level melee weapon grand
master would attack 3 times per round with his weapon of choice.
<P></P>
Grand masters also increase the amount of damage and the chance of a knockdown
when they employ their chosen weapon. The weapon’s base damage die and
knockdown die are increased to the next greater die size against all opponents. A long
sword thus inflicts 1d10/1d20 points of damage in the hands of a grand master,
and its knockdown die is increased to a d10. If the weapon causes multiple
dice of damage, all of them are increased. Thus, a two-handed sword in the hands
of a grand master inflicts 3d8 points of damage on large targets. Needless to
say, grand masters are extremely dangerous opponents.
