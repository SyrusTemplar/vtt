<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Hourglass of Fire and Ice:</B> This small, wooden-framed hourglass looks quite ordinary, but radiates
invocation/evocation magic if detected. Half these hourglasses contain red sand and
half contain blue sand.
<P></P>
An hourglass containing red sand in the lower portion enables a spellcaster to
cast fire-based spells with increased potency: +1 per die of damage. Further,
victims suffer a -1 penalty to all saves against such spells, and even saving
throws against illusions of fire are made at -1.
<P></P>
When the hourglass is tilted, the red sand flows slowly through the aperture,
turning blue as it does so. The hourglass takes 6 turns to fill with blue sand.
When the hourglass has filled with blue sand, all cold-based spells cast by
the owner of the hourglass have +1 per die of damage. Victims also suffer a -1
penalty to saving throws against cold-based spells, including saves against
illusions of cold.
<P></P>
The hourglass may be inverted to re-create the red sand, with a corresponding
flip in the effects after 6 turns.
<P></P>
The hourglass may be inverted up to three times per day. However, with every
inversion of the hourglass there is a 1% chance that it will break, spilling its
sands and losing its magic forever.
