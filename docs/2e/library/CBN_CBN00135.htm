By means of this spell, a necromancer bestows a powerful curse on a person or
object which becomes a carrier for plague and contagion. Every person or animal
that comes in direct physical contact with the cursed carrier must make a
saving throw vs. death magic or contract a fatal disease (as described in the
3rd-level priest spell <I>cause disease</I> on pages 209?10 of the <I>PHB</I>), resulting in a victim?s slow, agonizing demise within 2?5 weeks. The living
focus of a plague curse is completely immune from the effects of the disease
he or she carries. In many cases, the carrier will be oblivious to his cursed
condition?especially if the carrier is a frequent traveler and does not remain in
a single location long enough for the plague symptoms to surface in those he
or she contacts.
<P></P>
The carrier of a <I>plague curse</I> displays no outward signs of disease and radiates only a very faint aura of
necromancy (only a 5% chance of detecting per level). The curse may only be
removed from an individual by a priest of higher level than the caster (<I>dispel magic</I> has no effect); alternatively, a cursed object may be cleansed by destruction
in fire.
<P></P>
Normally, the curse only expires after it has claimed one life for each level
of the original caster. As for the deadly affliction caused by a plague curse,
it may be successfully treated with a paladin?s healing touch or with such
spells as <I>cure disease, heal, </I>or<I> restoration</I>.
<P></P>
The secrets of this malignant incantation are known only to the scant few
priests who serve the cold gods of Pestilence and Decay. It is rumored that some
Plague Priests must willingly accept this curse for their religion. Invoking a
plague curse ages the caster by one year. The material component is the priest?s
unholy symbol and a small ball of myrrh.
