This book provides information of use to players of thief characters, and to
DMs running campaigns including thieves. The emphasis lies heavily upon a
campaign where many Pcs are thieves, but there is no reason provisions in this book
cannot be employed by groups with but a single thief among them.
<P></P>
None of the information here changes any existing AD&amp;D® 2nd Edition rule.
Instead, the idea is to amplify and detail those rules for players who are
interested in playing thief characters. Indeed, it is possible and in fact quite easy
to play a thief character without the information herein.
<P></P>
However, the player who wishes to develop his player character thief in a
unique fashion, or who seeks aid in deepening and broadening the character's
personality, goals, and motivations, will find helpful suggestions and ideas in the <I>Complete Thief's Handbook</I>.
<P></P>
But the book is a guide for DMs as well. Information on organizing thieves'
guilds, for example, is essential to any ongoing thief campaign. If no guild is
present, consistent information on other societal sanctions needs to be
determined by the DM—and the information must be available to players as well.
<P></P>
Consequently, no portion of this book is prohibited to player viewing, nor is
any part of it irrelevant to the activities of a good DM.
<P></P>
New rules and procedures only become official campaign rules in a campaign
where the DM so declares. Players who wish to employ some of these materials can
certainly ask the DM to use them, but as always, the Dungeon Master has the last
word.
