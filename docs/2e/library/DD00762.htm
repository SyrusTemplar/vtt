<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Ability to use scroll spells does not permit a priest to use a wizard spell,
or a wizard to use a priest spell. Likewise, it does not extend the ability of
spell use to non-spell-using characters except with respect to protection
scrolls. Anyone can use a protection scroll. Paladins and rangers cannot use priest
scrolls.
<P></P>
Those characters able to read and employ scroll spells can do so regardless of
other restrictions. Once the spell is known, it is not necessary to use a <I>read magic</I> spell in order to invoke its powers. Scrolls can be read even by mages who
are unable to employ the spell copied because of an inability to learn it or
because it is too high level (although, in the latter case, there is a chance of
spell failure).
