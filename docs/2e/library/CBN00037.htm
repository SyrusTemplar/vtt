</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This combination has interesting possibilities. Many psionic disciplines
(particularly psychometabolism) include abilities which affect the processes of
healing, disease, and death—perfect powers for the necromancer. For instance,
Tanith Lee’s <I>novel Kill the Dead</I> explores the theme of a psychic ghost hunter whose mental powers enable him
to sense and manipulate spiritual forces. Indeed, it is easy to imagine how
dabbling with such psychic skills could lead to a wizard’s career in the Art.
<P></P>
If the DM is interested in further exploring the theme of the necromantic
psionicist, refer to DRAGON® #200, where “The Even More Complete Psionicist”
details the Spiritualist Kit: a psionicist who specializes in communicating with the
spirits of the dead. The Spiritualist could play a similar in role in a
campaign to the Witch necromancer who serves primarily as a diviner. For more
psionicist kits and further ideas to flesh out a dual-classed necromancer/psionicist,
see also “Open Your Mind” in DRAGON #191.

Along with the requisite 17 Int, this dual-classed character would require a
15 Con (in addition to the usual 16 Wis). An NPC’s level of experience as a
psionicist may be quickly determined by rolling 2d4 (resulting in 2nd to 8th
level). While the character would undoubtedly benefit from a psionicist’s wide range
of mental abilities (as detailed in the <I>Complete Psionics Handbook</I>), the added complexity could render the NPC difficult to role-play
effectively. Those DM’s wishing to integrate psionics with the necromancer in a more
limited and manageable fashion may care to employ wild talents rather than
full-fledged psionicists.
