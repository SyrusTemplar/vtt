A character with this proficiency is skilled at laying ambushes and setting up
surprise attacks. Most characters can set up an adequate ambush when the
terrain favors it and they know the enemy is coming, but a character who spends a
slot on this skill is able to create ambushes where ambushes wouldn-t normally be
possible.
<P></P>
Ambushes are impossible if the attackers have already been spotted by the
victims; there's no point in hiding then. If the ambushing party knows their quarry
is coming to them, they can lay an ambush. If the attack is going to take
place in difficult or unusual circumstances, a proficiency check may be called for;
failure indicates that the victims have spotted the ambush before they walk
into it. Otherwise, the ambush is guaranteed to achieve surprise.
