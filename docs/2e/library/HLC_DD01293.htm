When two spellcasters have a disagreement that can-t be solved amicably, a
magical duel is often the best way to resolve the dispute. Duels are also fought
to prove who is more proficient in the magical arts, and many apprentices enter
magical duels with their peers to demonstrate their skills. The duel is a
highly refined form of combat, more subtle than simply squaring off and hurling
spells until an opponent fails a saving throw and infinitely more subtle than
physical combat.

To conduct a magical duel, the opponents must seek out a third spellcaster who
agrees to oversee the event and assist with the construction of the arena
where it is to take place. It often helps bring a few friends along to the duel
site to help guard against treachery or unwelcome interventions from third parties.
