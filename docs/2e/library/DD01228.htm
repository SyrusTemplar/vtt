Each world has four different aspects that combine to define its own unique
reality. These are chronology, magic, technology, and environment. Each aspect is
rated on a scale ranging from 2 to 20. Ratings can be generated randomly by
rolling 2d10. The lower the rating, the weaker the aspect is; ratings from 10?12
reflect conditions on typical AD&amp;D campaign worlds. Though a rating of 10 is
weaker than a rating of 12 the differences between the two are imperceptible to
player characters. Ratings higher than 20 and lower than 2 are possible, but all
known planes fall within these extremes.

A world-s rating is usually fixed, but the ratings on some worlds shift slowly
over time. These shifts are so gradual that the residents don-t realize they
are occurring. An abrupt shift-even for the better-brings cataclysmic change to
a world.
