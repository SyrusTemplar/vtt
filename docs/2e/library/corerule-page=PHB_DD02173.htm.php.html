This spell creates the lowest of the undead monsters, skeletons or zombies,
usually from the bones or bodies of dead humans, demihumans, or humanoids. The
spell causes these remains to become animated and obey the simple verbal commands
of the caster, regardless of how they communicated in life. The skeletons or
zombies can follow the caster, remain in an area and attack any creature (or
just a specific type of creature) entering the place, etc. The undead remain
animated until they are destroyed in combat or are turned; the magic cannot be
dispelled.
<P></P>
The priest can animate one skeleton or one zombie for each experience level he
has attained. If creatures with more than 1+ Hit Dice are animated, the number
is determined by the monster Hit Dice. Skeletal forms have the Hit Dice of the
original creature, while zombie forms have 1 more Hit Die. Thus, a 12th-level
priest could animate 12 dwarven skeletons (or six zombies), four zombie gnolls,
or a single zombie fire giant. Note that this is based on the standard racial
Hit Die norm; thus, a high-level adventurer would be animated as a skeleton or
zombie of 1 or 2 Hit Dice, and without special class or racial abilities. The
caster can, alternatively, animate two small animal skeletons (1-1 Hit Die or
less) for every level of experience he has achieved.
<P></P>
The spell requires a drop of blood, a piece of flesh of the type of creature
being animated, and a pinch of bone powder or a bone shard to complete the
spell. Casting this spell is not a good act, and only evil priests use it frequently.
