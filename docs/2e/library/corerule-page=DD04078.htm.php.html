Troglodytes are a warlike race of carnivorous reptilian humanoids that dwell
in natural subterranean caverns and in the cracks and crevices of mountains.
They hate man above all other creatures and often launch bloody raids on human
communities in search of food and steel.
<P></P>
Troglodytes stand about 6 feet tall, are covered in roughened leathery scales,
and have a toothy lizard-like head. Males are easily distinguished from
females by the fin-like crest that runs across their heads and down their necks.
Coloration for both sexes varies due to the troglodyte's chameleon-like ability to
change skin tone, but grayish brown is most common. Most troglodytes wear
little more than a leather weapons belt, with perhaps a small bag of semi-fresh
meat. Leaders adorn their belts with pieces of steel, a sign of power in troglodyte
culture. Troglodytes have excellent infravision (90-foot range). They speak
their own language and no other.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Fifty percent of a troglodyte force use their teeth and claws. The remaining
50% use weapons: swords (5%), stone battle axes (10%), stone morning stars
(10%), or two troglodyte javelins (25%). Of special note is the troglodyte javelin.
These great darts grant a +3 bonus to the attack roll when thrown by a
troglodyte; they cause 2d4 points of damage. This bonus reflects the troglodytes' great
skill with these darts. About 25% of troglodytes carry two such darts apiece.
<P></P>
Troglodytes prefer ambushes to frontal assaults. Their favorite tactic is to
pick a well-trod mountain or subterranean path and then use their chameleon
power to blend in with the surrounding rocks. When a likely target walks by, the
troglodytes hurl a volley of javelins (this attack gives opponents a -4 penalty
to their surprise rolls, but only for the initial round). After a second volley,
the troglodytes descend upon their hapless victims.
<P></P>
When angered or engaged in melee, troglodytes secrete an oil that smells
extremely disgusting to all humans and demihumans. Those failing their saving throws
vs. poison are so revolted as to lose 1d6 points of Strength. This loss
remains in effect for 10 rounds.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Troglodyte society is organized into clans, with each clan led by a chieftain
(usually the biggest and most fearsome troglodyte). A number of subchieftains
also are present, chosen from those troglodytes that most distinguished
themselves in battle. Rank is loose and internal squabbles common. Most chieftains lead
only as long as the clan stays fed (and not one meal longer).
<P></P>
For every 10 troglodytes encountered there is one leader with 3 Hit Dice. For
every 20 there are two subchieftains each with 4 Hit Dice. Groups of 60 or more
always include the clan chieftain. The chieftain stands 7 feet tall, has 6 Hit
Dice, and is accompanied by 2d4 guards with 3 Hit Dice each.
<P></P>
Troglodytes usually set their lair near a human or demihuman settlement. This
enables them to prey on both the settlers and their livestock. The lair itself
is typically a large cave or cavern with a number of smaller chambers adjoining
it for the females and hatchlings. Troglodyte lairs contain a number of
females equal to 100% of the males. Females have 1+1 Hit Dice each and fight to the
death in defense of the hatchlings. Hatchlings number about 50% of the male
population and are noncombatants.
<P></P>
Troglodytes value steel above all else, using it to make javelins and as a
form of wealth. Individual troglodytes carry nothing of real worth, but their lair
may contain considerable treasure amassed from their raids on the outside
world. Often this wealth is carelessly strewn about, mixed in with half-eaten food,
or just shoved into some out-of-the-way corner.
<P></P>
On moonless nights, raiding parties of 50 or more troglodytes venture forth in
search of steel and food. These attacks usually target human settlements,
where the troglodytes can use their infravision and their chameleon power to
maximum advantage.
<P></P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Strict carnivores, troglodytes prefer human flesh over all others, but they
won't hesitate to devour practically anything they can catch, including members
of other troglodyte clans. Few creatures hunt troglodytes, for their taste is
said to be even more vile than their odor.
