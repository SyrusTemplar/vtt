</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Once cast, a spell acquires a physical form and moves across the space between
the combatants, taking effect only when it reaches the opponent. Spells are
not readily identifiable, but detect magic and the spellcraft proficiency can
identify them. To help keep track of spells, players should secretly record the
spells their characters cast. Writing the spells’ names on a piece of folded
cardboard creates a marker that can easily be moved across the grid (3” x 5” index
cards cut in half, then folded are ideal).
<P></P>
A spell never leaves the arena or affects creatures outside the arena.
Remember that the combatants themselves are not in the arena—magical constructs
represent them. It is not possible for combatants to cast spells upon themselves. For
example, a priest involved in a duel can cast <I>cure light</I> <I>wounds</I>, but the spell appears in the arena—it does not heal any damage the caster
has suffered. Likewise, a wizard can use a <I>teleport</I> spell, but the spell merely travels across the arena toward the opponent—it
does not whisk the caster away to another place. Spells also do not truly affect
the opponent. A <I>charm person</I> or <I>imprisonment</I> spell might fight its way to the opponent’s space, but when the spells take
effect, the caster neither controls nor imprisons his opponent. Instead, the
opponent’s actions are restricted until he can throw off their effects (see the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01303.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01303.htm.php.html">Characters vs. Spells</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> section for details).
<P></P>
If a spell encounters an opposing spell on its way across the arena, the two
spells might struggle to annihilate each other before continuing on or they
might pass each other. Each spell has three characteristics that govern its
behavior in the arena: Type, Movement, and Power Rank.
