<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Improving Proficiencies</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Once an adventurer possesses a proficiency, spending character points can
improve the adventurer-s performance when that proficiency is used. The section
on <A HREF="DD03010.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03010.htm">using proficiencies</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> describes how to determine an initial rating-which varies for the different
proficiencies and can be modified by character ability scores.
<P></P>
This initial rating can be improved by spending additional character points
during the course of an adventurer-s career. For the most part, new characters
will have a beginning level of proficiency, though the DM and player may agree on
a rationale to explain a novice character-s high degree of proficiency. A
young woman who embarks on a life of adventure, for example, after being raised
beside her father-s potter-s wheel, might have a significant level of
accomplishment at the pottery skill.
<P></P>
Spending character points can improve an adventurer-s proficiency performance.
This is a one for one exchange?1 character point increases the character-s
chance of success by one. A nonweapon proficiency only can be increased through
character points once each level.
<P></P>
As a general rule, adventurers can add 1 character point to a given
proficiency each time they advance a level of experience. They don-t have to use the
point at the time they reach the new level.
<P></P>
For example, Bellerana the wizard advances from 2nd to 3rd level. She spends 1
character point to improve her rope use proficiency. And she spends another to
improve spellcraft.
<P></P>
It is possible to create exceptions to this limitation. A character who ceases
adventuring for a while, and devotes much of that time to farming or laboring
in a blacksmith shop, might continually improve his agriculture or blacksmith
proficiency even while he does not advance in levels in his character class.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Characters cannot improve their unmodified ratings in nonweapon proficiencies
above 16. This can be modified upward by the characters? relevant ability
scores, or by a trait that improves their score in that specific proficiency.
<P></P>
Regardless of how high a character-s modified proficiency rating becomes, a
roll of 20 on a proficiency check is always a failure.
