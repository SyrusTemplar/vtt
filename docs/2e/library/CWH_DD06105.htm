The DM and players will need to brainstorm for ideas that will eventually be
developed to fill in the basic spell list. Although the DM makes the final
decisions when designing spells for a new school, the contributions and ideas of the
players are important. Fantasy literature is another good source of ideas, as
are the abilities of magical monsters and functions of magical devices. The DM
and his players might also discuss encounters or battles from previous
adventures and decide what types of spells would have been useful for the wizards.
<P></P>
The DM (with the assistance of the players) should then assign a spell name to
each idea and decide the general effects of the potential spells. The names of
the spells should be brief and descriptive. The effects can be approximate at
this point-- they'll be refined later. We do not have the space here to develop
a full range of spells for our metamorphics school, but here are three
potential spells we'll use as examples:
<P></P>
<I>Evaporate:</I> This spell changes liquids into gases.
<P></P>
<I>Blood to dust:</I> This spell changes an opponent's blood to dust, instantly killing him.
<P></P>
<I>Improved armor:</I> This spell changes a companion's armor to a better Armor Class
