Although druids do not claim to &quot;own&quot; sacred groves, they take responsibility
for them very seriously. The druid associated with a grove normally goes by the
title of steward, keeper, or caretaker. Stewardship of a sacred grove is
traditional: Keepers always designate their successors.

The steward of a sacred grove is first and foremost responsible for the
grove's safety, especially if the grove has &quot;awakened&quot; with magical powers (explained
later in this chapter) or if beings such as dryads live there. Therefore,
druids devote considerable effort to protecting a sacred grove--in some cases,
through secrecy. Only a few trustworthy people and creatures know the grove's
location. A druid obscures the pathway to the grove, while <I>hallucinatory forest</I> spells and better-cleared false trails twist away from it, leading a searcher
astray.
<P></P>
More active defenses include pits covered with branches and leaves (perhaps
sharp stakes, poisonous spiders, or snakes). Druids of at least 5th level use the <I>snare </I>spell liberally, as its defenses remain fixed until triggered. Using <I>plant growth</I> to set up permanent dense barriers around the grove is a very good strategy,
especially if a druid plans to lace the obvious paths through these barriers
with traps and snares, leaving only one or two concealed &quot;safe&quot; passages.
<P></P>
If enemies are on their way, the druid should strive to prevent them from
using fire to damage the grove. Controlling weather to create a rainstorm before
foes even reach the grove keeps the enemy miserable and stops the grass, bushes,
and wood from igniting. Of course, one of the best ways a druid can defend a
grove is to discover potential enemies and strike before they even reach the
sacred natural site. (See &quot;Eyes in the Wilderness,&quot; Chapter 4.)

<P></P>

<P></P>
While safeguarding the grove remains most important, stewards must not neglect
regular care. This day-to-day work involves tending the plants and animals in
the grove, talking to them, and dealing with illnesses or parasites that might
appear. In addition, if a druid prefers a gardenlike appearance to a wild one,
the steward cleans up loose branches, prunes trees and bushes, and so on.
Druids should devote 12 days per month to this job, or about three days per week. If
a druid fails in this duty, the DM can assume the sacred grove's health and
appearance deteriorates (as does the magic of awakened groves, lesser powers
first). Deterioration is immediately obvious to any visiting druid.
<P></P>
Several druids may use the same sacred grove as a place of worship, sharing
the work detailed above, but only one is its steward; the others usually consider
themselves the sacred grove's tenders. By tradition, if the keeper dies or
retires, one of the tenders takes over the stewardship.
<P></P>
It is considered a crime for one druid in the Order to forcibly displace
another from a stewardship. Such an incident, when reported to the great druid,
constitutes grounds for the ban. In response, several druids will join together to
expel the offender from the grove, finding a more suitable replacement--the
original steward, if that druid did not die in the grove's defense.
<P></P>
An exception is allowed when a druid's negligence results in the deterioration
or defilement of a sacred grove. In this case, an inner circle druid or the
great druid appoints a new keeper for the grove. It becomes that druid's
responsibility to reclaim the grove, by force if necessary, from its inept steward.

<P></P>
<P></P>
Druids, far stricter about protecting their sacred groves than any other
wilderness area, have established a law to safeguard these special sites. The
following points make up the law of the grove, upheld by all except the steward and
those with special dispensation from the steward:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> No trees or plants within the grove may be harmed, cut, or pruned. No one may
pick or cut branches, berries, nuts, or fruit, either; visitors can eat or
otherwise use only that which has fallen to the ground.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> No one may fight within the grove.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> No bird or animal within a sacred grove may be harmed. If a hunted creature
flees into the grove, hunters must break off the chase; they cannot shoot at the
beast from outside the grove once it enters.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> No one may fish in the waters of a grove, nor foul these waters in any way.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> None may light a fire within a grove's bounds--not even tinder or a pipe.
<P></P>
The maximum penalty for violating the law of the grove is death, though a
druid may apply a lesser penalty in certain cases. The punishment for violating
these rules--or for more serious defilement of a sacred grove--depends on the
offender's motives, the damage, and the druid's inclination. If a cruel wizard
damaged a sacred grove with a <I>fireball</I> in an attack on the steward, the druid would think death a proper
punishment-- preferably death by fire. On the other hand, if a careless toddler did the
same damage by accidentally setting fire to the grove, the druid seeks a more
suitable punishment: kidnaping the child to raise as a druid. Thus the child
devotes a lifetime to atonement.
<P></P>
Note that there is no law against folk entering the grove. While some druids
keep visitors away, others welcome people and animals who come to admire the
grove or worship, and even shelter needy travelers. Similarly, the steward may
allow visitors to collect fallen deadwood, fruits, nuts, and berries. Since druids
usually can speak with the animals, plants, and (sometimes) stones in their
grove, they can determine easily how a person acquired suspicious bounty.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Becoming a Steward
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
A druid player character can acquire stewardship of a sacred grove in four
ways:
<P></P>
First, the keeper of a grove might nominate the PC to become the successor to
the stewardship. This tactic allows the PC to take over when the existing
steward dies, disappears, or decides not to care for the grove any longer. The
successor must have the current steward's trust and respect, and usually has spent
time worshiping in the grove and tending it under supervision. Most of all, the
nominee must prove worthy to defend the grove. If the grove has magic, the
character should have reached at least 7th level to deserve consideration. However,
young sacred groves lacking magic often receive the protection of lower-level
druids.
<P></P>
Second, a player character can find an abandoned sacred grove and reclaim it.
Sometimes a powerful monster or other foe eliminates both the steward of a
sacred grove <I>and </I>the chosen successor. Such groves often are cursed, haunted by undead, or
frequented by local monsters. But a druid who overcomes these obstacles and
reclaims the grove proves worthy of the stewardship.
<P></P>
Third, a stewardship may come with a title, although this practice varies from
circle to circle. For instance, a circle may award the responsibility for
certain sacred groves to its archdruids or great druid, and--unlike a normal
grove--this stewardship changes hands as new druids assume the high ranks. At the
DM's discretion, the world might even hold a wondrous &quot;high sacred grove&quot;-- the
responsibility of the Grand Druid.
<P></P>
Fourth, a PC can find a virgin grove site and sanctify it. Virgin groves match
the physical requirements listed earlier for a sacred grove, but have no
magical powers and have never been tended. Finding such a spot is simply a matter of
the druid's knowledge of local geography. A virgin grove rarely has clear
boundaries, so the druid may make &quot;improvements,&quot; such as planting a circle of
trees or erecting standing stones to mark the new grove's borders.
