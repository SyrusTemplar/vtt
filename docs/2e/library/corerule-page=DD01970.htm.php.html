When a <I>vacancy</I> spell is cast, the wizard causes an area to appear to be vacant, neglected,
and unused. Those who behold the area see dust on the floor, cobwebs, dirt, and
other conditions typical of a long-abandoned place. If they pass through the
area of effect, they seem to leave tracks, tear away cobwebs, and so on. Unless
they actually contact some object cloaked by the spell, the place appears empty.
Merely brushing an invisible object does not cause the <I>vacancy</I> spell to be disturbed: Only forceful contact grants a chance to note that all
is not as it seems.
<P></P>
If forceful contact with a cloaked object occurs, those creatures subject to
the spell can penetrate the spell only if they discover several items that they
cannot see; each being is then entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. Failure
means they believe that the objects are invisible. A <I>dispel magic</I> spell cancels this spell so that the true area is seen. A <I>true seeing</I> spell, a <I>gem of seeing</I>, and similar effects can penetrate the deception, but a <I>detect invisibility</I> spell cannot.
<P></P>
This spell is a very powerful combination of invisibility and illusion, but it
can cloak only nonliving things. Living things are not made invisible, but
their presence does not otherwise disturb the spell.
<P></P>
The wizard must have a square of the finest black silk to cast this spell.
This material component must be worth at least 100 gp and is used up during
spellcasting.
