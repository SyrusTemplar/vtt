This is an option only for Fighting-Monks (and Warrior characters); other
Priests <I>may not do this.
<P></P>
</I> If a Fighting-Monk continues to devote Weapon Proficiency slots to an unarmed
combat style <I>after he is already specializing in it</I>, he gets the following benefits.
<P></P>
For each additional slot devoted to his art, as before:
<P></P>
He gains a +1 bonus to all his attack rolls with his combat style;
<P></P>
He gains a +1 bonus to all damage with his combat style; and
<P></P>
He gains a +1 chart bonus with all attacks in that combat style. With chart
bonuses of +2 or more, the character can choose any maneuver within the range of
maneuvers covered by his chart bonus (see the example below).
<P></P>
A Fighting-Monk, once he has specialized in a fighting style, can only devote
one Weapon Proficiency slot to that style <I>per experience level</I>. Therefore, a first-level Fighting-Monk could specialize in Martial Arts by
devoting two slots to it. He could not devote another slot to it until second
level, and then could not devote another slot until third level, and so on.
<P></P>
Let's use that character as an example.
<P></P>
<I>Example: Toshi the Fighting-Monk specializes in Martial Arts at first level,
adds one proficiency slot to it at second level, and another at third level.
<P></P>
At third level, he has a +3 bonus to attack rolls with Martial Arts, a +3 to
damage rolls with Martial Arts, and a +3 chart bonus.
<P></P>
Let's say he rolls a 17 to hit someone, and that the attack does hit. This
would normally be a Vitals-Punch. But he has a +3 chart bonus. He can choose for
the maneuver to be a Head Punch, a High Kick, a Vitals-Kick, the Vitals-Punch
that was rolled, a Head Bash, a Side Kick, or an Elbow Shot. Assuming that he
takes the punishing Head Punch, he'll do 3 points for the maneuver, +3 points from
the damage bonus he gets for specializing, and any bonus his Strength grants
him. </I>

That, in brief, is the way Martial Arts works for the fighting-monk. You are
encouraged to read the Combat chapter of <I>The Complete Fighter's Handbook</I> for more rules and guidelines on the use of unarmed combat in the game.
