<FONT SIZE="3">This spell conjures a corrosive, acidic slime of
horrid strength on one surface or creature within the spell&#146;s
range. Up to one square foot of surface area per caster level can be
affected, so a 5th-level caster can affect 5 square feet&#151;enough
to create a 2-foot by 3-foot hole in a door or wall, or thoroughly
drench a man-sized creature. The acid eats through 6 inches of wood,
leather, or bone, 4 inches of stone, or 1 inch of metal each round.
Against monsters composed of stone, metal, or wood, the solvent
inflicts 1d3 points of damage per caster level per square foot
affected in the first round, 1d2 per caster level in the second
round, and 1 per two caster levels in the third and final round.
Therefore, a 10th-level wizard who strikes a treant with <I>solvent
of corrosion </I>inflicts 10d3, then 10d2, and finally 5 points of
damage. Each round, the victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spell
for half damage.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Against flesh, the solvent is much less effective; it
is caustic and burns painfully, inflicting 1 point of damage per
caster level in the first round, but no further damage in the second
or third round. However, the burning in the following rounds does
inflict a &#150;2 penalty to the victim&#146;s attacks while the
solvent is active. The solvent is extremely likely to cause extensive
damage to the victim&#146;s armor and equipment; item saving throws
vs. acid may apply at the DM&#146;s discretion. If the armor or
equipment is magical in nature, then the saving throw is made with
the usual bonuses allowed to the magical item.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The great alchemist Vandarien developed his solvent to
dissolve iron grates, stone and woodwork traps, and other such
hazards. The solvent&#146;s effectiveness against mineral or wood-based
creatures was a mere side effect of his research. The material
component of this spell is a mixture of vinegar, water, and a drop of
black dragon acid.</FONT></P>
