This power allows the user to move objects without touching them. Telekinesis
tends to be physically taxing, as it takes a lot of internal energy to move
objects. Small objects are easy. But larger, more massive objects are
significantly more difficult.
<P></P>
The cost listed above assumes the object being moved weighs three pounds or
less. For heavier objects, use the following:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> PSP cost equals the item’s weight in pounds.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The power’s MAC improves by a bonus equal to one-third of the item’s weight,
rounded down. For example, moving a 10–pound rock requires rolling against a MAC
of 5.

Telekinesis moves the targeted item up to 60 feet per round. Items moving at
such a slow rate of speed don’t make effective weapons, but items weighing more
than three pounds can be used to disrupt spellcasting or psionic use. The user
rolls his base THAC0 score to hit, with a penalty equal to one-third of the
item’s weight, rounded down. For example, if a hero whose THAC0 is 15 wants to
attack a priestess whose AC is 0, he needs an 18 or better to hit her with a
10–pound rock.
<P></P>
Telekinesis can be used to perform very fine work, such as writing or sewing.
The user must be capable of performing the work himself, and a second MTHAC0
roll (and second round of power use) is needed to complete fine work. If the hero
wants to use the power to pull an item away from an opponent, use the rules
for psychic contests, except that the defender uses his Strength score to decide
the contest.
