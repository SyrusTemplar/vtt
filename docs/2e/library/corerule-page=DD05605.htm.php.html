<B>Description:</B> A prophet is one who receives signs, dreams, or clues about the future from
his god. Priests of the god of prophecy are prophets, but they aren't the <I>only</I> prophets. Priests of other gods can receive and pass along prophecies.
However, since this is rarer, the DM has the right to approve or disapprove any
character taking this Priest Kit.
<P></P>
To be a Prophet Priest, the character must have a Wisdom of 15 or better.
<P></P>
A character may not abandon this kit. As long as he is a priest, he is a
Prophet Priest.
<P></P>
<B>Barred:</B> Priests of the god of Prophecy may not take this kit. All other priests may.
(Priests of philosophies or forces don't receive their prophecies from a god;
their prophecies are more like psychic impressions.)
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> In the campaign, the Prophet Priest is partly a tool for the DM; the DM can
use the character to supply clues and even red herrings to the characters. His
is often a thankless job, and he is often a bit alienated from the normal folk
(see &quot;Special Hindrances&quot; below).
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> The priest may choose his own secondary skill.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Required: None. Recommended: Any that the priest's actual priest-class
permits.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Bonus Proficiency: Weather Sense. Recommended: None special.
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> No special restrictions.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> The character receives the Medium Granted Power &quot;Prophecy&quot; from the Designing
Faiths chapter. However, it's more limited than the Prophecy which is granted
to priests of the god of Prophecy. With this power, priests may receive visions
from the god at any time the DM decides, but may only deliberately sink into a
trance in order to receive a vision once per day.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> It's not normal for anyone but priests of the god of Prophecy to be prophets.
Therefore, normal people are a little edgy around other prophets, and react to
them at a -2 reaction adjustment. (This adjustment may never result in a
reaction worse than Cautious, however.)
<P></P>
<B>Wealth Options:</B> This priest receives the normal 3d6x10 gp starting gold.
<P></P>
<B>Races:</B> No special limitations.
