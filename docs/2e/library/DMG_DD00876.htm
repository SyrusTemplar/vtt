<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Bag of Beans:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This bag, constructed of heavy cloth, is about two feet wide and four feet
long (the size of any other large bag or sack). A character who opens it will find
several large, pebble-like objects inside. If dumped out of the bag, these
objects explode for 5d4 points of damage each. All creatures within a 10 foot
radius must successfully save vs. spell or suffer full damage. To be removed
safely, the beans in the bag must be taken out by hand?<I>telekinesis</I> won't prevent them from exploding, nor will working them out with tools. If
placed in dirt and watered, each pebble-like bean will &quot;sprout'' a creature or
object. <I>Bags of beans</I> generally hold 3d4 beans, only 1 or 2 of which will be beneficial, the others
sprouting monsters or useless things. For example:
