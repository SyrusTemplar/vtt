<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Blind-fighting:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> This allows characters to ignore many of the problems inherent in fighting
without being able to see. In total darkness, the character suffers –2 (not –4)
to attack rolls, and suffers no penalties to AC versus melee attacks. In
starlight or moonlight, the character suffers only a –1 penalty to attack rolls.
<P></P>
When moving in darkness, the character is allowed to make a proficiency check
at the beginning of a round; success means no movement penalties are assessed
because of the darkness, while failure means the normal penalty applies.
<P></P>
When in combat with an invisible creature, the character with blind-fighting
proficiency suffers only a –2 to attack rolls, but gains no benefit toward
discovering the creature.
