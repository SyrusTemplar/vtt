</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Not every weapon can harm a legendary monster. This power can work in several
different ways:
<P></P>
<I>Weapon Type:</I> The creature suffers no damage from a single type of weapon (bludgeoning,
piercing, or slashing).
<P></P>
<I>Normal Weapon:</I> The creature suffers no damage from ordinary weapons and is harmed only by
weapons made from a special material (silver, cold-wrought iron, stone, wood,
etc.).
<P></P>
<I>Nonmagical Weapon:</I> The creature can be harmed only by enchanted weapons. Lesser scions with this
power usually can be harmed by +1 or better weapons. Scions and elders are
harmed by +2 or better weapons, and great elders and paragons by +3 or better
weapons.
