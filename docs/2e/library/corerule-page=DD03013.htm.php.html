<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Modifying Proficiency Rolls</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> As before, DMs are free to modify proficiency rolls for factors that will
influence success—for good or for ill. If a task is unusually difficult, apply a
penalty to the proficiency rating. Standard negative modifiers are –2 for a
somewhat difficult task, –4 for a moderately difficult task, and –8 for something
where success is a real long shot.
<P></P>
As a general rule, a proficiency should not be modified to greater than 19, or
less than 2; a roll of 20 is always a failure on a proficiency check.
Conversely, a roll of 1 always should be successful. Remember, if automatic success is
assured, no roll is necessary.
<P></P>
Modifiers should be considered for some of the following factors:

increased. Some proficiency checks that might be automatic successes under most
circumstances could require checks simply because they must be performed under a
deadline. A cobbler always can make a pair of shoes, but if they need to be done in
two hours, a proficiency check might be called for.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Materials:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Tasks performed in the field might require jury-rigging of equipment or
materials, and these can influence success—or require a check where the task might
otherwise by automatic. Our cobbler will need to make a check if he’s going to
repair a mangled boot in the depths of a wilderness forest; the same repair in
his shop would be an automatic success.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Danger:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Doing a task under a shower of arrows, or under the threat of imminent
attack, adds a strong element of tension to the proficient character. A task might
again be rendered more difficult than usual, or require a check instead of
automatic success, when there is a serious hazard nearby.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Uniqueness:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> If an unskilled character tries to perform a new task, a check might be
required. If our cobbler is required to make a pair of silken slippers studded with
rubies, for example, he might have to experiment a bit before he gets it right.
A unique problem can also modify a task that would already require a check. An
animal handler used to breaking and training horses might suffer a –4 penalty
if asked to do the same with a pegasus.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Intricacy:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> A task that is more involved than any the character has attempted before may
require a check, perhaps with a penalty assigned. A character with the
agriculture proficiency is normally able to plant and harvest crops—no proficiency
check is necessary. However, if the character is placed in charge of a farming
project where land must be cleared, irrigation arranged, pests controlled, and
precise timing used on the harvest, an agriculture proficiency check probably will
be required.
