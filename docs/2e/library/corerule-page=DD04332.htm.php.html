This unusual spell is similar to <I>phantasmal force</I> and other illusion magic, except that the priest who casts the spell is the
only creature who automatically believes the results of the spell. The spell
creates the illusion of any object, creature, or force, as long as it is within
the boundaries of the spell's area of effect. The illusion is visual and tactile
(that is, it can be seen and felt), but no other sensory stimuli are created.
<P></P>
<I>Solipsism</I> is the opposite of normal illusions in that anyone other than the caster must
make an active effort to <I>believe</I> (rather than dis believe) the illusion. Characters trying to believe the
reality of a solipsistic illusion must make a saving throw vs. breath weapon,
modified by the magical defense adjustment for Wisdom. A successful save means that
the character believes the illusion and it is part of reality for him. A failed
save means that the character cannot convince himself of the illusion's
reality, and the illusion has no effect on him. A character can make a single attempt
to believe each round.
<P></P>
Unlike true illusions, the image created by this spell does more than just
duplicate reality. The image formed is <I>real </I>for those who believe in it. The illusion has all the normal properties that
its form and function allow. Thus, a solipsistic bridge spanning a chasm could
be crossed by the priest and those who believed. All others would see the priest
apparently walking out onto nothingness. Likewise, a solipsistic giant would
cause real damage to those who believed it.
<P></P>
The illusion remains in effect for as long as the priest continues to
concentrate on it, until the priest is struck in combat, or until he is rendered
unconscious. The level of concentration required is not extreme; the priest can move
normally and may engage in combat, but is unable to cast any spell while
maintaining a <I>solipsistic</I> illusion.
<P></P>
<I>Solipsism</I> can create only illusions that are external to the priest. Thus, the priest
cannot create an illusion that he is the size of a giant, is unwounded, or has
sprouted wings.
<P></P>
The material components are a lotus blossom that the priest must swallow and a
bit of fleece.
