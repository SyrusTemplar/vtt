<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A druid kit works with the basic <I>PH</I> druid or with any of the branches described in the previous chapter. Thus, a
desert druid could be a Savage (coming from a primitive desert tribe), a
Wanderer (traveling the desert wastes), a Guardian (protecting a certain oasis), or
some other kit.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
When building your druid character, choose the branch first, as it has
specific ability score requirements. After that, pick from any of the applicable kits.
However, make sure you have enough proficiency slots to take the weapon and
nonweapon proficiencies required by both the branch and the kit--although in many
cases branch/kit proficiency requirements overlap.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Prior to letting players select kits, the DM should examine each kit and
decide whether it fits the overall campaign. The DM might want to restrict some kits
to NPCs or prohibit others altogether.
<P></P>
The DM also may wish to make changes or add material to some kits, to better
match the conditions of a particular campaign. Take the Savage druid, for
instance. If the campaign already features a primitive tribe of, say, pearl divers,
the DM might adjust the Savage kit to fit established details of that tribe's
cultural background for instance, the DM might make swimming a required or bonus
proficiency.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Druid kits occasionally receive reaction bonuses or penalties as part of their
special benefits and hindrances. A reaction adjustment due to either the druid
kit's requirements or an extreme Charisma score (<A HREF="PHB_DD01436.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01436.htm">PH, p. 18</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) is expressed as a bonus (+1, +2, etc.) or a penalty (-1, -2, etc.).
<P></P>
When rolling 2d10 for encounter reactions (<A HREF="DMG_DD00564.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00564.htm">Table 59</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, <I>DMG</I>, p. 103), the DM must subtract the bonus or <I>add </I>the penalty--not the other way around. For instance, the druid Snapdragon has
a combined +7 reaction adjustment bonus for her high Charisma and her druid
kit. The DM then subtracts 7 from the 2d10 encounter reaction roll to reflect the
bonus, due to the way Table 59 in the <I>DMG</I> is designed.

<P></P>
<P></P>
To record a druid kit on your character record sheet (pgs. 125-127), take the
following steps:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Add the name of the druid kit following the druid's branch. For instance, a
druid with the Hivemaster kit and the plains druid branch would be written as:
plains druid (Hivemaster).
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> When recording the character's proficiencies, put an asterisk next to those
the character received free through the druid kit. This will help you and your DM
remember how many proficiencies the character is due.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Where you have space (on the back of your character sheet or on a separate
piece of paper), write down the kit's special benefits, hindrances, and any other
features you wish to recall quickly. You also can use the space provided on a
copy of the druid character sheets.
