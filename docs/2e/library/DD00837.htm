* The whirlwind is identical to that caused by a dijinni.
<P></P>
** The staff can be used to conjure one elemental of each type per day, each
having
<P></P>
8 Hit Dice.
<P></P>
***Telekinesis is at 8th level also (i.e., 200 pounds maximum weight).

The <I>staff of the magi</I> adds a +2 bonus to all saving throw rolls vs. spell. It can be used to absorb
wizard spell energy directed at its wielder, but if the staff absorbs energy
beyond its charge limit, it will explode as if a &quot;retributive strike&quot; (see
below) had been made. The spell levels of energy absorbed count only as recharging
the staff, but they cannot be redirected immediately, so if absorption is
desired, that is the only action possible by the staff wielder that round. Note also
that the wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at him, for the
staff does not communicate this knowledge as a <I>rod of absorption</I> does. Absorbing spells is risky, but absorption is the only way this staff
can be recharged.
<P></P>
Retributive strike is a breaking of the staff. It must be purposeful and
declared by the wizard wielding it. When this is done all levels of spell energy in
the staff are released in a globe of 30-foot radius. All creatures within 10
feet of the broken staff suffer hit points of damage equal to eight times the
number of spell levels of energy in the rod (1 to 25), those between 10 feet to 20
feet take 6 x levels, and those 20 feet to 30 feet distant take 4 x levels.
Successful saving throws versus magic indicate only one-half damage is sustained.
<P></P>
The wizard breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane
of existence, but if he does not, the explosive release of spell energy totally
destroys him. This staff and the <I>staff of power</I> are the only magical items capable of a retributive strike.
