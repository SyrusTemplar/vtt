</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> As discussed in Chapter Two, wizards who practice black necromancy are subject
to the attention of evil, extraplanar powers that sometimes reward mortals
with supernatural powers (after a successful powers check). However, when a
sinister deity bestows the Dark Gift upon a mortal, the god usually exacts a personal
price which manifests as one of the many handicaps outlined in this section.
On the other hand, two new role-playing devices (the <I>disease check</I> and the <I>madness check</I>) can be used by the DM to introduce handicaps into the campaign without
divine or supernatural intervention. Regardless of their origin, disabilities help
define a distinctive and memorable villain for the campaign.
<P></P>
The DM may also care to bestow these handicaps on PCs who willingly employ
black necromancy. Handicaps are a good, role-playing alternative to the imposition
of “alignment shock” described in the<I> DMG</I>. A handicap system also helps explain why the Art is viewed with universal
fear and loathing in the campaign.
<P></P>
Of course, certain players may relish playing a slightly twisted wizard
character. Even then, the handicaps will serve to enhance role-playing in the
campaign. As a rule of thumb, however, the DM should never assign a handicap that
would completely cripple a wizard character and prevent him or her from casting
spells.
<P></P>
For every Dark Gift bestowed on a necromancer (<A HREF="corerule-page%3dCBN00032.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dCBN00032.htm.php.html">see Chapter Two</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">), the DM should choose an appropriate handicap for the character.
Alternatively, the DM may roll a d4 and consult the appropriate subsection as listed on
the table directly below.

1. Physical Deformity

2. Bodily Affliction
<P></P>
3. Insanity or Madness

4. Unholy Compulsion
