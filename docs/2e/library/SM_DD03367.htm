<P></P>
Sure, the AD&amp;D? game can be played without spellcasters, enchanted monsters,
or magical items. Everyone can still role-play brave heroes, confront deadly
foes, and attempt great quests or deeds of mythical proportions. In fact, it can
be fun and challenging to do so in a nonmagical setting. But the point remains
that magic, more than any other characteristic, defines the AD&amp;D game. As a <I>fantasy</I> role-playing game, AD&amp;D is anchored in the traditions of fantasy literature,
and fantasy literature by definition features some element of magic. Even if
the heroes of a fantasy story distrust or dislike magic, it?s still there in the
background as part of the world they live in.
<P></P>
Generally, most writers of fantasy literature create their own unique systems
of magic to explain the supernatural powers their heroes and villains employ.
With great care and deliberate effort, authors define what magic can and cannot
do in their worlds. For example, in <I>The Lord of the Rings</I>, J.R.R. Tolkien circumscribes the wizard Gandalf?s power by placing
restrictions on Gandalf?s freedom of action. The great wizard is bound by a code of
secrecy and noninterference that prevents him from directly challenging the power
of Sauron, and he can only help and advise as the Free Peoples of Middle-earth
fight their own battles. Jack Vance?s <I>Dying Earth</I> stories assume that wizards must study complicated patterns and formulae to
memorize very specific spells that may only be used once before vanishing from
the wizard?s memory. (Sound familiar?)
<P></P>
There are very good reasons for limiting magic?s power from a literary point
of view. Modern readers need to see real challenges and obstacles for the
characters in a story, and magic systems that are too open-ended can wreck a story?s
credibility and sense of suspense. If Gandalf could have just <I>wished</I> the One Ring into the fires of Mount Doom from Frodo?s living room, what
would have been the point of the trek to Mordor? Since fantasy role-playing games
are flexible models of the fantasy genre, the same considerations are true for
them. A fantasy RPG has to set very precise rules for how magic works and what
it can do, and the presentation and workings of the magic system inevitably
become the game?s salient characteristics.
<P></P>
<P></P>
In fantasy literature, it?s common for a magic system to be defined for only
one world-setting at a time by a single author (although shared-world concepts
are fairly common, too). The AD&amp;D game?s magic system represents a common
framework built up by hundreds of designers, Dungeon Masters, and players over more
than twenty years. There are <I>thousands </I>of spells and magical items defined?a volume of material that is an order of
magnitude larger than any other magic system in games or fiction. The basic
assumptions of what magic is and how it works in the AD&amp;D game are shared by
literally millions of gamers and fantasy fans. Despite the immense importance of
magic to the game, it is one of the few areas that has remained nearly unchanged to
date in the evolution of the game. Magic never changed in function; it simply
grew amoeba-like, adding more and more spells and items while the basic,
underlying assumptions remained the same.
<P></P>
<I>Player?s Option?: Spells &amp; Magic </I>examines the AD&amp;D magic system from every angle. First, the spellcasting
classes?wizards, priests, and less dedicated magic wielders such as bards or
rangers?will be examined in detail. The various schools and spheres of spells are
reorganized and new class abilities are introduced, along with an optional
point-based character class design system compatible with the <I>Player?s Option: <A HREF="SP_DD02929.htm"></A></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="SP_DD02929.htm">Skills &amp; Powers</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>rulebook. New proficiencies and detailed information about wizard and priest
equipment adds depth and variety to any campaign. A new magic memorization and
casting system is introduced in <A HREF="DD03506.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03506.htm">Chapter 6</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> , providing new ways to customize a character?s spell selection. Spells in

included in this book.
<P></P>
Like any of the Player?s Option books, the material in this supplement is
optional. The DM is free to use as much or as little of <I>Spells &amp; Magic </I>as he wishes to in his campaign. However, we have tried to present systems
that do not contradict each other, so it is possible to use all the rules
additions and expansions without any difficulty.
