Before you agree that a character is hopeless, consider the player's motives.
Try to be firm and encourage players to give &quot;bad&quot; characters a try. They might
actually enjoy playing something different for a change.
<P></P>
A character with one or more very low score (6 or less) may seem like a loser,
like it would be no fun to play. Quite simply, this isn't true! Just as
exceptionally high scores make a character unique, so do very low scores. In the
hands of good role-players, such characters are tremendous fun. Encourage the
player to be daring and creative. Some of the most memorable characters from history
and literature rose to greatness despite their flaws.
<P></P>
In many ways, the completely average character is the worst of all.
Exceptionally good or exceptionally bad ability scores give a player something to base
his role-playing on--whether nimble as a cat or dumb as a box of rocks, at least
the character provides something exciting to role-play.
<P></P>
Average characters don't have these simple focal points. The unique, special
something that makes a character stand out in a crowd must be provided by the
player, and this is not always easy. Too many players fall into the &quot;he's just
your basic fighter&quot; syndrome.
<P></P>
In truth, however, even an average character is okay. The only really hopeless
character is the rare one that cannot qualify for any character class. The
playability of all other characters is up to you.
