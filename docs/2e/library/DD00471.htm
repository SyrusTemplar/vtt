When a creature is hit by a weapon to which it is immune, the attack appears
to leave a visible wound. However, no points of damage are inflicted.
<P></P>
For example, a vampire strides across the banquet hall toward the player
characters. Fearfully, they loose a volley of arrows at him. Three hit, but he
doesn't even break his stride. They watch, aghast, as he disdainfully plucks the
arrows from his body. Just as he closes with them, Targash swings and hits him
with his<I> sword +3</I>. The vampire's smug look of overconfidence is transformed to one of snarling
rage as he realizes with a shock that one of these sniveling humans has hurt
him!
