<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Smuggler </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Characters who earn a living by fencing questionable goods and moving
material about behind the backs of government officials are considered smugglers. They
are opportunists who have the right connections to guide stolen or suspicious
property about from place to place-at a considerable profit to themselves.
Smugglers rarely steal things themselves. They consider that much more risky than
transporting the goods and feigning ignorance about the goods? origins. And they
rarely keep materials they believe stolen-better to move the objects on to
another city. A few smugglers work as fences on the side. Smugglers love the
adventuring life because it gives them the opportunity to travel and the chance to
move goods. A smuggler might jump at the opportunity to delve into a dungeon
when the authorities are on the lookout for a matched set of emeralds he has in
his belt pouch.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Requirements:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Smugglers must have a minimum Wisdom/Willpower score of 12, as they must have
enough common sense to help them stay ahead of the law. This kit is open to
all races and classes, but paladin smugglers require special approval from the DM.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> These characters can select any weapon proficiencies allowed their
adventuring classes.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended nonweapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Appraising, forgery, gem cutting, ancient history, artistic ability,
etiquette, pottery, ancient languages, reading/writing.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Equipment:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Smugglers seek magical bracers and rings to make themselves more difficult to
be struck or seen. They will wear armor while adventuring-if their character
class allows it. However, they prefer to travel in loose-fitting street clothes
and unencumbered.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended traits:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Keen sense of touch, glibness, impersonation, lucky, obscure knowledge,
precise memory.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Benefits:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> If a smuggler chooses the appraising nonweapon proficiency, he gains a +2
bonus to that proficiency score.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hindrances:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Smugglers on occasion run afoul of the law-or of individuals who try to pass
goods via the character. When this happens, a smuggler might have to rely on
his fellow adventurers for protection.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wealth: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Smugglers begin with the maximum amount of gold allotted to their character
class to reflect the money they earn from their shady dealings.
