<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Thug</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> This kit is recommended only for non good-aligned characters. As the outlaw
makes his home and living on the fringes of civilization, the thug makes his
way in cities. A thug knows the streets and alleys, and he knows the shadowy
places best. In the darkest parts of town he lies in wait for unsuspecting
prey—such as travelers new to the city, those who become lost in the maze of streets
and alleys, and those on their way home after having a bit too much to drink.
Thugs might be street ruffians, members of press gangs, gang enforcers, or barroom
rowdies. In any case, they tend to be loud, obnoxious, and prone to violence.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Social ranks:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Most thugs come from low-income families, and it is this background that
leads them to their questionable lifestyle. Roll 2d6 to determine a thug’s social
rank.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Small or easily concealed weapons are the thug’s favorites, as they can be
carried most anywhere. These include: daggers, dirks, hand axes, knives,
blowguns, and slings. However, thugs can carry any weapon that is allowed by their
adventuring class.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended nonweapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Blind-fighting, endurance, gaming, jumping, rope use, running.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Equipment:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Most thugs like to wear as little armor and carry as few pieces of equipment
as possible—as they like to move about unencumbered. However, some thugs prefer
wearing bulky armor and carrying big weapons to intimidate others.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended traits: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Fast healer, keen eyesight, keen hearing, keen sense of touch, light sleeper.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Benefits:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Due to their rough-and-tumble lifestyle and penchant for street brawls, thugs
gain a +1 bonus to all damage rolls.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hindrances:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Thugs are often wanted by the local law enforcers. In a relatively confined
area such as a city, a thug can never relax. Around the next corner might be a
member of the constabulary—or the thug’s next victim.
