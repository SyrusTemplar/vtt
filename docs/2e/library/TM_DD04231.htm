When this spell is cast, the wizard brings into being a cat made of shadow.
The <I>shadowcat</I> is the size of a normal cat and may be either grey or black at the caster's
option. The caster has complete telepathic control of the feline; he can see,
hear, and even speak through it as long as it remains within range. At the moment
it moves out of range, the <I>shadowcat</I> vanishes. The caster does not need to concentrate on the <I>shadowca</I>t.
<P></P>
The shadowy feline is insubstantial, making subject only to magical or special
attacks, including those by weapons of +1 or better. It has AC 5, a movement
rate of 18, and saving throws equal to those of the caster. The cat dissipates
if it loses hit points equal to one-half the caster's total hit points. The <I>shadowcat</I> has no attacks of its own and cannot touch or carry objects. A successful <I>dispel magic</I> spell causes the cat to vanish.
<P></P>
A <I>shadowcat</I> makes no sound as it moves. It is 90% undetectable in all but the brightest
conditions. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings.
<P></P>
The material components of this spell are a black pearl of at least 100 gp
value and a claw from a grey or black cat.
