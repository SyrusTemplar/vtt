The cleric class is a very powerful one. He has access to sixteen Spheres of
Influence (more than <I>any </I>other priest-class), good armor, and fair weapons. It's been a sign of the
cleric's advantages that he is the preferred character class of many, many
campaigns.
<P></P>
If this ultra-efficient character is too powerful in your own campaign, you
might prefer to alter him. If you want to do this, tell all the cleric players
well ahead of time and give them the option to convert their clerics to priests
of specific mythoi provided in the <B>Sample Priesthoods</B> chapter.
<P></P>
Then, establish the following rules about the Cleric class:
<P></P>
(1) Keep his weapon and armor limitations exactly as they are.
<P></P>
(2) Establish that the Cleric has Major Access to only three spheres (one must
be All; the other two are player's choice) and Minor Access to two spheres
(player's choice). The player must choose his four sphere options when the Cleric
is first created (or converted); it may not be changed afterwards. Each Cleric
may choose a different set of spheres.
<P></P>
Naturally, you should only do this if you personally feel that the cleric
class is too powerful in your campaign. If you don't, don't change him.
