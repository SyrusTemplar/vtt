copying manuscripts. Even after printing presses were in widespread use, scribes
were in demand for their calligraphy and the quality of their illuminated (or
illustrated) pages. A character with this proficiency is familiar with a
scribe?s techniques for preparing pages and working both swiftly and accurately. This
is an invaluable skill for a wizard; with a successful proficiency check, the
character gains a +5% bonus to any rolls he must make in order to copy or
transcribe a spell into his spell book or onto a scroll.
