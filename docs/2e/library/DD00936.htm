<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Dust of Illusion:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This unremarkable powder resembles chalk dust or powdered graphiteâ€”unless it
is stared at. Stare at it and the dust changes color and form. Put a pinch of <I>dust of illusion</I> on a creature and the creature appears to become any other creature of
similar shape, with a size variance of 50% (plus or minus) from the actual size of
the affected creature. Thus, a halfling could appear as a human of small stature,
a human as an ogre, a pegasus as a mule, etc. An unwilling recipient is
allowed a saving throw vs. spell to escape the effect.
<P></P>
The individual who sprinkles the magical dust must envision the illusion
desired as the powder is shaken over the subject creature. The illusionary power
lasts for 1d6+6 hours unless otherwise dispelled.
<P></P>
A typical pouch of this dust contains 1d10+10 pinches of the substance.
