By means of this spell, a priest is able to project his astral body into the
Astral plane, leaving his physical body and material possessions behind on the
Prime Material plane. As the Astral plane touches upon the first levels of all
the outer planes, the priest can travel astrally to the first level of any of
these outer planes as he wills. The priest then leaves the Astral plane, forming
a body on the plane of existence he has chosen to enter. It is also possible to
travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material plane by means of the<I> astral</I> spell. However, a second body cannot be formed on the Prime Material plane.
<P></P>
As a general rule, a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures
on the Astral plane. The astral body is connected at all times to the material
body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed,
astrally and materially, but generally only the psychic wind can cause the cord
to break. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silvery cord
remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or astral form is
slain, the cord simply returns to the caster's body where the body rests on the
Prime Material plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation.
Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral plane, their actions
affect only creatures existing on the Astral plane; a physical body must be
materialized on other planes.
<P></P>
The spell lasts until the priest desires to end it, or until it is terminated
by some outside means, such as<I> dispel magic</I> spell or destruction of the priest's body on the Prime Material plane--which
kills the priest. The priest can project the astral forms of up to seven other
creatures with himself by means of the <I>astral</I> spell, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the priest. These
fellow travelers are dependent upon the priest and can be stranded if something
happens to the priest. Travel in the Astral plane can be slow or fast,
according to the priest's desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is subject to
the desire of the priest.
