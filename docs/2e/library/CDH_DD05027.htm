Mysterious guardian of a sacred grove, wise counselor to monarchs, cunning
master of many shapes, friend of animals, and terrible defender of unspoiled
Nature: This is the druid of the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons® game.
<P></P>
Although the priests of the Celtic tribes of Western Europe in the time of
Rome called themselves druids, the druids of the AD&amp;D® game are not Celtic
priests, nor do they practice the bloody rites that made the ancient druids infamous
in the eyes of Rome. Rather, these druids more closely resemble creatures of
Victorian romance and modern fantasy, Merlin figures who revere Nature and wield
power over plants, animals, the weather, and the elements.
<P></P>
This book is designed to illuminate the many abilities of druids and show how
the neutral and &quot;unaligned&quot; druid can best adventure with a party of
predominantly good characters. It also reveals what a druid does when not adventuring and
demonstrates how a druid can become the center of a new and exciting campaign.
<P></P>
<I>The Complete Druid's Handbook</I> adds numerous options to the druid class from the <I>Player's Handbook</I>, including druids from regions other than the woodlands, and introduces many
specialized druid kits. Also included are new spells and magical items, as well
as rules for a druid's sacred grove.
<P></P>
Those using this book with the AD&amp;D Original Edition game should know that
page references correspond with the AD&amp;D 2nd Edition<I> Player's Handbook</I> <I>(PH)</I> and <I>Dungeon Master® Guide (DMG).</I> The original druid class appears here as an appendix, with some material from
the AD&amp;D Original Edition reference book <I>Unearthed Arcana.</I>
