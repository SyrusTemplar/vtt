When the priest casts a raise dead spell, he can restore life to a dwarf,
gnome, half-elf, halfling, or human (other creatures may be allowed, at the DM's
option). The length of time that the person has been dead is of importance, as
the priest can raise persons dead only up to a limit of one day for each
experience level of the priest (i.e., a 9th-level priest can raise a person who has
been dead for up to nine days).
<P></P>
Note that the body of the person must be whole, or otherwise missing parts are
still missing when the person is brought back to life. Likewise, other ills,
such as poison and disease, are not negated. The raised person must roll a
successful resurrection survival check to survive the ordeal (see <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01430.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01430.htm.php.html">Table 3</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">: Constitution) and loses 1 point of Constitution. Further, the raised person
is weak and helpless, needing a minimum of one full day of rest in bed for each
day or fraction he was dead. The person has 1 hit point when raised and must
regain the rest by natural healing or curative magic.
<P></P>
A character's starting Constitution is an absolute limit to the number of
times he can be revived by this means.
<P></P>
The somatic component of the spell is a pointed finger.
<P></P>
The reverse of the spell,<I> slay living</I>, grants the victim a saving throw vs. death magic. If the saving throw is
successful, the victim sustains damage equal to that of a<I> cause serious wounds</I> spell--i.e., 2d8+1 points. Failure means the victim dies instantly.
