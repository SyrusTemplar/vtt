Various priesthoods will require priests to know certain skills (nonweapon
proficiencies) and be able to wield certain weapons (weapon proficiencies). For
example, a priest of the god of Agriculture must know the Agriculture
proficiency, while a priest of the god of Fire must know Fire-Building.
<P></P>
Every priesthood should require one nonweapon proficiency of its priests and
priestesses; it's a sign of their devotion. It's permissible, but not
recommended, for them to require more than one.
<P></P>
A priesthood <I>may </I>require one or more weapon proficiencies of its priests and priestesses, but
we don't recommend this for most priesthoods. Many faiths allow their priests so
few weapon choices anyway that it's pointless to<I> require</I> they be taken. An exception is when a god is noted for wielding a specific
weapon; for instance, it's quite reasonable to require Weapon Proficiency in
War-Hammer for priests of the god Thor, whose principal weapon and symbol was the
hammer.
