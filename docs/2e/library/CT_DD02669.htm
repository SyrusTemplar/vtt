</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Any brawling attack provokes an attack of opportunity from any and all
opponents who are armed and threatening the assailant. The defender gets a +4 bonus to
attack and damage rolls. If an attack of opportunity slays the attacker, there
is no brawling attack. If an attack of opportunity creates a knockdown chance,
the brawling attack automatically fails and is wasted, even if the attacker-s
saving throw succeeds and he is not knocked down-the defender's weapon keeps
the attacker at bay. If an attack of opportunity results in a critical hit, the
character who scored the hit can choose to roll for the critical hit (see <A HREF="DD02717.htm#bcdf214c"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02717.htm#bcdf214c">Chapter Six</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) or force the brawling attack to automatically fail.
