<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Stone Horse:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Each item of this nature appears to be full-sized, roughly hewn statue of a
horse, carved from some type of hard stone. A command word brings the steed to
life, enabling it to carry a burden, and even to attack as if it were a warhorse.
There are two sorts of steeds:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Courser:</I> This <I>stone horse</I> travels at the same movement rate as a light horse (movement rate 24) and
attacks as if it were a medium warhorse (three attacks for 1d6/1d6/1d3). It is
Armor Class 3 and has 18 hit points. It saves versus all applicable attack forms
as if it were &quot;Metal, hard.&quot;
<P></P>
<I>Destrier:</I> This <I>stone horse</I> travels at the same movement rate as a medium horse (movement rate 18) and
attacks as if it were a heavy warhorse (three attacks for 1d8/1d8/1d3). It is
Armor Class 1 and has 26 hit points. It saves versus all applicable attack forms
as if it were &quot;Metal, hard.&quot;
<P></P>
A <I>stone horse</I> can carry 1,000 pounds tirelessly and never needs to rest or feed. Damage
inflicted upon it can be repaired by first using a <I>stone to flesh</I> spell, thus causing the <I>stone horse</I> to become a normal horse. If then allowed to graze and rest, the animal will
heal its wounds at the rate of one point per day. When it is fully healed, it
will automatically revert to its magical form.
