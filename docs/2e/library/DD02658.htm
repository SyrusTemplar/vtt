Group: Warriors, Rogues Initial rating: 5
<P></P>
Veteran brawlers and soldiers acquire a repertoire of feints, ruses, and
various unsportsmanlike tactics that can come in handy in a fight. A character with
this “skill” can attempt to use a dirty trick once per fight; if he succeeds,
he gains a +1 bonus to his next attack roll. If there’s some reason the enemy
believes the character will fight honorably (hardly a wise assumption!) the bonus
is +2.
<P></P>
Once a particular enemy has fallen prey to the character’s dirty trick, he can
never be caught off-guard again. In addition, if the character’s opponent is
skilled in dirty fighting himself, the attempt automatically fails.
