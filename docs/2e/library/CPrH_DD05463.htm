Once all the principal characters (i.e., gods) are in place, the DM can create
the <I>events</I> of the faith.
<P></P>
The creation of the world was one such event; it described &quot;characters&quot; (gods)
acting or interacting, and something happening. The fall from grace of the
sentient races was another: How did that happen? But these shouldn't be the only
events known to the believers. What else has happened?
<P></P>
Do the gods mate with mortals to produce heroic characters who go on
adventures? If so, then the conception of these heroes and their adventures in life are
all events of the faith. (Note: If this process is still going on, some of the
campaign's player-characters could be the mortal children of the world's gods.)
<P></P>
How do specific gods get along together? Having determined that, the DM can
next determine why. If two gods hate each other, why? Did one steal from the
other, or embarrass him? That's an event.
<P></P>
Have the gods ever warred on one another? If so, that was certainly an event.
<P></P>
The DM can create as few or as many events as he wishes; the more there are,
the richer his campaign setting will be for it.
