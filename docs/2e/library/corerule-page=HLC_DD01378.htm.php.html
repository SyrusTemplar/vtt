</B>Rogues </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">High-level rogues are masters of wit and misdirection. Although their special
abilities are never more than 95% effective, they receive extra abilities at
21st level. They continue to receive extra proficiencies and hit points until
level 30. In addition, rogues also have access to a host of special skills
beginning at 11th level.

Rogues of 10th level or lower are limited to scores of 95% or less in thieving
skills such as pick pockets and find traps. Once a single skill reaches 95%,
the character must spend discretionary points on other skills. If all the
character’s thieving skill scores are 95%, the discretionary points are lost.
<P></P>
Once a rogue reaches 11th level, however, this limitation is removed, and
there is no limit to how far a character can improve a skill, although any
discretionary points the character lost earlier are not regained. No matter what the
skill score, any roll of 96% or higher is an automatic failure. Any penalties to
the roll, however, are subtracted from the base score.

For example, if Jobare has a find/remove traps score of 120%, he has a 60%
chance to find or remove a magical trap (magical traps reduce the score by half,

Likewise, if Jobare’s open locks score is 100%, he has a 40%
chance to open a masterful lock (which imposes a penalty of –60%, see <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00318.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00318.htm.php.html">Dungeon Master Guide</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>,</I> Table 24).
