Wooden constructions, including most war machines (but not cannons) can be set
ablaze by Greek fire, flaming oil, incendiary missiles, and the like.
<P></P>
Unprotected wood catches fire whenever struck by a fire attack. Wood protected
by wet hides or continual soaking catches fire only on a 1–3 on 1d20. Green or
freshly wet wood catches fire on a roll of 1–11 on 1d20.
<P></P>
The structure takes normal damage from the attack the first round. On the next
round, the attacker rolls 1d20 for each point of damage inflicted in the first
round; on a roll of 10 or more, one additional point is inflicted. If
defenders spend the whole round fighting the fire there is more damage only on a roll
of 15 or more. If no damage is inflicted, the fire goes out. The process is
repeated each round until the construction loses all its structural points or the
fire goes out.
