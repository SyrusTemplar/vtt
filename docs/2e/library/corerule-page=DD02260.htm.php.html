This spell can be used to secure a consecrated area (see the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00660.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00660.htm.php.html">Dungeon Master Guide</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">). The spell seals the area from teleportation, plane shifting, and ethereal
penetration. At the option of the caster, the ward can be locked by a password,
in which case it can be entered only by those speaking the proper words.
Otherwise, the effect on those entering the enchanted area is based on their
alignment, relative to the caster's. The most severe penalty is used.

saving throw).

word locked, cannot enter unless password is known. The attempt does cause
damage if the save is failed.
<P></P>
Once a saving throw is failed, an intruder cannot enter the forbidden area
until the spell ceases. The ward cannot be dispelled by a caster of lesser level
than the one who established it. Intruders who enter by rolling successful
saving throws feel uneasy and tense, despite their success.
<P></P>
In addition to the priest's holy symbol, components include holy water and
rare incenses worth at least 1,000 gp per 60-foot cube. If a password lock is
desired, this also requires the burning of rare incenses worth at least 5,000 gp
per 60-foot cube.
