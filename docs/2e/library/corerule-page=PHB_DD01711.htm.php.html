<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> In general, missile combat is handled identically to standard melee.
Intentions are announced, initiative is rolled, and attack rolls are made. However,
there are some special rules and situations that apply only to missile combat.
<P></P>
Missile weapons are divided into two general categories. The first includes
all standard, direct-fire, single-target missiles--slings, arrows, quarrels,
spears, throwing axes, and the like.
<P></P>
The second category includes all grenade-like missiles that have an area
effect, no matter how small. Thus, an attack with these weapons does not have to hit
its target directly to have a chance of affecting it. Included in this group
are small flasks of oil, acid, poison, holy water, potions, and boulders. Hurled
boulders are included because they bounce and bound along after they hit,
leaving a swath of destruction.
