<B>Specialty:</B> Wanderer.
<P></P>
<B>Qualifications:</B> Whistlers must have a Wisdom of 13 or better. However, qualifying
Intelligence is lowered to 10. Prime requisites for Whistlers are Wisdom and Charisma.
<P></P>
Halflings are the only race able to become Whistlers. They are limited to 15th
level.
<P></P>
<B>Description:</B> Much like dwarven Chanters, halfling Whistlers are the unheralded heroes of
the halfling race. Halflings belong to the general category of nature-sensitive
races and professions. Because halflings hate to kill forest animals for food
or butcher farm pets, they live by using their knack for agriculture.
<P></P>
Their success is largely due to the existence of halfling Whistlers. Although
almost any halfling can whistle up a tune, true Whistlers are extremely rare.
Each halfling community has but one or two.
<P></P>
Whistlers are extremely attuned to the natural environment about them. In
particular, they love forest animals and all types of plant life. The very tunes of
a skilled Whistler can help a garden overcome drought or blight. Whistlers can
also communicate with birds to help prevent insect swarms from wiping out a
village's food supply.
<P></P>
When Whistlers aren't tending gardens and crops, they can be found performing
for the locals. Nearly every day, a comfortable crowd forms in some grassy
section of the community for an evening's entertainment. Some just sit on the grass
and listen to the Whistlers' tunes, while others dance about, laugh, and make
merry.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> Whistlers are an odd mix of a farmer, forest wanderer, and entertainer.
Although they are loved by everyone in the community, most of them seem a bit
reclusive, often living on the edge of town or even in a small burrow just within the
forest's edge. In truth, they aren't reclusive-they are simply maintaining
their unique link with nature.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> Farmer, Forester, Fisher, Leather Worker, Tailor/Weaver, Trapper/Furrier (but
see below).
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Like all halflings, Whistlers love missile weapons, particularly those that
can be thrown. At least half of a Whistler's weapons must be types that can be
hurled.
<P></P>
Whistlers can select from among the following weapons: blowgun, short bow
(either type), club, light crossbow, dagger, dart, footman's mace, hand axe,
harpoon, javelin, knife, quarterstaff, sling, spear, staff sling, short sword, or war
hammer.
<P></P>
In addition to these, Whistlers can take a special weapon proficiency: rock
pitching. All halflings are skilled at pitching rocks, but Whistlers are
especially renowned. A &quot;good&quot; rock can be pitched with the exact same effect as a dart,
except that a Whistler gains a +1 damage bonus if he hits.
<P></P>
Of course, rocks cause blunt damage (not puncture damage as do darts). Only
good rocks that are specially selected by the Whistler gain the above advantage.
If just any old rock is being pitched, damage is reduced to 1 (plus any
Strength adjustment) and long range becomes 3 (not 4). Good rocks have been worn round
in swift rivers. Most rubble, cave rocks, and the broken rocks found in old
dungeons are not good rocks. Whistlers usually carry a supply of 2d4 good rocks
(thrown rocks that hit their targets can be recovered; those that miss are lost).
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonuses:</I> Agriculture, Dancing, Spellcraft, Whistling/Humming. <I>Suggested:</I> Animal Lore, Astrology, Brewing, Cooking, Crowd Working, Direction Sense,
Fire-Building, Fishing, Herbalism, Hunting, Leatherworking, Mountaineering,
Musical Instrument, Poetry, Rope Use, Singing, Set Snares, Survival, Swimming,
Tracking, Weather Sense.
<P></P>
Whistlers generally use fishing, hunting, set snares, and other such skills
for the benefit of nature. They learn these skills so they can scare game away
from sport hunters, spring snares and traps set by greedy furriers, and so on.
Using nature when necessary is acceptable, but it should never be abused. A
Whistler will resort to hunting and fishing only if there is no other way to avoid
starvation.
<P></P>
<B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Whistlers wear only padded armor. They don't like the thought of wearing
leather armor, as some animal had to die for it, and they find other types of armor
too restricting and unnatural.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B>
<P></P>
<I>Influence Reactions:</I> Although Whistlers use a different form of music, namely whistling and
humming, their ability to influence reactions functions exactly like the True Bard's
ability of the same name.
<P></P>
<I>Counter Tune:</I> As noted earlier in the demihuman bard section, halfling demi-bards don't
cast spells. Rather, they gain a special counter spell ability. Whistlers
implement this ability by humming or whistling the proper counter tune. A counter tune
must be whistled to counter a spell that has a verbal component; otherwise, the
counter tune must be hummed.
<P></P>
Counter tune functions just like counter spell in all other ways.
<P></P>
<I>Chattering:</I> Whistling is a wonderful way to express one's mood, but Whistlers take this
form of basic communication a bit further. By &quot;chattering,&quot; a process of
whistling, trilling, and emitting an occasional squeak, Whistlers are able to
communicate. They can carry on complex conversations with other chatterers and are even
able to communicate with some animals.
<P></P>
Whistlers can communicate with any naturally occurring animal that can squeak,
chirp, or whistle. Such communication is on a fundamental level. Basic
information can be exchanged, as well as mood, feelings, etc. For example, a Whistler
could chatter with a squirrel and learn that it has a lot of nuts hidden in a
nearby oak tree. Whistling with a bird might enable the Whistler to learn if it
has seen any large monsters (but not if it has seen five ettin or other
specific information).
<P></P>
Whistlers often find a forest friend that accompanies them on some of their
less dangerous adventures. Ferrets and foxes are particularly fond of adventuring
with Whistlers.
<P></P>
<I>Stormwhistle:</I> The phrase &quot;whistle up a storm&quot; was coined when a ranger once witnessed a
halfling (actually a Whistler) standing out in the middle of a drought-struck
potato field. To the ranger's amazement, the little fellow stuck his hands into his
pockets and starting whistling. Puzzled, the ranger crouched behind a large
birch and watched. An hour later, the sky had clouded over and it started to
rain. After the rain was coming down quite heavily, the ranger glimpsed a
satisfied-looking halfling strolling away.
<P></P>
It is true that halflings can't cast wizard spells. However, Whistlers are
able to cast certain clerical spells. They do not receive these spells like
clerics. In fact, the source of these spells is somewhat of a mystery. Most Whistlers
agree that they are granted by Mother Nature herself.
<P></P>
In any event, Whistlers gain the ability to cast each of the following spells
once per day. The usual components for these spells are ignored; the Whistler
need only whistle to cast the spell. Whistlers gain the following spells at the
listed levels:
<P></P>
1st level:<I> pass without trace</I>
<P></P>
3rd level: <I>obscurement </I>
<P></P>
5th level: <I>plant growth</I>
<P></P>
7th level: <I>speak with plants</I>
<P></P>
9th level: <I>control winds</I>
<P></P>
11th level: <I>weather summoning</I>
<P></P>
13th level: <I>control</I> weather
<P></P>
15th level: <I>entangle</I>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> As with all halfling demi-bards, Whistlers do not gain the bard ability to
cast wizard spells, nor do they gain the 10th-level bard ability to use any
written magical item.
