character with rope use proficiency is familiar with all sorts of knots and can
tie knots that slip, hold tightly, slide slowly, or loosen with a quick tug.
If the character's hands are bound and held with a knot, he can roll a
proficiency check (with a -6 penalty) to escape the bonds.

This character gains a +2 bonus to all attacks made with a lasso. The
character also receives a +10% bonus to all climbing checks made while he is using a
rope, including attempts to belay (secure the end of a climbing rope) companions.
