When this spell is cast, the wizard imbues the chosen object with an enchanted
mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message when a specified event
occurs. The message, which must be of 25 words or less, can be in any language
known by the spellcaster, and can be delivered over a period of one turn. The mouth
cannot speak magical spells or use command words. It does, however, move to
the words articulated--if it is placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue
would actually move and appear to speak. Of course, the magic mouth can be placed
upon a tree, rock, door, or any other object, excluding intelligent members of
the animal or vegetable kingdoms.
<P></P>
The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled, according to the
command of the spellcaster. Some examples are to speak “to the first creature
that touches you,” or “to the first creature that passes within 30 feet.”
Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible
triggers can be used, such as the following: “Speak only when a venerable
female human carrying a sack of groat clusters sits crosslegged within 1 foot.”
Such visual triggers can react to a character using the <I>disguise</I> ability. Command range is 5 yards per level of the wizard, so a 6th-level
wizard can command the magic mouth to speak at a maximum encounter range of 30
yards (&quot;Speak when a winged creature comes within 30 yards.&quot;). The spell lasts
until the speak command can be fulfilled; thus, the spell duration is variable. A
magic mouth cannot distinguish invisible creatures, alignments, level, Hit
Dice, or class, except by external garb. If desired, the effect can be keyed to a
specific noise or spoken word.

The material component of this spell is a small bit of honeycomb.
