In many societies, the practice of magic is considered blasphemous. Ordinary
citizens shun and despise all wizards, considering them to be disciples of
supernatural forces. In extreme cases, those suspected of being wizards are
imprisoned or even executed.
<P></P>
A player character wizard may have been operating secretly in such a society,
fearing the worst if his true skills were revealed. The wizard would welcome
the chance to join a party preparing to embark on any type of adventure, if it
were to take him far away from his homeland. Alternately, a party might encounter
a wizard who was forced to leave home when his skills were discovered by his
countrymen or his family.
