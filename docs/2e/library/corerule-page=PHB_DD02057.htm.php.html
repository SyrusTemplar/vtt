This spell enables the wizard to command 1d6 undead creatures for a short
period of time. Upon casting the spell, the wizard selects one point within range
of the spell. Those undead nearest to this point are affected, until either
undead equal in Hit Dice to the caster's level or six undead are affected. Undead
with 3 Hit Dice or less are automatically controlled. Those of greater Hit Dice
are allowed a saving throw vs. spell, which, if successful, negates the attempt
to control that creature. Regardless of the success or failure of the saving
throw, each creature required to make a check counts toward the Hit Dice limit
of the spell.
<P></P>
Those creatures under the control of the wizard can be commanded by the caster
if they are within hearing range. There is no telepathic communication or
language requirement between the caster and the controlled undead. Even if
communication is impossible, the controlled undead do not attack the spellcaster. At
the end of the spell, the controlled undead revert to their normal behaviors.
Those not mindless will remember the control exerted by the wizard.

The material component for this spell is a small piece each of bone and raw
meat.
