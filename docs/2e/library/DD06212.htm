<B>Invisibility</B>
<P></P>
Wizards should keep in mind that <I>invisibility</I> is an illusion, a condition of artificial reality-- it's not an enchantment
that causes the caster (or creature of the caster's choice) to literally
disappear. As such, <I>invisibility</I> is subject to all of the advantages and limitations of illusionary magic.
Following are the most pertinent points:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The <I>invisible</I> character can always see himself; in effect, he automatically disbelieves the
illusion.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The caster cannot tell with certainty which observers have successfully
disbelieved his illusion of <I>invisibility</I> ; he can only be sure by observing their reactions.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> All objects on the <I>invisible</I> subject's person are also invisible. However, the DM might wish to impose
limitations, since it might not make sense for a 30-foot pole carried by an <I>invisible</I> character to also be entirely <I>invisible</I>. The DM might assume, for instance, that the illusion extends to a 1-foot or
2-foot radius around the affected subject; hence, all objects in contact with
the subject that are within this area are also <I>invisible</I>. If such a limitation is imposed, then an object extending beyond this range
(such as the 30-foot pole) is entirely visible; partially invisible objects
aren't allowed.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Not every creature with fewer than 10 Hit Dice is excluded from noticing an <I>invisible</I> character. Creatures with excellent hearing or those with a sensitive sense
of smell have a chance of detecting an <I>invisible</I> character. The DM should take such heightened senses into account when
determining which creatures are allowed saving throws.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Opponents do not automatically get a chance to detect the presence of an <I>invisible</I> creature. They must first have reason to believe an <I>invisible</I> creature is among them. For instance, a creature might have abruptly
disappeared, or the opponents might hear a mysterious sound or notice footprints in
soft ground. If one opponent successfully sees an <I>invisible</I> creature, he can alert his companions to the creature's presence, at which
time they are allowed saving throws to detect the creatures if they haven't made
such throws already. (For more about the limits of illusions, see the &quot;<A HREF="DD06219.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD06219.htm">More About Adjudicating Illusions</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot; section that follows. )

<B>Misdirection</B>
<P></P>
This spell can be used to misdirect the results of non-weapon proficiencies
that impart knowledge. Examples of non-weapon proficiencies affected by <I>misdirection</I> include Ancient History, Animal Lore, Appraising, Astrology, Direction Sense,
and Herbalism. If the subject of misdirection fails his saving throw, he
receives incorrect information from the use of his proficiency. For instance, <I>misdirected</I> Animal Lore will convince the subject that a vicious creature is harmless,
while <I>misdirected</I> Appraising will convince him that a valuable gem is worthless.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Web</B>
<P></P>
This spell can be used as a makeshift net to prevent damage to falling
characters, assuming there are suitable projections or surfaces available to anchor
the web. A <I>web</I> of at least 5 feet of thickness protects a falling character from damage
regardless of the height from which he falls
