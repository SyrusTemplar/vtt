<P></P>
<B>Description:</B> This priest was a member of a noble family and entered a priesthood. But even
as a priest he keeps his opinions about the superiority of the ruling classes
and his tastes for the finer things in life; he doesn't abandon his love of
good food, good furnishings, comfort, the arts, intellectual stimulation, and so
forth.
<P></P>
The Nobleman Priest prefers the company of nobles and is often appointed as an
advisor to a noble family, a ruler, an important local governor, etc. He has
less concern for the lives and welfare of commoners. When pressed, he will
perform any and all priestly duties for commoners, but he usually seeks to avoid
these duties; when he is a low-level character, he'll keep himself away from
common folk as much as possible in order to avoid these inconveniences, and when he
is higher-level he will assign a subordinate or a follower to attend their
needs.
<P></P>
The Nobleman Priest is not necessarily evil or a bad person. In fact, he often
adheres to a code of chivalric behavior much like a knight's. But he does have
strong social prejudices which color his thinking.
<P></P>
Important note: A nobleman can become a priest and not take the Nobleman
Priest kit. This sort of priest lives more frugally, like other priests, and does
not have to have a disdain for the lower social classes; Nobleman Priests do not
count him among their ranks.
<P></P>
There are no special requirements to be a Nobleman Priest.
<P></P>
If a Nobleman Priest player-character ever decides that he is wrong in his
attitudes (which can occur in especially dramatic fashion if he is affected by the
self-sacrifice of a commoner who has saved him, or if he falls in love with a
character of the common social classes), he may choose to abandon this kit. If
he does this, he will be ostracized by most of the nobles who were previously
counted as his friends (the DM can have one or two more broad-minded nobles
still count him a friend, and the player-characters can make up their own minds on
the subject); he may even be exiled from his own family. As with any kit
abandonment, he loses all other benefits and hindrances of the kit.
<P></P>
<B>Barred:</B> None.
<P></P>
<B>Role</B>: In the campaign, the Nobleman Priest is an aggravating snob (though he might
not be aware of his snobbery). He is a fun role to play, but he'd better have
some redeeming features if the other PCs are to continue to associate with him.
If he does have redeeming features, it's very likely that some PCs will try to
&quot;reform&quot; him to their own way of thinking.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> Nobleman Priests may choose or random-roll their Secondary Skill.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Required: None. Recommended: Long sword, bastard sword, lance, flails (all),
maces (all), if allowed by the priest's actual priest class.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Bonus Proficiencies: (General) Etiquette, Heraldry, Riding (Land-Based).
Recommended: (General) Animal Training, Dancing, (Warrior, double slots unless the
priest class has a nonweapon proficiency group crossover including the Warrior
group) Gaming, Hunting, (Priest) Local History, Musical Instrument,
Reading/Writing.
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> The Nobleman Priest may spend his gold as he chooses # but he has certain
minimum standards he cannot violate. Before starting play, he must buy:
<P></P>
(1) A suit of armor (if he is permitted to by his priest-class . . . and,
unless his class limits him to lesser armor, he cannot buy armor less protective
than brigandine or scale mail).
<P></P>
(2) At least one weapon larger than a dagger (again, if his priest-class so
permits him).
<P></P>
(3) A horse (at least a riding horse), riding saddle, bit &amp; bridle, horseshoes
and shoeing, halter and saddle blanket.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> The Nobleman Priest starts with more gold than other priests; see below under
Wealth Options.
<P></P>
The Nobleman Priest receives a +3 reaction from any noble of his own culture,
and a +2 from nobles of other cultures. The DM can ignore this if there is a
cultural hatred between those people and the priest's culture or the priest's god.
<P></P>
When travelling, he can demand shelter from anyone in his own land; he can
demand shelter for two people multiplied by the priest's experience level (if he's
eighth level, he can demand shelter for himself and a retinue of fifteen more
people).
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> The Nobleman Priest is expected to live well. If he has enough money to do
so, he may only buy high-quality goods, and so must spend at least two times the
minimum necessary money for anything he buys. If a basic long sword costs 15
gp, he won't buy one worth less than 30 gp; the extra money goes into quality,
engraving, etc. (He can't save money by having a friend or follower buy cheaper
things for him; he's just not satisfied with anything less than good-quality
merchandise.)
<P></P>
If the priest is broke and cannot spend this extra money, he can then settle
for lesser goods . . . but the other nobles of his culture, if they see him
with shabby accoutrements, will mock him, and he does not get his reaction bonus
until once again all his goods are high-quality goods. In fact, if his gear and
possessions look sufficiently shabby (DM's discretion), people may not believe
him to be a nobleman at all, and may refuse him the shelter he could ordinarily
demand. (This happens most often if a nobleman priest is robbed of all his
clothes and goods and left to fend for himself.)
<P></P>
As he can demand shelter of others, other Nobleman Priests can demand shelter
of him. This can be expensive if they decide to stay for awhile. This is also a
good way for the DM to bleed extra money from the priest if he seems to have
too much.
<P></P>
<B>Wealth Options:</B> The Nobleman Priest begins play with more gold than other priests. He gets
225 gp plus the standard 3d6x10 gp. But he must spend a good portion of that on
the Equipment required of him. If the priest abandons this kit, that money
doesn't magically &quot;go away,&quot; but as part of his social ostracization the character
should suffer some sort of financial loss, equal to at least 225 gp, as
determined by the DM. (Perhaps a malicious ex-friend destroys some of his property;
perhaps a petty-minded business acquaintance betrays him on a business deal.)
<P></P>
<B>Races:</B> This kit has no special requirements for race. The DM may decide that not all
races have the same kind of social snobbery that humans do, in which case that
race could not take this kit.
