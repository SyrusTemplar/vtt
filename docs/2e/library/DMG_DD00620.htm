If the optional definition of infravision is used, the DM has set a precedent
for using scientific laws to explain the ability. Some people, arguing that
there are visual organs that can apparently see into the infrared spectrum (using
infravision), will also argue for other forms of sight able to see into other
ranges of the spectrum. These can be included, if the DM desires. However,
before adding these to his game, the DM had best have a firm grasp of the rules and,
maybe, of physics.
<P></P>
For example, just what would a character or creature with ultravision (the
ability to see into the ultraviolet spectrum) see? Our eyes see objects because of
visible light that is <I>reflected</I> off objects (except for a few objects, such as the sun, light bulbs, fires,
etc., that emit enough visible light for us to see them). Infravision utilizes
heat (infrared) energy <I>emitted</I> by objects, since almost everything emits infrared energy. The problem with
infravision is that many objects, such as normal weapons and rocks, without
internal heat sources, are at or very near the temperature of their surrounding and
thus are nearly indistinguishable from those surroundings when using
infravision. Ultravision (and vision utilizing x-rays, gamma rays, or radio waves) is
useless since only stars and a few other celestial objects emit significant
amounts of energy in these regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. All wold appear
uniformly black with these forms of vision, except for a few objects in the sky.
