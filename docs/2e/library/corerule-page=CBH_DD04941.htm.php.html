All of these books contain much information that can enhance your bard. Some
of the more useful information is listed below.
<P></P>
<B>The Complete Fighter's Handbook:</B> The &quot;Character Creation&quot; section provides an in-depth look into the armorer
proficiency. Those bard kits able to wear non-standard armor will find this
topic particularly interesting. Weapon quality and its effects on combat are also
discussed. The &quot;Role-Playing&quot; section provides a list of warrior personalities,
some of which could be adopted by bard characters. Since some bards are adept
with numerous weapons, the section on combat rules applies to certain bards
(particularly the expanded weapon proficiency rules, which allow a character to
learn multiple weapons while expending only a few proficiency slots). Fighting
styles, martial arts, and other odd combat rules are also presented here. Even
jousting tournaments are covered (ideal for the Gallant kit). Within the
&quot;Equipment&quot; section is a sizable collection of new weapons, new armor, and new magical
items.
<P></P>
<B>The Complete Thief's Handbook:</B> As you might expect, this handbook has a great deal of useful information for
the bard class. Within are more useful rules than can be listed here. However,
general topics you may find helpful include the following: role-playing
thieves, new proficiencies, guilds (construction, maintenance, and types), thief
tools, thief equipment, new magical items, classic cons (especially good for the
Charlatan), new thief rules, and a description of the thief-based campaign.
<P></P>
<B>The Complete Priest's Handbook:</B> There is little information in this handbook that is pertinent to the bard
character class.
<P></P>
<B>The Complete Wizard's Handbook:</B> Chapter 4 discusses campaign worlds with varying levels of magic. Chapter 5
covers wizards and combat. Chapter 6 describes spell casting under water, spell
functioning on various planes, and impaired casting. Chapter 7 presents a
commentary on new applications for old spells, adjudicating illusions, spell
research, and magical item research. Chapter 8 gives all-new spells ranging from 1st
to 8th level. Finally, Chapter 9 contains a number of useful wizardly lists.
<P></P>
<B>The Complete Psionics Handbook:</B> There are two useful elements within this book. Most important are the wild
talents in Chapter 1. It is possible for a bard to have a few wild psionic
talents (the process for determining this is given in Chapter 1). If a wild talent
is discovered, the bard player will find the rest of this book invaluable, as it
contains all the information needed to run a psionically endowed bard. Also,
note that all player character Gypsy-bards are wild talents. The psionics book
also contains a number of challenging psionic monsters.
