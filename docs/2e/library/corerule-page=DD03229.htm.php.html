<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Rejuvenation:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> This proficiency allows a psionicist to recover PSPs more quickly than is
usual by entering a rejuvenating trance. This state of deep concentration requires
a successful proficiency check. For every hour a hero maintains this trance
(and makes the check), he regains PSPs at twice the usual rate (one-quarter of
his total instead of one-eighth). He canâ€™t expend PSPs while in this trance, and
his state is much like deep sleep.
