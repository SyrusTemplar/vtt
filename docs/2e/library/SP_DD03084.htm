<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Tumbling:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Characters with this proficiency can roll, somersault, stand on their hands,
flip forward and backward, and otherwise perform feats of acrobatics. They can
only perform tumbling feats if unencumbered or lightly encumbered.
<P></P>
Tumbling characters can improve their AC by 4 on a given round if: they
avoiding attacks directed against them, win initiative, and elect not to attack that
round. A tumbling character can move up to 20 feet, or remain in one place,
during the course of this evasion. In unarmed combat a character with tumbling
ability improves attack rolls by +2.
<P></P>
The character can attempt to dodge through obstacles or escape through narrow
apertures, but successful proficiency checks are required. If the character
topples from a height of 60 feet or less, a successful proficiency check results
in suffering only half damage from the fall.
