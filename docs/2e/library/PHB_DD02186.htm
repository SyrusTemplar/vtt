This spell enables the priest to meld his body and possessions into a single
block of stone. The stone must be large enough to accommodate his body in all
three dimensions. When the casting is complete, the priest and not more than 100
pounds of nonliving gear merge with the stone. If either condition is violated,
the spell fails and is wasted.
<P></P>
While in the stone, the priest remains in contact, however tenuous, with the
face of the stone through which he melded. The priest remains aware of the
passage of time. Nothing that goes on outside the stone can be seen or heard,
however. Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm the priest, but its partial
destruction, if enough so that the caster no longer fits, expels the priest
with 4d8 points of damage. The stone's destruction expels the priest and slays
him instantly, unless he rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell.
<P></P>
The magic lasts for 1d8+8 rounds, with the variable part of the duration
rolled secretly by the DM. At any time before the duration expires, the priest can
step out of the stone through the stone surface he entered. If the duration runs
out, or the effect is dispelled before the priest exits the stone, he is
violently expelled and suffers 4d8 points of damage.
<P></P>
The following spells harm the priest if cast upon the stone that he is
occupying: <I>stone to flesh</I> expels the priest and inflicts 4d8 points of damage; <I>stone shape</I> causes 4d4 points of damage, but does not expel the priest; <I>transmute rock to mud</I> expels and slays him instantly unless he rolls a successful saving throw vs.
spell; and <I>passwall</I> expels the priest without damage.
