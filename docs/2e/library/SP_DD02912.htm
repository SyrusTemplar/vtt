</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Flinds are warlike humanoids with many of the worst traits of hyenas and
similar scavengers. They are covered with mangy brown or reddish-brown fur, with
bestial muzzles and long, muscular limbs. Flinds are closely related to <A HREF="MM_DD03923.htm#daf13be9"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="MM_DD03923.htm#daf13be9">gnolls</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, but are stronger, smarter, and more fierce than their cousins. Gnolls look
upon flinds as leaders, heroes, and champions.

Unlike the chaotic pack-like society of most gnolls, flind society tends to be
organized and less savage. Flinds are quick to resort to violence, just like
gnolls, but unlike their lesser cousins they?re much more likely to consider the
consequences and risks first, and then carefully plan their attack.
