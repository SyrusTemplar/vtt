Miscast magic</I> can be cast only on a wizard. It causes the next spell cast by the affected
wizard to be chosen randomly from his memorized spells of the same or lower
level. Thus, if a wizard affected by <I>miscast magic</I> had four 1st-level spells memorized ( <I>armor, feather fall, jump</I>, and <I>sleep</I>) and he attempted to cast the sleep spell, the DM would determine the
resulting spell randomly from the wizard's four memorized spells. The wizard has only
a 25% chance of casting the <I>sleep</I> spell.
<P></P>
Only spells currently memorized are eligible to be exchanged with the desired
spell. If a wizard had only one spell memorized, the <I>miscast magic</I> would have no effect and the wizard's spell would be cast normally.
<P></P>
The miscast spell operates normally. If a wizard tried to <I>levitate</I> a companion but a <I>web</I> spell resulted, the companion would be trapped by the webs and subject to all
resulting effects. If the target of the spell were in range of the <I>levitate</I> spell but not in range of the <I>web</I>, the spell would be lost in a fizzle of energy and the <I>web</I> spell would be wiped from the caster's memory.
<P></P>
The wizard who casts the spell performs the proper verbal and somatic
components of the spell he wishes to cast; he does not discover the altered results
until the wrong spell takes effect. The wizard will also discover that the
material component for the resulting spell has vanished (in addition to the material
component for the desired spell).
<P></P>
Wizards who are targets of <I>miscast magic</I> are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect.
