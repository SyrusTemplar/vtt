When a <I>mirror image</I> spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes from two to eight exact duplicates
of himself to come into being around him. These images do exactly what the
wizard does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is
cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and
which is the actual wizard. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack,
magical or otherwise, it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact
until struck. The images seem to shift from round to round, so that if the
actual wizard is struck during one round, he cannot be picked out from among his
images the next. To determine the number of images that appear, roll 1d4 and add
1 for every three levels of experience the wizard has achieved, to a maximum
of eight images. At the end of the spell duration, all surviving images wink out.
