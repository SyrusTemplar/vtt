  <B>Description: </B>The Giant Killer is a skilled combatant, often from humble beginnings, trained
to the specific purpose of slaying giants. He has mastered combat techniques
designed to fell giants, and has become an expert in their behavior and habits.
A Giant Killer is nothing if not confident; a giant's immense size merely means
he makes a good target.
<P></P>
   For the purposes of this kit, giants include true giants, such as: cloud
giants, fire giants, frost giants, hill giants, stone giants, and storm giants. Also
included are giant-kin, such as cyclops, ettins, firbolg, fomorians, verbeeg,
and voadkyn. The DM may augment this list with other giants relevant to his
particular campaign.
<P></P>
   <B>Requirements:</B> A Giant Killer must have a minimum score of 15 in both Strength and Dexterity.
<P></P>
   <B>Primary Terrain:</B> Any terrain is acceptable, so long as some type of giant calls it home.
<P></P>
   <B>Role:</B> Giant Killers have keen minds, strong bodies, and unshakable egos. Most Giant
Killers tirelessly promote their own skills and accomplishments, boasting of
their latest triumphs to anyone who'll listen. Not surprisingly, their
reputations precede them in most civilized regions. However, reactions among residents
vary. For every person who reveres the Giant Killer as a hero, there's another
who dismisses him as a blowhard. But when giants plague a community, everyone
welcomes a Giant Killer with open arms.
<P></P>
   Even when their services are desperately needed, Giant Killers rarely exploit
their position. Most charge only modest fees, or settle for a medal or other
token of appreciation in lieu of payment. As often as not, Giant Killers seek no
remuneration of any kind, fighting giants for the sheer pleasure of it.
<P></P>
   Unsurprisingly, the mere promise of an encounter with a giant is reason enough
for most Giant Killers to join an adventuring party. For the most part, a
Giant Killer leaves decision-making to others. Though in principle, he may share
the party's fervor for the expedition at hand, he's usually more concerned with
finding giants. He may become impatient and surly if the party goes for too long
without meeting one.
<P></P>
  The Giant Killer relishes violent encounters of all kinds, if only to exercise
his combat skills. Of course, he comes into his own when fighting giants, and
it's a wise party that follows his lead in such situations.
<P></P>
   <B>Secondary Skills: </B>Bowyer/Fletcher, Forester, Groom, Hunter, Tailor, Weaponsmith.
<P></P>
   <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Because the Giant Killer faces tall adversaries, he must become proficient
with missiles and hurled weapons. The first weapon slot, and every odd slot
(third, fifth, and so on), must be a missile weapon: bow (any), crossbow (any),
sling, staff sling, or any melee weapon that can be hurled. The even-numbered slots
may be filled with any weapons of the Giant Killer's choice.
<P></P>
   <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Giant Killers pursue their interest in giants with such single-mindedness
that they have little time left to master other skills. Therefore, a Giant Killer
is allowed only one nonweapon proficiency at first level. This must be selected
from the following: Bowyer/Fletcher, Cobbler, Cooking, Hunting, Pottery,
Riding (Land-based), Running, Tailor, Swimming, Weaving.
<P></P>
   <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Giant Killers have no special equipment requirements. They often carry
shields decorated with medals and ribbons awarded them from grateful communities for
slaying troublesome giants. Though such shields can be used normally, they're
mainly for show; Giant Killers generally put them aside before engaging a giant
in battle.
<P></P>
   <B>Species Enemy:</B> None; however, see Special Bonuses against giants.
<P></P>
   <B>Followers:</B> Normal (but see optional rule).
<P></P>
   <B>Special Benefits:
<P></P>
</B>   <I>Attack Bonuses:</I> A Giant Killer has all the following bonuses when attacking giants:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Giant Killers inflict bonus damage against giants, +1 point of damage for
every level of the Giant Killer. </B>For example, if a 7th level Giant Killer makes a successful attack with a
spear, the giant suffers 1-8 points of damage from the spear, plus 7 for the Giant
Killer's level.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Giants have a base -4 to hit when attacking Giant Killers. </B>A giant with a THAC0 of 10 needs a 14 to hit a Giant Killer with AC 0.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Giant Killers can dodge giant attacks. </B>If a giant with initiative attacks and hits, the Giant Killer may give up his
action to dodge. If the Giant Killer saves vs. death magic, the giant's attack
misses. If the Giant Killer has initiative, he can dodge instead of attacking
for the round.
<P></P>
   <I>Infuriate:</I> A Giant Killer can goad a giant into making careless and ill-conceived
attacks. To infuriate a giant, the Giant Killer spends two rounds darting between the
giant's legs, waving his hands, and hollering insults. The Giant Killer cannot
make attacks or take any other actions while attempting to infuriate the
giant; if interrupted (to dodge, for example), he must start over. During this time,
the giant can attack the Giant Killer; however, because of the Giant Killer's
erratic movement, the giant's attacks are made at an additional -2 penalty.
<P></P>
   At the end of this period, the giant makes a saving throw vs. spells. If the
throw succeeds, nothing special happens. If the throw fails, the giant becomes
enraged for the next 2-12 (2d6) rounds. During that time, the giant directs all
of his attacks against the Giant Killer; the giant's attacks are made at an
additional -4 penalty. The Giant Killer may attack normally while the giant is
infuriated.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Optional Rule:</B> Follower Infuriation
<P></P>
   A Giant Killer may enhance his chances of infuriating a giant by using an
animal follower that has been trained to infuriate. The follower, which must be a
bird or other flying creature of small size (S), learns this trick in accordance
to the Training Followers rules in Chapter 3. The trick counts against the
follower's normal limit of tricks and tasks. Only a Giant Killer can train a
follower to infuriate.
<P></P>
   While the Giant Killer is executing his infuriating routine, the follower may
also infuriate the giant by swooping around his head and screeching. The
giant's saving throw against the infuriation is reduced by a -2 penalty for the
infuriating follower. This effect is not cumulative with additional followers. An
infuriated giant might direct its attacks at the infuriating follower in addition
to the Giant Killer. If the giant tries to attack an infuriating follower, the
follower successfully dodges the blow unless the attack roll is a 19 or 20. A
follower can't attempt to infuriate alone. A follower can only augment the
infuriating attempts of the Giant Killer.
<P></P>
<I>Giant Lore:</I> If a Giant Killer discovers a footprint, lair, campsite, or any other
physical evidence of a giant, a successful Wisdom roll enables him to learn some
general information about the giant in question. Such information may include the
giant's type, approximate size, and companions. He may also learn how recently
the giant was in the area and in what direction the giant traveled. The DM
decides the quality and amount of information the Giant Killer receives.
<P></P>
   <B>Special Hindrances:
<P></P>
</B>   <I>Tracking Limitation: </I>Unlike other rangers, the tracking ability of the Giant Killer is limited to
tracking giants. A Giant Killer who selects a general Tracking proficiency can
track other creatures as non-ranger character.
<P></P>
   Because Giant Killers seldom make an effort to conceal their identities,
they're often singled out for harassment. Insecure villagers may challenge Giant
Killers to duels to impress their friends, or bullies may ambush Giant Killers to
demonstrate their toughness.
<P></P>
   To avenge the death of a companion, some giants may target Giant Killers for
assassination. Giant tribes occasionally offer bounties for proof of a Giant
Killer's death, making the Giant Killer a prime candidate for attacks.
