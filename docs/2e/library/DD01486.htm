All priests must live by certain tenets and beliefs. These guide the priests'
behavior. Clerics generally try to avoid shedding blood and try to aid their
community. A war deity may order its priests to be at the forefront of battles
and to actively crusade against all enemies. A harvest deity may want its priests
to be active in the fields. The ethos may also dictate what alignment the
priest must be. The nature of the mythos helps define the strictures the priest
must follow.
