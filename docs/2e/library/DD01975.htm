The <I>airy water</I> spell turns normal liquid, such as water or water-based solutions, into a
less dense, breathable substance. Thus, if the wizard wanted to enter an
underwater place, he would step into the water, cast the spell, and sink downward in a
globe of bubbling water. He and any companions in the spell's area of effect can
move freely and breathe just as if the bubbling water were air. The globe is
centered on and moves with the caster. Water-breathing creatures avoid a sphere
(or hemisphere) of airy water, although intelligent ones can enter it if they
are able to move by means other than swimming. No water-breathers can breathe in
an area affected by this spell. There is only one word that needs to be spoken
to actuate the magic; thus, it can be cast under water. The spell does not
filter or remove solid particles of matter.

The material component of the spell is a small handful of alkaline or bromine
salts.
