Currently, the different schools of wizard magic are merely sketched out and
very lightly defined. The different schools can be used as described, but they
lack detail and, in a few cases, a full range of spells. There are, for example,
very few necromantic spells, thus discouraging player characters from being
necromancer specialists. There is nothing wrong in this--nothing requires schools
of magic to be equal. However, you might want to customize and expand the
schools of magic to suit your campaign.
