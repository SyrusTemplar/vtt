When this spell is cast, the temperature surrounding the caster can be altered
by 10 F., either upward or downward, per level of experience of the
spellcaster. Thus, a 10th-level caster could raise or lower the surrounding temperature
from 1 to 100 degrees. The spell can be used to ensure the comfort of the
caster and those with him in extreme weather conditions. The party could stand about
in shirt sleeves during the worst blizzard (although it would be raining on
them) or make ice for their drinks during a scorching heat wave.
<P></P>
The spell also provides protection from intense normal and magical attacks. If
the extreme of temperature is beyond what could be affected by the spell (a
searing blast of a fireball or the icy chill of a white dragon), the spell
reduces the damage caused by 5 points for every level of the caster. Normal saving
throws are still allowed, and the reduction is taken after the saving throw is
made or failed. Once struck by such an attack, the spell immediately collapses.
<P></P>
The material component for this spell is a strip of willow bark (to lower
temperatures) or raspberry leaves (to raise temperatures).
