<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Wild Talents</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> A wild talent is a hero from any character class other than the psionicist
class who has natural psionic potential. This potential can be present in any
character, regardless of class, alignment, or race. The alignment restrictions of
the psionicist class don’t apply to wild talents.
<P></P>
Wild talents have one or two psionic powers, up to three psionic defenses, and
up to three psionic attacks at their disposal once they’ve reached full power.
The psionic defenses come naturally, one at a time, according to the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03222.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03222.htm.php.html">Psionic Progression table</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
Psionic attacks are only gained after the PC places the contact proficiency in
an available nonweapon proficiency slot. A wild talent chooses one of the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03197.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03197.htm.php.html">five attack forms</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> at that time. He may select a second and a third attack form when slots
become available according to his group proficiency progression (as outlined in the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01523.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01523.htm.php.html">Player’s Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">).

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Testing for wild talents involves risk. The test must be performed when a
character is created, when a character’s Wisdom score increases, when psionics are
introduced into a campaign, or the first time a character receives psychic
surgery.
<P></P>
Every character and monster has a base chance of 1% to be a wild talent. This
is modified as follows:
