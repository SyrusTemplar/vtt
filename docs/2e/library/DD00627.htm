One advantage of careful timekeeping is the detail and flavor it adds to the
DM's campaign. If a calendar is kept, the DM has a way of recording the passing
seasons, holidays, months, cycles of the moon, or other details that give a
world life.
<P></P>
Clerics have holy days to observe, werewolves become more prevalent near full
moons, snows come, and birds fly south. All of these are events that happen
during the course of a year and make a world seem more real. Without some type of
calendar, the DM has nothing to base his campaign on. Take, for example, the
following exchange between players:
<P></P>
Jon (Johan the Cleric's player): &quot;Say, you know I'm a member of this temple.
Do I have to do anything, or what? Do I give a sermon every week or are there
some days of fasting or anything?&quot;
<P></P>
DM: &quot;Well, uh, yeah—you've got holy days you're supposed to spend in prayer.&quot;
<P></P>
Jon: &quot;Oh, when?&quot;
<P></P>
DM (in desperation): &quot;Well, uh—Thanksgiving's coming.&quot;
<P></P>
Jon: &quot;Oh, but you said it's the middle of summer. Doesn't Thanksgiving come at
harvest time?&quot;
<P></P>
Louise (chiming in): &quot;You know, it's been summer ever since my character
started playing.&quot;
<P></P>
DM: &quot;Well—it's magic!&quot;
<P></P>
Not exactly a lot of color planning there. Now, if the DM had worked out a
calendar, he could have answered those questions with a lot more confidence.
<P></P>
Preparing a calendar does take time. The easiest method is to buy a small
pocket calendar for the current year. Start the campaign on the same date as the
first adventure. Thus, if the first game is played on April 3rd, the campaign
starts on that day. The real calendar and game calendar will get out of sync
quickly, but at least there will be a record of seasons, moons, and important dates.
<P></P>
This is a good starting point, but a modern calendar is not the same as that
used in medieval times and certainly not the same as one used for a fantasy
world. You'll want to customize your calendar with details from your game world.
So, what types of details should be included?
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>The Basics</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">have to be determined. Aside from recording the length of years, months, and
weeks (which can be anything the DM decides), the calendar should also name
them. You can use real names or you can be quite fanciful (the Winter of the Broken
Moon or the Moon of Popping Trees, and go on). Have fun.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Physical Cycles</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">can be worked out. When do the seasons fall? When are the phases of the moon?
When do the equinoxes and solstices occur? Strange and magical events often
happen at these times.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Religious Observances</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">should be added. All major player character religions should be assigned holy
days, so that player character priests will have something to observe. There
are normally a lot of these, and they will vary from region to region.
<P></P>
Medieval calendars observed over 100 different holy days for saints or special
events. Create your own such calendar, being sure to add special observances
particular to each kingdom, empire, or region. These might include the king's
birthday, the date of a titanic victory over the infidel, the opening of a market
fair in a nearby city, or the annual harvest festival.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fantastic Events</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">are clearly an important part of a fantasy world's calendar. These can be
anything imaginable—the annual visitation of a ghostly castle, the bi-monthly
tribute demanded by the evil wizard, the night-march of mysterious nomads, or the
seasonal migration of the wyverns.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Special Events</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">should be included, as well. The local princess may have an impending wedding.
The army may prepare for the annual campaign against the orc hordes. The death
of an important official may require a set period of mourning. All of these
can be used to fill up a calendar.
<P></P>
Clearly, setting up a detailed calendar takes planning and time. Events must
be created and assigned to specific dates. Furthermore, the DM must have some
idea of what happens during each event, preferably something that makes it
different from all others.
<P></P>
What happens when the evil wizard comes to collect his tribute? (All the
townsfolk shutter their houses and hide from his vile horde.) When the king posts
the bans for his daughter's nuptials? (A largess of 1 cp is granted all the poor
of the city.) During the Festival of Antherra? (Shrines are paraded through the
streets and there is much merriment.) The answers created by the DM supply the
ultimate detail needed to make a campaign come alive.
