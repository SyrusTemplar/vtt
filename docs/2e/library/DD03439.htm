Paladins, Rangers, and Minor Spellcasters </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Minor spellcasters include those characters whose primary abilities lie in
other areas-paladins, rangers, and any other characters who gain minor magical
abilities at higher levels. For these characters, spells are only a small part of
their repertoire of abilities, often acquired late in their adventuring careers.
<P></P>
In many campaigns, the magical powers of minor spellcasters tend to be
ignored. Since they have to wait longer than the wizards and priests of a campaign to
gain their spell powers, minor spellcasters only have access to spells that
their enemies can easily counter. When a 10th-level paladin can cure 20 points of
damage by <I>laying on hands</I>, his <I>cure light wounds </I>seems insignificant, and his <I>bless </I>spell only takes his adjusted THAC0 from a 5 or so to a 4. The opponents that
an 11th-level ranger is likely to be facing will have an easy time making their
saves against an <I>entangle </I>spell. The spell powers of minor spellcasters are far more important to a
character operating alone or looking for spells that support or enhance his
abilities.
