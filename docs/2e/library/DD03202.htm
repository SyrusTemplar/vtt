</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Like a terrible mental weight, this attack seeks to crush a defender’s mind.
For every 8 PSPs put into the attack (declared after a successful attack roll is
made), the attacker rolls 1d10 to determine psionic damage against his foe. If
hit, the defender loses that many PSPs or has his mind opened to further
psionic contact if no PSPs remain. A failed attack costs 4 PSPs. Psychic crush has a
range of 50 yards.
<P></P>
If used against an open mind, psychic crush causes 1d6 points of physical
damage (hit point loss) for every 8 PSPs put into the attack. Although no psionic
defenses remain, the attacker must roll the defender’s MAC to successfully hit
(with a +2 bonus to the attack roll).
