<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Mystic </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Thoughtful and introspective, the mystic seeks to find the answers to the
mysteries of the universe by traveling across the globe. Nonviolent by nature, the
inquisitive mystic seeks only truth, and he avoids confrontations when
possible. However, if the mystic must battle his way to enlightenment, he will do so.
Mystics are usually found among cultures that place a high value on art,
philosophy, and scholarship. As seekers of knowledge, mystics often become
adventurers while they search for the answers they seek.

society. Roll 2d6 to determine the rank of a mystic.

to thieves and bards. Only characters of the following races can choose this
kit: human, elf, half-elf, gnome, halfling, aarakocra, alaghi, centaur,
githzerai, swanmay, and wemic.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Mystics can wield any weapons appropriate to their classes. However, most
prefer lighter weapons which do not weigh them down.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended nonweapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Astrology, astronomy, religion, etiquette, languages (modern or ancient),
history, (local or ancient), reading/writing, heraldry, riding (any), herbalism,
healing, gem cutting, musical instrument, navigation.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Equipment:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Mystics can select whatever equipment they desire and can afford. However,
these characters are known to travel unencumbered, so care should be taken in
what they purchase and acquire.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended traits:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Artistic ability, empathy, obscure knowledge, ancient history, precise memory.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Benefits: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A mystic can temporarily boost one of his 12 subability scores by +2. If the
mystic is a ranger with a 16 Balance score, by meditating the score can be
temporarily increased to an 18. If the mystic is a warrior trying to boost a Muscle
score of 18/30, the bonus counts as 20% rather than 2 points-each point equates
to 10%. The mystic warrior-s Muscle is temporarily increased to 18/50. To gain
this subability bonus, the mystic must meditate, building up his body and mind
for this feat. The subability score remains boosted for one-third of the
mystic-s meditation time. If the Mystic mediated for three uninterrupted hours, he
could boost a subability score for one hour.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hindrances:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The process of meditation requires effort. While a mystic could meditate in
the cabin of a ship, he could not do so if that ship were in the midst of a
terrible storm. Attacks or very loud noises also disrupt meditation. The time spent
in meditation does not alleviate the mystic-s need for food and sleep. So it
is unlikely that a mystic could spend three days in meditation in preparation
for an adventure. Further, a mystic cannot gain multiple meditation bonuses at
one time.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wealth:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A mystic is interested in knowledge, not material items. As such, he cannot
own more than he can carry. A mount is an exception, as such a beast is useful
in taking the mystic to new places.
