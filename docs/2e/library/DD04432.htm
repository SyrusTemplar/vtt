<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Aroma of Dreams:</B> All creatures who come within 5' of the wearer of this oil are put to sleep.
Potential victims are allowed a saving throw vs. spell. If successful, the
victim suffers no effect and may remain near the wearer without need of further
saving throws. If the roll is failed, the creature slumps to the ground, the
victim of a magical slumber that lasts 1d4+4 rounds.
<P></P>
When an application of the oil is worn, the scent is potent for 3d4 rounds.
After this time, the perfume evaporates and another dose must be applied if the
wearer wishes to renew the effect.
