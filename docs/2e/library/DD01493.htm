<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A druid makes most saving throws as a priest, but he gains a bonus of +2 to
all saving throws vs. fire or electrical attacks.
<P></P>
All druids can speak a secret language in addition to any other tongues they
know. (If the optional proficiency rules are used, this language does not use a
proficiency slot.) The vocabulary of this druidic language is limited to
dealing with nature and natural events. Druids jealously guard this language; it is
the one infallible method they have of recognizing each other.
<P></P>
Additional powers are granted as the druid reaches higher levels:
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>He can identify plants, animals, and pure water </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">with perfect accuracy after he reaches 3rd level.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>He can pass through overgrown areas </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">(thick thorn bushes, tangled vines, briar patches, etc.) without leaving a
trail and at his normal movement rate after he reaches 3rd level.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>He can learn the languages of woodland creatures. </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">These include centaurs, dryads, elves, fauns, gnomes, dragons, giants, lizard
men, manticores, nixies, pixies, sprites, and treants. The druid can add one
language at 3rd level and one more every time he advances a level above 3rd. (If
the optional proficiency rules are used, it is the druid's choice whether or
not to spend a proficiency slot on one or more of these languages.)
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>He is immune to <I>charm</I> spells cast by woodland creatures </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">(dryads, nixies, etc.) after he reaches 7th level.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>He gains the ability to shapechange </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">into a reptile, bird, or mammal up to three times per day after he reaches 7th
level. Each animal form (reptile, bird, or mammal) can be used only once per
day. The size can vary from that of a bullfrog or small bird to as large as a
black bear. Upon assuming a new form, the druid heals 10-60% (1d6 Ã— 10%) of all
damage he has suffered (round fractions down). The druid can only assume the
form of a normal (real world) animal in its normal proportions, but by doing so he
takes on all of that creature's characteristics -- its movement rate and
abilities, its Armor Class, number of attacks, and damage per attack.
<P></P>
Thus, a druid could change into a wren to fly across a river, transform into a
black bear on the opposite side and attack the orcs gathered there, and
finally change into a snake to escape into the bushes before more orcs arrive.
<P></P>
The druid's clothing and one item held in each hand also become part of the
new body; these reappear when the druid resumes his normal shape. The items
cannot be used while the druid is in animal form.
