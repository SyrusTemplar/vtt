This spell enables the caster to cause a pool of normal water found in a
natural setting to act as a scrying device. The pool can be of no greater diameter
than 2 feet per level of the caster. The effect is to create a scrying device
similar to a <I>crystal ball.</I> The scrying can extend only to the Ethereal Plane and the Inner Planes (which
includes the paraelemental planes, the Demiplane of Shadow, etc.). General
notes on scrying, detection by the subject, and penalties for attempting to scry
beyond the caster's own plane are given in the DMG, as well as a description of

The following spells can be cast through a reflecting pool, with a 5% per
level chance for operating correctly: <I>detect magic, detect snares and pits,</I> and <I>detect poison.</I> Each additional detection attempt requires a round of concentration,
regardless of success. Infravision, if available, operates normally through the
reflecting pool.

The image is nearly always hazy enough to prevent the reading of script of any
type.

The material component is the oil extracted from such nuts as the hickory and
the walnut, refined, and dropped in three measures upon the surface of the
pool. (A measure need be no more than a single ounce of oil.)
<P></P>
At the DM's option, the casting of this spell may be limited to once per day.
