<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Acrobat</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3"> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">An acrobat is a general term for performers of amazing physical feats. These
include jugglers, tumblers, jesters, and tightrope-walkers. Whatever their
specialty, these characters make a living by entertaining others. Acrobats often
travel in groups or with circuses or carnivals. These shows wander from town to
town and castle to castle. All levels of society wish to be entertained. As such,
successful acrobats find themselves in much demand.
<P></P>
A life on the road is not an easy one, however, and many acrobats often turn
to other avenues to make money. Their dexterous skills make them valuable
adventurers, especially if some larceny or petty theft is involved.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Social ranks:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Acrobats most often occupy the middle tier of a society. Most lower-ranked
members of a society have not the time to develop skills, like those of the
acrobat. They must concentrate on putting food on the table. Roll 2d6 to determine
an acrobat?s social rank at the campaign?s beginning.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Small, light weapons are preferred by acrobats, as bulky or heavy ones would
hinder their agile maneuvers. Suggested weapons include the knife, dagger,
short sword, club, and hand axe. Thrown weapons and those with long hafts or
handles also are common choices among acrobats, as the weapons can be used to juggle
or pole-vault. These weapons include: quarterstaff, dart, javelin, and spear.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended nonweapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Disguise, juggling, jumping, musical instrument, tightrope-walking, and
tumbling.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Equipment:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Acrobats prefer to be lightly armed and armored to allow for the fullest
range of movement.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended traits:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Ambidexterity, double-jointed, glibness.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Benefits:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> If unarmored, acrobats receive a +2 bonus to tumbling, tightrope-walking, and
jumping proficiency checks. In addition, they gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class
versus hurled missile weapons?provided they have room to dodge the attack and
are not otherwise prevented from moving freely.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hindrances:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Any acrobat who wears armor heavier than studded leather (AC 7) suffers a ?1
penalty to tumbling, tightrope-walking, and jumping proficiency checks per
point of armor class better than AC 7. For example, an acrobat wearing chain
mail?AC5?suffers a ?2 penalty. Note that Dexterity or magical bonuses to Armor Class
do not increase this penalty. An acrobat wearing studded leather armor, a <I>ring of protection +2</I>, and having a 15 Dexterity would incur no penalty despite his AC 4 rating.

class.
