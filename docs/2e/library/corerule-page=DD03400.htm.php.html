Specialists in Schools of Effect
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The schools of effect are organized along different lines than the schools of
philosophy. This alternate approach to magic and specialization means that
elementalists and other effect specialists donâ€™t necessarily enjoy the same
benefits and penalties of philosophical specialists. These exceptions are explained
below in the descriptions of the individual specialist wizards.
<P></P>
Just like the schools of philosophy, specialization in a school of effect
generally requires a wizard to meet higher ability score criteria than that
required of a basic mage (see <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03399.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03399.htm.php.html">Table 2</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> : Effect Specialist Requirements).
