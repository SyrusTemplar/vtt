Monstrous Spellcasters
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Monsters who memorize and expend spells in the same fashion as player
characters fall into this category. A monster that has a character level equivalent,
such as a 19th-level lich or a 10th-level vampire mage, is a monstrous
spellcaster. In general, monstrous spellcasters must abide by the same rules and
restrictions of human and demihuman wizards and priests; monstrous wizards may not wear
armor (although many monsters have a natural Armor Class to compensate),
monstrous priests and mages may be restricted in choice of weapons, monstrous
spellcasters must be able to use verbal, somatic, or material components required by
the spell, and they can be interrupted by damage or other distractions during
spellcasting.
<P></P>
There are several types of monstrous spellcasters, including humanoids,
undead, extraplanar creatures, and (for lack of any better word) nonhumanoids. Most
monsters have an effective casting level equal to their spell ability, so a
cloud giant with the spell ability of a 4th-level priest casts spells as if he were
4th level, while a ki-rin with the spell ability of an 18th-level mage casts
spells as an 18th-level wizard. A few rare monsters, such as dragons or kenku,
have the ability to use spells of a certain level but aren?t wizards or priests
with levels. Unless otherwise noted, these monsters have a casting level equal
to their Hit Dice.
<P></P>
<B>Humanoids: </B>This category includes living monsters that are generally bipedal or humanoid
in form, ranging from bullywugs or lycanthropes to githyanki or giants. In many
cases, spellcasters are quite rare among their race; only 1 in 10 cloud giants
has the ability to use wizard spells, for instance. The Monstrous Manual? tome
and <I>The Complete Book of Humanoids </I>describe dozens of races that have the ability to produce priests or wizards.
<P></P>
<B>Undead: </B>Human or demihuman spellcasters who retain their magical abilities after death
fall into this category. The principle examples are liches and vampires. In
both cases, the character?s class and level are retained through the
transformation into undeath.
<P></P>
<B>Extraplanar: </B>A small number of extradimensional or extraplanar monsters have magical
abilities. Some aasimon and yugoloths fall into this category, but creatures that are
or formerly were mortal (githyanki, githzerai, tieflings, or einheriar) are
considered to be humanoid spellcasters instead. Most extraplanar creatures also
command a formidable array of spell-like abilities in addition to their
memorized spells.
<P></P>
Creatures of this sort do not need spell books or extended periods of study to
learn their spells; after a good rest, or a period of concentration or prayer,
extraplanar spellcasters may choose their spells just as a mortal spellcaster
would select spells from a book or pray for spells from his patron deity. The
actual spell memorization only requires 1 to 3 turns, but the creature?s resting
time or other preparations consume several hours at the minimum. In any event,
spells may be memorized no more than once per day.
<P></P>
Extraplanar creatures with wizard spell ability are still limited in their
total number of spells known?in effect, they carry their ?spell books? in their
own memory, and merely select which ones will be available during the course of a
day. Creatures with priest spell ability are assumed have access to the same
spheres available to a standard cleric.
<P></P>
<B>Nonhumanoids: </B>This broad category includes all other creatures who memorize and expend their
spells. Couatl, dragons, lammasu, nagas, and sphinxes are just a few examples
of nonhumanoid spellcasters. Generally, nonhumanoid spellcasters follow the
same guidelines described under extraplanar spellcasters: they do not need spell
books and simply recall their spells once per day. In addition, nonhumanoid
spells have verbal components only; no somatic or material components are required,
since creatures such as nagas or couatl develop variations on standard spells
that do not require hands to cast.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Monstrous Specialists: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Most monsters with spell ability are assumed to be mages or clerics. However,
specialist wizards and specialty priests are not unheard of. First of all,
humanoids from races familiar with magic, such as githyanki or githzerai, could
quite easily be specialist wizards. Similarly, shamans are common among all kinds
of barbarians, and goblin or bugbear shamans are reasonable.
<P></P>
Undead spellcasters could be specialist wizards or specialty priests of any
variety, since they gained their magical powers during their lifetimes. On the
other hand, extraplanar and nonhumanoid specialists would be fairly unusual,
simply because these creatures have a wide array of powers to begin with. Some
might be appropriate?a red dragon elemental fire specialist, an arcanaloth
dimensionalist, or a planetar with druidic powers are all possible, if rare.
