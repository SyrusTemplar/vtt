High-level AD&amp;D? campaigns pose some special problems for the referee.
Encounters are more difficult to construct because the DM cannot simply throw monsters
at characters whose prowess are equal to those of Hercules, Merlin, and other
heroes of myth and legend. Keeping a high-level campaign on-track and exciting
can be so difficult that many players and DMs prefer to retire their high-level
characters and start over at 1st level rather than continue the campaign.
<P></P>
Retiring powerful characters and starting over is not an unreasonable course
of action. Indeed, Chapter Three of the <A HREF="DMG_DD00244.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00244.htm">Dungeon Master? Guide</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> explains that retirement is inevitable once characters exceed level 20. If
you are reading this, however, you?ve decided to forge ahead and experience what
truly powerful AD&amp;D characters can do.
<P></P>
The book you hold in your hands contains rules and campaign suggestions for
characters of up to 30th level. For our purposes, any character of level 10 or
more is high-level.
<P></P>
It is possible to have a successful high-level campaign, but only if the
participants are willing to put forth extra effort to build a game that works. This
chapter presents seven basic principles that anyone who runs a high-level
campaign should understand:
<P></P>
<P></P>
Don?t depend on the dice.
<P></P>
Use adversaries intelligently and inventively.
<P></P>
Control magic.
<P></P>
Be aware of demographics.
<P></P>
Think on an epic scale.
<P></P>
Plan ahead.
<P></P>
Share responsibility with your players.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Following these principles does not guarantee a great game, but all successful
high-level AD&amp;D campaigns use them to one degree or another. If you
<P></P>
keep these maxims firmly in mind, your campaign can continue to provide you
and your players with many hours of enjoyment even after the player characters
have achieved fantastic levels of power.
