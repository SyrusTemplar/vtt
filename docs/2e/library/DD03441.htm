Rangers gain the ability to cast priest spells at 8th level. They have access
to the spheres of plant and animal. Like paladins, rangers don?t gain bonus
spells for high Wisdom scores and may not use clerical magical items. At 8th
level, the ranger casts spells with the effectiveness of a 1st-level priest; for
each level past 8th, the ranger?s casting level increases by one, to a maximum of
9th level for a 16th-level ranger. (See <A HREF="PHB_DD01467.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01467.htm">Table 18</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Ranger Abilities in the <I>PHB</I>.)
<P></P>
Like paladins, rangers may use armor with no restrictions while casting
spells. However, the ranger should have at least one hand free to present his holy
symbol or other material components, so a character might have to put down or
drop a shield or second weapon in order to cast a spell.

Optional Spell Abilities for Rangers</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The ranger?s spell powers can be customized, just like those of any other
class. Some of the options available include the following:
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Alternate sphere access (5+): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Normally, rangers have minor access to the spheres of plant and animal,
totalling 10 CPs. A ranger may choose to have minor access to any combination of
alternate spheres totalling 10 CPs or less. For example, a ranger might choose
travelers, elemental air, and healing. If spheres are exchanged on a
point-for-point basis, this optional ability has a base cost of only 5 CPs, but a ranger may
choose extra spheres of access and add the costs listed in <A HREF="DD03430.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03430.htm">Table 6</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Access Costs.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Increased spell power (7): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A ranger with this power casts spells with an effective casting level only
four levels less than his true level and has no maximum casting level. Normally,
an 8th-level ranger casts spells as a 1st-level priest, but with this ability
the ranger has a casting level of 4 instead of 1. Spell progression is
unaffected; only level-based characteristics of a spell are affected by this ability.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Increased spell progression (7/12): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A ranger with this power gains his spell ability earlier than 8th level. For 7
points, he begins to gain spells at 6th level; for 12 points, he begins to
gain spells at 4th level. In all other respects, his spell powers are unchanged,
and he simply enters the <A HREF="DD03510.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03510.htm">Table 18</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> at the level indicated. Each level he gains from that point on advances him
one level on the chart.

Optional Restrictions for Rangers
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Ranger class-design options are discussed in detail in the <I>Player?s Option: <A HREF="SP_DD02935.htm"></A></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="SP_DD02935.htm">Skills &amp; Powers</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>book. The abilities above are simply added to the slate of available powers
for ranger characters.
<P></P>
If you wish to use these abilities without the <I>Skills &amp; Powers </I>rules, you can assign the ranger an experience point penalty of 30% plus 1%
per point spent. If a ranger chooses access to two additional spheres totalling 8
points, his total penalty would be 30% + 13%, or 43%. If the DM awards 2,000
experience points for an adventure, the ranger would gain 860 less than normal,
only collecting 1,140 experience points. This experience penalty will counter
some of the character?s unusual advantages.
