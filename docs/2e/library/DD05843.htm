<P></P>
</B>
<P></P>
There are two quite specific ways in which a thief will be expected to supply
his seniors within the guild with information. First, information concerning
his own plans; second, general information possibly of value to guild members.
<P></P>
A thief will be expected to keep the guild informed about important ventures
he has planned. This does not include dungeon-bashing, wilderness adventures,
and the like! Rather, robberies and break-ins which may net particularly good
rewards or strike at &quot;sensitive&quot; targets (such as a temple, or the warehouse of a
notable merchant), particularly nefarious crimes such as kidnapping, and major
scams are examples of crimes which a thief will always be expected to notify
the guild seniors or guildmaster of. Many guilds will insist that such major
crimes can only be committed with the guildmaster's permission. This is especially
likely to be true with a strong guild, and in a lawful or repressive society
where such actions may stir up a hornet's nest of trouble for the guild.
<P></P>
Feeding back general information to the guild will also keep a thief in good
standing with his fellows. A thief casing a joint for a later break-in might see
an unusual number of guards around in the courtyard of an adjacent building as
some crates are being taken inside from a wagon, and one crate splits slightly
at the top revealing the glint of gold or ivory in the bright sun . . . The
thief knows that he cannot organize a robbery over there as well as in the place
he's casing already, so he reports the pleasant view to the guild. Doing so
will certainly keep the thief in good favor. The thief will be expected to
provide such information should he come across it, but the guildmaster might well
reward particularly helpful guild members, mark them for promotion, give them a
sinecure role in some other guild job, pay a small percentage of the guild take
to the helpful informant, and the like.
<P></P>
<I> Snitches: </I>These can be of special importance to a thieves' guild. Basically, a snitch is
someone paid to provide &quot;inside information.&quot; A snitch can be a corrupt
officer of the law, a valet or servant of a rich man (or at a club of some kind), a
nightwatchman, and so on.
<P></P>
A few guilds might insist that only the very senior guild members can have
their own snitches; juniors must turn over promising contacts who could be
developed into snitches to the guild. More likely, though, is that individual members
can have their own snitches who are regarded as sacrosanct by other guild
members. A guildsman does not tamper with another thief's pet snitch! This is
obviously going to be easiest if the identities of the snitches are actually commonly
known within the guild?how can you not poach a snitch if you don't know who is
one, after all? But, because some thieves may be very nervous about this, the
identity of certain really important snitches may be kept secret. The guild
will protect them by warning thieves away from the key snitches indirectly (e.g.,
with an edict that no one is to try to &quot;make friends&quot; with the staff of
such-and-such an establishment). This does not make the identity of the snitch known,
but serves to warn other thieves away.
