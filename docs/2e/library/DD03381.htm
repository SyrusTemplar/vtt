Schools of Philosophy</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The eight standard schools of spells presented in the <A HREF="PHB_DD01648.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01648.htm">Player’s Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> —abjuration, alteration, conjuration/summoning, enchantment/charm, greater
divination, illusion/phantasm, invocation/evocation, and necromancy—are schools
of philosophy. While all spells in this scheme of organization are cast in much
the same way, the approach and method by which they achieve their purpose
varies from school to school. For example, conjuration spells generally bring
something to the caster from another location, while necromancy spells manipulate the
forces of life and death.

While spells in a school of philosophy generally involve the application of a
common principle, they vary greatly in effect. For example, invocations create
anything from solid matter such as <I>walls of stone </I>or <I>iron </I>to comprehensive enchantments such as <I>contingency </I>or <I>limited wish</I>. Note that all spells grouped into schools of philosophy share the same
execution or method of casting—the use of verbal, somatic, and material components
to summon and direct magical energy. The basic philosophies behind each school
are briefly described below:

<B>Abjuration </B>spells are specialized protective spells designed to banish some magical or
nonmagical effect or creature. <I>Protection from evil </I>is an example of an abjuration spell, since it creates a barrier that evil or
supernatural creatures are reluctant to cross.

<B>Alteration </B>spells cause a change in the properties of some previously existing thing,
creature, or condition. <I>Pyrotechnics </I>is an alteration spell, since it takes an existing fire and creates special
effects from the blaze.

<A NAME="2f5f68d7"></A><A NAME="2f5f68d7"></A>

<B>Conjuration/Summoning </B>spells bring some intact item or creature to the caster from elsewhere. Any <I>monster summoning </I>spell is a good example.

<A NAME="f2177172"></A><A NAME="f2177172"></A>
<P></P>
<B>Enchantment/Charm </B>spells cause a change in the quality of an item or the attitude of a person or
creature. <I>Charm person </I>is an enchantment, since it affects the way an individual perceives the wizard.

<P></P>
<B>Divinations </B>are spells that provide the wizard with information or the ability to acquire
information.<I> Contact other plane </I>is a divination, since it allows the wizard to seek answers from extraplanar
entities. Note that this school has been somewhat altered in scope for this
book; see <A HREF="DD03384.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03384.htm">The School of Universal Magic.</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">

<P></P>
<B>Illusion/Phantasm </B>spells seek to deceive the minds or senses of others with false or
semi-substantial images and effects. <I>Phantasmal force </I>is a good example, as well as spells such as <I>mirror image, invisibility, </I>or <I>blur</I>.
<P></P>
<A NAME="aa591aa8"></A><A NAME="aa591aa8"></A>

<B>Invocation/Evocation </B>spells channel magical energy to create specific effects and materials. For
example,<I> lightning bolt </I>manifests this energy in the form of a powerful stream of electricity.

<A NAME="88a642dc"></A><A NAME="88a642dc"></A>
<P></P>
<B>Necromancy</B> is a school concerned with the manipulation of the forces of life and death.
Necromancy spells include those that simulate the effects of undead creatures,
such as <I>vampiric touch</I>, and more direct assaults on life energy like <I>death spell </I>or <I>finger of death</I>.

<B>Universal Magic: </B>In this book, the school of lesser divination is expanded and renamed to
include a number of spells that all wizards should have access to. Consider
universal magic to be Sorcery 101; without the basic spells in this school, wizards are
incapable of continuing their studies in the other schools of magic.
Therefore, all wizards have access to the spells in this school, regardless of
specialization. The school of universal magic is described in more detail below.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Creating a New School of Philosophy: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">In most campaigns, the schools of philosophy represent the baseline or
standard against which other forms of magic are measured. Almost all spells can be
described through this system of magic, with very few exceptions. For a wizard to
develop a new school of philosophy, he would have to devise a class of spells
that all share a common approach or methodology. Most likely, a group of related
spells that already exist in one school or another would have to be used as
the starting point for a new school. It’s much easier to build a new school of
effect or thaumaturgy than to build a new school of philosophy. <I>The Complete Wizard’s Handbook </I>suggests a school of transmutation that concentrates on spells that change one
element or material into one other element or material. Another possibility
might be a school of animation, centering on spells that provide motive force to
inanimate objects.
