<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">These weapons are more refined versions of bombards. They have long, slim
barrels made from high-quality bronze and they fire wrought-iron shot in a low,
flat trajectory. They are fairly accurate.
<P></P>
Cannons are subject to misfires just as bombards are. A shot from a light
cannon requires 10 charges of <I>smoke powder </I>or gunpowder. A medium cannon requires 15 charges, and a heavy cannon requires
20 charges.
<P></P>
A light or medium cannon can change facing 45 degrees during the End-of-Round
step of any round when it fires. A full crew working nonstop can change a heavy
cannon’s facing in 15 minutes.
<P></P>
The sound of cannon fire can panic some creatures just as a bombard’s can.
