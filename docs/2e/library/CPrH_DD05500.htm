Many priesthoods require their priests to use only a certain category of
weapons. Some only restrict them <I>from</I> using a certain narrow category of weapons. Some require their priests to use
no weapons at all. Commonly, a god identified with a certain type of weapon
will require his priests to use that weapon and a certain number of similar or
related weapons.
<P></P>
The DM should assign the priesthood a weapons restriction based on two choices.
<P></P>
First, weapons restrictions reinforce the special attributes and character of
the worshipped god; limiting priests of the god of Death to sickle-like weapons
certainly establishes flavor for them.
<P></P>
Second, weapons restrictions, like armor restrictions, help define the combat
roles of priests in the campaign. If a priest is limited to daggers and
creampuffs, he's not going to be the campaign's combat monster, so magic and his
priestly duties will be much more important to the character.
<P></P>
Many examples of this are given in the next chapter, &quot;Sample Priesthoods.&quot;
