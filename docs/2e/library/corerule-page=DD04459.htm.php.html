<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Amulet of Far Reaching:</B> When willed by the caster, this amulet increases the range of 1st-level
spells by 30%, 2nd-level spells by 20%, and 3rd-and 4th-level spells by 10%.
Fractions of one-half and greater are rounded up; all others are rounded down.
<P></P>
The amulet affects only range and does not alter a spell's area of effect. The
amulet cannot affect spells with ranges of 0 or touch.
<P></P>
A maximum of 1d10+4 spell levels can be affected by the amulet each day. Each
amulet has its own individual limit, secretly determined when it is found.
