<P></P>
<B>Specialty:</B> Assassin/Spy/Weapon Master.
<P></P>
<B>Qualifications:</B> Blades must have a Dexterity of 13 or more, an Intelligence of at least 13,
and a Charisma of 15 or more.
<P></P>
<B>Introduction:</B> <I>So you want to know about Blades, eh? Well, keep out of the way and I can show
you about myself and those like me. My name's Dark and I'm a Blade. I take my
name from the black garb that I wear at all times. I'm actually not exceptional
in this, as all Blades dress in dark clothing. But the name has stuck, and I
like it.
<P></P>
I currently work for a small carnival that travels around the mid-Flanaess,
entertaining the local crowds and thrilling the women. My tricks are similar to
those of most Blades. I perform sword dances, swallow sabers, put on weapon
displays, and perform feats of knife throwing. Most crowds are especially
enthralled when I strap Tatanna, a young-looking elf maiden, to a wooden plank,
blindfold myself, step back 12 paces, then encircle her body in a wall of knives.
<P></P>
Entertaining fools is only my surface career. On the last day of a
performance, a half dozen of my fellow performers and I stage the real entertainment-at
least from my point of view. We slip into the upper class section of town and
relieve some pompous wealthy dupe of his family fortune.
<P></P>
Although these &quot;side shows&quot; are very profitable, they still don't give me the
old thrill that I used to get. Thus, I've turned to a more daring
hobby-assassination. I'm not a &quot;Blade for hire,&quot; and I absolutely hate those mindless,
ruthless killers. What I do is feel out a town to discover who's oppressing the
populace the most. Once I've found the biggest bully in town, I slip into his
residence, spy on him, and plan his untimely demise. Then I perform my greatest solo
act. I slip into the fellow's bedroom, poison him, cast </I>sound bubble<I>, wake him, and then share in his last few moments of life.
<P></P>
</I> <B>Description:</B> Blades are master artisans with bladed weapons. Everyone has seen a Blade in
action at fairs and carnivals. They are the knife throwers who pop balloons
while blindfolded and swallow slender sabers such as those used by lawless pirates
on the high seas.
<P></P>
Blades also perform amazing displays of weapon skill and control as they flash
various weapons all about their bodies with deadly precision. Oriental Blades
are perhaps the most skilled at this particular art form. Using weapons such as
the three-piece rod, nunchaku, or the katana, Oriental Blades put on amazing
displays of rapid weapon movement, including offensive and defensive spins,
katas, and ritual dances. Occidental Blades are also impressive, as they rapidly
spin short swords, quarterstaves, or sickles about them.
<P></P>
Besides rapid displays of weapon skill, Blades also perform slow, elegant
dances, involving incredibly precise movement and timing. These dances include
thrusts, lunges, leaps, graceful arcs, etc.
<P></P>
If there is a showy way to wield, throw, or perform with a weapon, a Blade
knows how to do it better than anyone.
<P></P>
<B>Role: </B>Blades have great reputations as the most deadly weapon masters in the land.
This is generally far from the truth. Any warrior is more skilled than most
Blades at successfully attacking opponents. Blades don't understand offensive and
defensive weapon maneuvers, nor do they know the locations of vital body parts.
Blades can be effective in many combat situations, however, as they use flash
and flare to enhance their attacks.
<P></P>
Imagine what an orc would think if it was trapped in a cavern with only two
exits and a man blocking each. One man (a warrior) wears plate mail and is calmly
holding a long sword; the other (a Blade) is dressed in solid black studded
leather armor and is grasping a halberd. Both men advance upon the hapless orc,
but the Blade begins rotating his halberd in an ever-quickening offensive spin,
demonstrating masterful control of his weapon. Which opponent will the orc
choose?
<P></P>
Blades are valuable aids to any party, as their amazing displays can have
significant effects upon the resolve and morale of opponents.
<P></P>
For every Blade who leads an adventurous life, there is another who serves in
the role of assassin. Blades make perfect killers, as they know how to climb
walls, cast wizard spells, and use any weapon they choose. Furthermore, Blades
can use their performing personae to gather information and even get themselves
invited to perform within the homes of their victims.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> Armorer, Bowyer/Fletcher, Gambler, Weaponsmith.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> At least half of a Blade's weapon proficiency slots must be selected from the
following: sword (any), dagger, knife. Blades are also limited to expending
but one slot on a purely missile weapon (one that cannot be used in melee
combat). This does not include such weapons as spears or hand axes, which can be
thrown or used in melee.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonuses:</I> Reading/Writing (native tongue), Local History, Blind-fighting, Juggling. <I>Suggested:</I> Blacksmithing, Bowyer/Fletcher, Disguise, Poetry, Weaponsmithing.
<P></P>
<B>Armor/Equipment:</B> To complement their entertainment image as mysterious and fearsome men,
Blades often dress in black garb, even going so far as to wear masks, facial wraps,
or black headgear. Their weapons are always kept in perfect condition and
highly polished for maximum effect during a performance. A man dressed in solid
black, flashing gleaming silver blades, is truly an awesome sight.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B>
<P></P>
<I>Weapons Display:</I> For this ability to have an effect, the Blade must whirl a non-missile weapon
about his body. The observer must be close enough to the Blade to see the
display (<I>e.g.,</I> a <I>darkness</I> spell negates the effect). The display has no effect upon those already
engaged in close combat, as they are too busy to pay attention to the show. Also,
Weapons Display works only on those of Low (5) or better Intelligence, who can
either use weapons or have seen them used. (It is impossible to impress green
slime by twirling a dagger in your fingers.) Likewise, a highly intelligent
creature that has never seen a weapon used will also be unintimidated by the Blade's
display.
<P></P>
By whirling a melee or hurled weapon about, a Blade can affect the morale and
courage of others. Such a display of skill, precision, and deadly grace lowers
opponents' morale by 2 (but it does not require an immediate morale check) and
inspires allies, giving a +1 bonus to allies' attack rolls.
<P></P>
The display must occur for a full round without interruption. During this
time, any successful attack upon the Blade, or failed saving throw by the Blade,
disrupts the display.
<P></P>
Weapons Display may be used only once per encounter; the display lasts for one
round per level of the Blade.
<P></P>
This ability requires a lot of room; it cannot be done in a narrow corridor.
Specifically, the Blade must be able to stand with his arms extended while
holding out the weapon and be able to move his arms in all directions without
contacting any obstructions.
<P></P>
<I>Handle Weapon:</I> Blades train and perform with weapons in both hands. Although all thieves are
allowed to attack with two weapons (see Chapter 9 of the <I>PHB</I>), Blades suffer no penalty to their main weapon and only a -2 penalty to the
attack roll with their secondary weapon.
<P></P>
Blades are considered to be ambidextrous. They can shoot a bow equally well
with either their left or right hand, they can wield a sword in either hand, and
they can throw daggers with either hand-all with no penalties.
<P></P>
When a Blade tries to catch small weapons that are thrown at him, the attack
roll (see the juggling proficiency) is made using the Blade's level as a bonus.
<P></P>
<I>Trick Throw:</I> Although this ability is called &quot;trick throw,&quot; it functions the same for both
missile weapons and hurled weapons. Trick throw enables a Blade to perform
called shots (as per Chapter 9 in the <A HREF="DMG_DD00421.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00421.htm">DMG</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). The usual -4 attack roll penalty is lessened by 1 for every five experience
levels of the Blade (round fractions up). Thus 1st- through 5th-level Blades
suffer only a -3 penalty, 6th- through 10th-level Blades suffer only a -2
penalty, and so on.
<P></P>
Because Blades throw weapons blindfolded, they extend the blind-fighting
proficiency to include hurled weapons and missile weapons (to a maximum range of 30
feet).
<P></P>
<I>Defensive/Offensive Spin:</I> Defensive and offensive spins are elements of a good weapon display. They
have other uses as well.
<P></P>
A defensive spin is a specialized form of parrying (<A HREF="PHB_DD01721.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01721.htm">see Chapter 9 of the PHB</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> ) in which the Blade whirls his weapon to create a deadly shell about his
body. A Blade may not attack during any round in which he is performing a
defensive spin. The Blade's Armor Class is lowered by half the Blade's level (round
fractions up) during this maneuver. In addition, any creature that makes a melee
attack on the Blade must roll a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation or
suffer damage equal to half the Blade's level (round fractions up; the damage is
limited to the weapon's maximum damage, including any bonuses of the weapon). A
defensive spin may be used only once per combat; it lasts for a maximum number
of rounds equal to the Blade's Constitution. A successful hit upon the Blade
disrupts his concentration and ends the defensive spin.
<P></P>
An offensive spin is a much more threatening maneuver. The Blade creates a
fearsome-looking display of skill directed at a specific opponent. The spin must
last for the entire round, during which the Blade does not attack (nor does he
receive any Armor Class adjustment, as he would for a defensive spin). On the
next round, the Blade makes a normal attack roll. If this hits, the victim must
roll a successful morale check or it will try to stay at least ten feet from the
Blade (going off to attack other members of the Blade's party or fleeing in
terror if the Blade is the only available opponent). Offensive spins may be
attempted only once on a particular creature. Furthermore, the Blade cannot have
been damaged by that creature prior to the offensive spin attack (a creature won't
fear someone it has already injured). This is a difficult condition to
fulfill, as the creature gets a free round to attack while the Blade is the first
round of the offensive spin. Offensive spins function only against creatures of Low
(5) or better Intelligence.
<P></P>
If the Blade's spin is interrupted (either voluntarily or by a successful
attack), the Blade does not get an attack that round.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> Unlike many other bards, Blades do not gain the 10th-level ability to use all
forms of written magical items. Blades study weapons, not scrolls, maps, and
books.
<P></P>
<B>Notes:</B> Although Blades do not receive a single bonus to damage or attack rolls, and
they fight as rogues, they are still some of the flashiest combatants you'll
ever meet or play.
