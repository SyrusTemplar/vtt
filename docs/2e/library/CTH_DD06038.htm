A thief can attempt to knock out a victim under certain circumstances by
striking from behind with a blunt instrument. In order to be eligible for a mugging
attack, a target must be eligible for a <I>backstab,</I> as explained in <A HREF="PHB_DD01505.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01505.htm">Chapter Three</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>. In addition to all restrictions governing a backstab, a thief cannot mug a
victim more than twice as tall as the thief.
<P></P>
The eligible thief character simply makes a mugging attack instead of a normal
backstab. The thief gains his +4 backstab bonus and the victim loses shield
and Dexterity bonuses. If helmets are detailed in the campaign, the victim has AC
10 unless the head is protected.
<P></P>
If the thief scores a hit, the victim must make a saving throw versus
petrification or fall unconscious for 2d8 rounds. Modify the saving throw by the
difference in level or hit dice between the mugger and the victim.
<P></P>
For example, Pwill the thief (T9) sneaks up behind the ogre sentry (4 HD).
Pwill's blow is successful, so the ogre saves as a level 4 warrior. Normally he
would save on a 12 or better, but the difference in Pwill's level (9) and the
ogre's HD (4) modifies his necessary save to 17. However, the DM rolls a 19 for
the ogre, so Pwill's attempt only makes the sentry mad. And loud.
