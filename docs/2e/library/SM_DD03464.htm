</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Omen Reading: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">There are hundreds of myths and superstitions about the art of divination, or
predicting the future through the reading of signs or indications. A character
with this proficiency is skilled in a form of divination and knows the proper
ceremonies and observances to use in order to obtain a valid reading. He is also
familiar with the various messages or indications that characterize a form of
divination. Omen readers use dozens of different methods for their auguries,
including astrology, numerology, reading palms, examining animal entrails,
casting bones, dice, or runes, and burning incense to observe the smoke, just to name
a few. The exact nature of the character?s expertise is up to the player.
<P></P>
To use this proficiency, the omen reader phrases a general question about a
course of action, such as ?Is this a good day to start our journey?,? ?Should we
try to track the orcs to their lair, or wait for their next raid?,? or ?When
will the dragon return?? The DM then makes a proficiency check in secret; if the
character fails, the DM can tell him that the signs were inconclusive, or make
up a false answer for a spectacular failure (a natural 20 on the check, for
instance). If the omen reader succeeds, the DM can give the character a vague
answer based on his assessment of the situation. An omen is usually good, bad, or
inconclusive, although an answer of ?a day or two? or ?proceed, but with
caution? is acceptable as well. Omens aren?t guaranteed; if a party ignores a bad
omen, they might succeed in their task anyway. An omen is nothing more than the
DM?s best guess about a course of action.

Performing the ceremony of reading an omen requires an hour or more. Special
tools or supplies, such as runesticks, may be necessary depending on the
character?s favored form of omen reading. Some superstitious or primitive cultures may
place a great deal of weight on omen reading, and a skilled diviner may be
held in high regard by these people.
