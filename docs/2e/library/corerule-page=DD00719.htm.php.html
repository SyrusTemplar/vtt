<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Gaseous Form:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">By imbibing this magical liquid, the individual causes his body, as well as
anything he's carrying or wearing, to become gaseous. The gaseous form is able to
flow at a base speed of 3/round. (A <I>gust of wind</I> spell, or even normal strong air currents, will blow the gaseous form at air
speed.)
<P></P>
The gaseous form is transparent and insubstantial. It wavers and shifts, and
can't be harmed except by magical fire or lightning, which do normal damage. A
whirlwind inflicts double damage upon a creature in gaseous form. When in such
condition the individual is able to enter any space that is not airtightâ€”even a
small crack or hole that allows air to penetrate also allows entry by a
creature in gaseous form. The entire potion must be consumed to achieve this result,
and the effects last the entire duration (4+1d4 turns).
