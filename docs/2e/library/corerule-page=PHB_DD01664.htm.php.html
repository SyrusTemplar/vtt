<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Armor Class (AC)
<P></P>
</B>is the protective rating of a type of armor. In some circumstances, AC is
modified by the amount of protection gained or lost because of the character's
situation. For instance, crouching behind a boulder improves a character's Armor
Class, while being attacked from behind worsens his AC.
<P></P>
Armor provides protection by reducing the chance that a character is attacked
successfully (and suffers damage). Armor does not absorb damage, it prevents
it. A fighter in full plate mail may be a slow-moving target, but penetrating his
armor to cause any damage is no small task.
<P></P>
Armor Class is measured on a scale from 10, the worst (no armor), to -10, the
best (very powerful magical armors). <I>The lower the number, the more effective the armor.</I> Shields can also improve the AC of a character (see “<A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01631.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01631.htm.php.html">Shields</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">” in Chapter 6: Money and Equipment).
<P></P>
Abilities and situations can also affect a character's Armor Class. High
Dexterity gives a bonus to Armor Class, for example. But even a character with a
Dexterity bonus can have this bonus negated if he is attacked from the rear.
