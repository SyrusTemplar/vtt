Overland movement is much more affected by terrain than single-round movement.
Thus, a wide variety of terrain types slow or, on very rare occasions,
increases the character's rate of movement.
<P></P>
Overland movement is measured in miles. It is possible for characters to cross
several different types of terrain in a single day. To say that characters
must take the worst terrain modifier for all movement is ridiculous. Imagine
telling players they have to travel at the mountain movement rate when they are
crossing the plains just because they spent their first hour in the mountains!
<P></P>
Furthermore, in round movement the DM can see where a character will be at the
end of the round and what terrain he had to cross to get there. In overland
movement, it is very hard to predict all the different terrain types characters
will enter during the course of a day.

movement spent per mile of travel through that terrain type. When a character or
creature moves through the listed terrain, that number is subtracted from the total
movement available to the character or creature that day.
