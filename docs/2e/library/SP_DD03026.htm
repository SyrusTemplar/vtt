<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Armorer:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character with this proficiency can make the types of armor typically
available in the campaign world. The armorer requires the proper raw materials
(plate metal, tough leather, etc.) and enough time to do the job properly. Time
ranges from about two weeks for a shield to 20 weeks for a suit of plate mail
armor. No proficiency check is required generally, though if the armorer tries to
rush the job or work with less than adequate materials a proficiency check should
be rolled to determine if the character is successful.
<P></P>
The armorer can also make field repairs to armor that has been damaged through
use. These repairs always require proficiency checks, and if the check fails
the armor or shield is lost.
