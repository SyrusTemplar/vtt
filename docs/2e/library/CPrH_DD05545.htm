<P></P>
This deity is the manifestation of the world in all its aspects. He's not just
a god of growing things, plants and animals; he also represents weather,
volcanoes, earthquakes, flood, and many other powerful natural forces. Many
earth-gods are also makers of monsters.
<P></P>
This god's priests are a vigorous sect who insist that everyone worship the
god, for without the god all creatures on the face of the world could not exist.
<P></P>
Lesser gods of this attribute would represent only one aspect of the earth.
One might be a god of earthquakes, one a god of stony mountains, one a god of
caves and caverns. The gods of Agriculture, Animals, Nature and Vegetation can
also be considered lesser gods of the Earth attribute.
<P></P>
Lesser gods are as likely to be male as female, but the comprehensive god of
all the earth is probably female.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with Druids and the priests of
Agriculture, Animals, Fertility, Life-Death-Rebirth Cycle, Nature, Seasons,
Sky/Weather, and Vegetation.
