As noted earlier, a bard's initial reputation applies to his home town only.
This reputation increases and decreases based upon reputation modifiers.
Furthermore, the decision whether to become infamous or famous must be made. This
selection determines how certain events affect the bard's reputation.
<P></P>
When a bard enters another village, town, or city, his reputation should be
determined for that area. This is done by consulting <A HREF="DD05010.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD05010.htm">Table 27</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. The bard's closest established reputation is used as a base. An established
reputation is defined as a place in which the bard has put on some form of
entertainment performance. The closest established reputation is then adjusted by
distance.
<P></P>
For example, if the nearest established reputation is two towns away, the
bard's local reputation is four levels lower. If the bard wishes to establish a
local reputation, he simply puts on a public performance or series of performances
(spread out over no more than a year's time). Each performance costs the bard
100 gp per 1,000 citizens in the town (<I>i.e.,</I> 1 silver piece per person). The bard then becomes an established performer in
the community.
<P></P>
Once a reputation is established, it is never again influenced by other
established reputations. Thus, after Hanalacious's big performance in Hardby, her
reputation in Greyhawk City has no impact upon her reputation in Hardby. She thus
has an independent, established reputation in both cities. Hana's player should
write down the two city names and note Hana's reputation next to each name.
