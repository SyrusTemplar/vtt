This spell enables a number of creatures equal to the caster's level to force
march for a number of days equal to the caster's level. Creatures affected by <I>easy march</I> can travel 2 Â½ times their normal movement rate without any risk of fatigue;
thus, they are not required to make a Constitution check at the end of the day.
<P></P>
All creatures affected by this spell suffer a -1 penalty to their attack rolls
for the duration of the spell; this modifier is not cumulative (that is, a
party experiencing its second day of <I>easy march</I> suffers only a -1 penalty). The modifier cannot be negated by resting.
<P></P>
<I>Easy march</I> has no effect on modifiers to movement due to terrain, fatigue, weather, or
other normal factors.
