A magical duel allows player characters to test their spellcasting prowess in
any number of ways. For example, if a party finds a valuable magical item
suitable for either of the group?s two wizard PCs, the two characters could conduct
a friendly duel to see which one gets the item.

Magical duels can be a useful tool for the DM as well. A nonlethal duel is an
excellent way for a rising druid to match wits with an NPC rival when advancing
a level. In a similar vein, an NPC wizard might refuse to cooperate by sharing
a new spell or some other bit of magical knowledge with the PCs until one of
the party spellcasters defeats one of his apprentices?or perhaps the NPC
himself?in a duel.

A magical duel can also make an excellent climactic encounter in an adventure.
For example, a lich might offer to duel a PC wizard or priest to the death,
providing a real challenge to the character. Of course, the rest of the party
might have their hands full beating off a sneak attack by the lich?s minions while
the duel proceeds, but a duel might give the heroes a better than normal
chance to actually slay the lich and still escape the lair with their skins intact.
Don?t forget the problem of finding a mediator for the duel. (Do the PCs trust
the lich?s sinister necromancer apprentice, or does another party spellcaster
step forward, which commits two player characters to the duel?)
