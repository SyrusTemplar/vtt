These instruments may have to be resorted to if a thief cannot pick a lock,
but thinks he has the time to try these desperately slow methods for bypassing
the lock. With a file or hacksaw blade the thief can try to saw through the lock
apparatus; a pair of small wire cutters may also be useful for disabling some
part of the internal mechanism. Usually, only reasonably small locks can be cut
through in this way. It may also be possible for the thief to cut around a lock
with a hacksaw blade.

Again, use of such instruments is often fairly noisy (although nowhere near as
noisy as using a lock chisel). The main drawback to cutting through or around
locks is that it takes a very, very long time. in most cases the attempt will
be certain to succeed, unless there are special circumstances?e.g., the thief
has only one small rusty file and the lock is a huge combination lock device!
