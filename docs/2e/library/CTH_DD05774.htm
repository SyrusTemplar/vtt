As the<I> Dungeon Master's Guide</I> mentions (p. 15), it is possible to design new character races for your
campaign. Some of these characters likely will end up joining the thief class.
<P></P>
The races most commonly adapted for characters are humanoid?ogres, orcs, and
half-breeds of those races; goblins, kobolds, and possibly even hobgoblins or
bugbears. As thieves, these characters favor the kits of highwaymen (that is,
bandits) and thugs?they prefer armed robbery, where no great deal of finesse,
delicacy, or dexterity is required.
