This is a catch-all phrase for any condition or situation that may affect the
actions next round. Did a character get knocked down during the fight? Heâ€™ll
start the next round prone. Generally, magical effects and continuing damage
(poison, burning, acid, etc.) actually inflict their damage in this part of the
combat round.
