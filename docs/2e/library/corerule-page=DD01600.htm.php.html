<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Tightrope Walking:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The character can attempt to walk narrow ropes or beams with greater than
normal chances of success. He can negotiate any narrow surface not angled up or
down greater than 45 degrees. Each round the character can walk 60 feet. One
proficiency check is made every 60 feet (or part thereof), with failure indicating a
fall. The check is made with a -10 penalty to the ability score if the surface
is one inch or less in width (a rope), a -5 penalty if two inches to six
inches wide, and unmodified if seven inches to 12 inches wide. Wider than one foot
requires no check for proficient characters under normal circumstances. Every
additional proficiency spent on tightrope walking reduces these penalties by 1.
Use of a balancing rod reduces the penalties by 2. Winds or vibrations in the
line increases the penalties by 2 to 6.

The character can attempt to fight while on a tightrope, but he suffers a -5
penalty to his attack roll and must roll a successful proficiency check at the
beginning of each round to avoid falling off. Since the character cannot
maneuver, he gains no adjustments to his Armor Class for Dexterity. If he is struck
while on the rope, he must roll an immediate proficiency check to retain his
balance.
