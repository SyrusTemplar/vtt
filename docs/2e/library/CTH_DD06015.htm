<B> Bag of Vanishing:</B> This appears to be a simple pouch capable of carrying some 2-3 lbs. or so. In
fact, it operates as a bag of holding capable of carrying up to 50 lbs. weight
while having an encumbrance of only 3 lbs. Further, the <I>bag of vanishing</I> can have its drawstrings tugged tightly once per day and it will simply
disappear for six turns; the equivalent of a rope trick spell will operate on the
bag (although it will stay with its owner) and it will also have detection
resistance operating upon it.
<P></P>
This bag is invaluable for smuggling, as should be obvious. The only problem
is that each time the rope trick function is used there is a 5% chance that the
contents will vanish into the Ethereal Plane and the bag will be empty when it
is checked later.
<P></P>

<B>Boxes of Delightful Transports:</B> These wooden boxes are 6-inch cubes, and come in identical pairs (often
decorated with great attention to detail). When a nonliving object of suitable size
is placed in one and the lid closed and a command word spoken, the object will
disappear, only to reappear (effectively teleported) in the matching box. This
function operates up to three times per day.
<P></P>
While <I>boxes of delightful transports</I> are obviously very useful, they have certain limitations. It is not possible
for the object-teleport to cross any planar barriers. And, while the distance
between the boxes is not important in affecting the teleport range, there is
always a 5% chance that the object dispatched will not reach its destination,
instead appearing at some random location 10d10 miles away. Thus, dispatch of
valuables is not recommended. The boxes are more often used to send messages, which
can always be sent in duplicate (which gives very high chances for at least one
successful dispatch).
<P></P>
The major limitation on use of these boxes, though, is that no enchanted
object can be teleported using them. Even the placing of a simple <I>Nystul's Magic Aura</I> spell on an object will prevent its being teleported using these boxes.
Hence, magical items such as rings, potions, amulets and other such things, small
enough to fit into one of these boxes, cannot be teleported to a distant location.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Dust of Trail Dispersion:</B> A generous pinch of this magical dust, when scattered over the beginning or
origin of a trail (such as at the bottom of a wall surrounding a house the thief
has burgled, at the point he reaches the ground) will prevent its being
followed by all normal sensory means (rangers, bloodhounds, etc.). The dust is
usually found in a small box, or packets, with one &quot;find&quot; usually being sufficient
for 1d4+4 uses.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Lens of Remote Viewing:</B> These small, clear gems (the term &quot;lens&quot; is a slight misnomer here) appear to
be worthless quartz, but in fact possess a powerful dweomer. If the owner
attunes himself to a <I>lens of remote viewing</I> (a process which takes four hours of meditation), he can then &quot;see&quot; through
the lens whatever scene is happening in front of the lens and within its field
of vision, wherever the lens may later be. There is no range limit, save that no
perception across the planes is possible. No auditory information is detected
through the lens, and no spells can be cast through it. A <I>lens of remote viewing</I> is also detection resistant. At any one time, any thief may be attuned with a
number of such lenses not exceeding one-half his Intelligence score (round
fractions down). These items are usually found singly, and are of obvious value in
spying.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Lens of Valuation:</B> This highly-prized item consists of a lens some 3 inches in diameter with a
handle some 6 inches long. The lens allows the viewer to estimate the true worth
of any nonmagical object to within 5%, on studying it for five rounds or
longer. Of course, this will be an average price, and special conditions of supply
or demand may make this valuation wildly inaccurate.
<P></P>
Merchants usually go to considerable lengths to prevent any <I>lens of valuation</I> from being used on their goods! In the thieving community, it is most
sought-after by fences, who can widen their operations in a major way if they possess
this item.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Tallin's Tightrope:</B> This modified <I>rope of climbing</I> will only snake forward at an angle of up to 45 degrees upward or downward,
but it also enables its owner and up to five man-sized or smaller creatures
touched by its owner to walk upon it as if they had the tightrope walking
proficiency, with a +4 bonus to any proficiency checks required. Anyone not touched by
the rope owner attempting to walk on it will suffer a -4 penalty to any saves or
checks made while on the rope. In all other ways, this item is identical to a
normal <I>rope of climbing.</I>
