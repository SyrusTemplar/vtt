<P></P>
The DM smiles to himself—the bugbears have maneuvered the heroes right where
they want them. The two bugbears fighting Pascal can guard, getting the first
attack against the paladin because of their longer range. The two bugbears hiding
behind the room’s corners will move forward to engage Pascal’s flank and
Lyssa. The DM asks the players to state their actions for the round:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I> Pascal: “I’ll move up and attack again.”
<P></P>
Lyssa: “Cast acid arrow at the bugbear hiding in the corner there.”
<P></P>
Damiar: “Keep firing!”
<P></P>
Dain: “I’ll move and take a shot at a bugbear. Nothing’s coming down this
hallway.”
<P></P>
</I>
<P></P>
The initiative roll is won by the players again, beating the bugbears with a
2. There are no very fast actions this round.
<P></P>
In the fast phase, Pascal moves up to threaten the bugbears facing her, but
they both get attacks since they were guarding and out-ranged her. One bugbear
misses, but the other hits for 5 points of damage and a roll for a knockdown. A
morningstar is rated as a d10 for knockdowns, and since the bugbear is a Large
creature, that is stepped up to a d12. It takes a 7 to knock down a Man-sized
creature, and the Bugbear rolls a 9. Success! Pascal rolls a saving throw vs.
paralyzation and fails. She is on the ground and has to use this round to stand up
again.
<P></P>
Lyssa’s spell is again fast. She <I>throws Melf’s acid arrow</I> at the bugbear previously wounded by Damiar and hits it for 8 points of
damage. Dain takes a half-move and steps into the doorway beside Damiar.
<P></P>
On the average phase, Damiar fires his first arrow of the round and misses.
Pascal would have attacked this round, but decides to stand up again. The
bugbears hiding around the corners move up to threaten Pascal and Lyssa.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I> Pascal: “Sure, now they break cover since I got knocked down.”
<P></P>
DM: “You didn’t think those two bugbears were going to stay out of the way
forever, did you?”
<P></P>
Lyssa: “We’re in trouble.”
<P></P>
DM: “We’re up to slow actions now. Dain and Damiar have shots, if they want to
take them. You’ll be shooting into a melee now, since there aren’t any
bugbears clear of the fight.”
<P></P>
Damiar: “I’ll take my chances.”
<P></P>
Dain: “Me, too!”
<P></P>
Lyssa: “Hey, you could hit us!”
<P></P>
Dain (shrugging): “So? You can take it.”
<P></P>
</I>
<P></P>
There are three bugbears who are threatening Pascal. Using the Firing into a
Melee rules, the DM determines that a d8 roll should be used to resolve who
becomes the target. (The three bugbears are Large and count for 2 each, and Pascal
counts for 1 target. An 8 result will be rerolled.) Damiar and Dain are
lucky—the target rolls end up being bugbears. Unfortunately, both characters miss with
their attacks.
<P></P>
The two bugbears who moved in this round get to attack in their half of the
slow phase. One attacks Pascal, and the other attacks Lyssa. Pascal is hit again
for 5 more points of damage, but this time she isn’t knocked down. Lyssa gets
clobbered for 6 points of damage and begins to consider a strategic withdrawal.
<P></P>
At the end of the round, everyone marks off their fatigue points. Pascal loses
two more, as do Dain and Damiar, but Lyssa cast a spell and loses none. The
bugbears who broke cover and attacked Lyssa and Pascal lose two, but the others
who were already engaged only lose one each.
<P></P>
Since Pascal was hit without hitting her opponents, the bugbears can force her
to retreat. She is driven back one square, but the bugbears hold their ground
to keep their reach advantage. The continuing damage from the <I>Melf’s acid arrow</I> spell doesn’t begin until next round, since Lyssa just cast the spell this
round.
