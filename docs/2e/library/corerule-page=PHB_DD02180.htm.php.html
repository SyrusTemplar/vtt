By means of this spell, the caster or any other willing person can be put into
a cataleptic state that is impossible to distinguish from actual death.
Although the person affected can smell, hear, and know what is going on, no feeling
or sight of any sort is possible; thus, any wounding or mistreatment of the body
is not felt, no reaction occurs, and damage is only one-half normal. In
addition, paralysis, poison, or energy level drain does not affect a person under the
influence of this spell, but poison injected or otherwise introduced into the
body becomes effective when the spell recipient is no longer under the
influence of this spell, although a saving throw is permitted. However, the spell
offers no protection from causes of certain death--being crushed under a landslide,
etc. Only a willing individual can be affected by a <I>feign death</I> spell. The priest is able to end the spell effect at any time, but it
requires a full round for bodily functions to begin again.
<P></P>
Note that, unlike the wizard version of this spell, only people can be
affected, and that those of any level can be affected by the priest casting this spell.
