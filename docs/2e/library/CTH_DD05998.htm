This is simply a long, slender, rapier-like blade concealed within what
appears to be a simple walking stick or cane. The long and thin blade requires a
weapon proficiency slot to be used most effectively. Swashbucklers are particularly
fond of this weapon. Damage done by the blade is as per a short sword. It
takes one round to draw the blade from the sword stick and ready it for use. The
main use of the weapon, obviously, is the possibility of smuggling it into places
where weapons are not permitted.

It is highly doubtful whether anything like a sword stick existed in medieval
times, but this weapon definitely adds some style and dash to a campaign. Since
it does less damage than most swords (and requires a weapon proficiency) the
DM should consider allowing it in his game.
