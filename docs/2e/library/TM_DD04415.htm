This spell requires the priest to concentrate and cast the spell for the full
duration of the spell. The casting time and duration are simultaneous; both
activities occur in the same turn.
<P></P>
In the first round of casting, the priest summons an enormous black storm
cloud over the area of effect. Lightning and crashing claps of thunder appear
within the storm; creatures in the area of effect must make a saving throw or be
deafened for 1d4 turns.
<P></P>
On the second round, acid rains down in the area, inflicting 1d4+1 points of
damage. No saving throw is allowed.
<P></P>
On the third round, the caster calls six lightning bolts down from the cloud.
Each is directed at a target by the priest (all may be directed at a single
target or they may be directed at six separate targets). Each lightning bolt
strike causes 8d8 points of damage (a successful saving throw indicates half damage).
<P></P>
On the fourth round, hailstones rain down in the area, causing 3d10 points of
damage (no saving throw).
<P></P>
On the fifth through tenth (and final) rounds, violent rain and wind gusts
reduce visibility to five feet. Movement is reduced 75%. Missile fire and
spellcasting from within the area of effect are impossible.
<P></P>
The sequence of effects ceases immediately if the priest is disrupted from
spellcasting during the 1 turn duration of the spell. The priest may opt to cancel
the effects at any time.
