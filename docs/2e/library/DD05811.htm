<I> Description:</I> The Bounty Hunter is a ruthless mercenary, worshipping little besides the
price on his target's head, recognizing few laws save the contractual distinction
between &quot;kill&quot; and &quot;capture.&quot; He may be found serving the state, capturing
criminals and bringing them to justice; or he may serve the shadowy lords of the
underworld, avenging the twisted honor found among thieves and criminals. Pursuit
of his quarry may take him through a thousand hostile environments, to foreign
lands, even to alien planes. He is a hunter of men.
<P></P>
The Bounty Hunter's vocation is rigorous and demanding at every level:
physical, psychological, even moral. It requires a sure hand and a stable mind. To be
a Bounty Hunter, a thief must have minimum scores of 11 in every ability except
Charisma. One thing that doesn't really matter to a tough, independent thief
like this is whether or not people like him.
<P></P>
A further requirement is that the Bounty Hunter be of a non-lawful alignment.
The reasons for this are discussed below.
<P></P>
<I>Role:</I> It is important to draw a distinction between the Bounty Hunter and the
Assassin, for their vocations are similar.
<P></P>
The Assassin is most often part of a larger network or organization?either a
society of Assassins for hire, or a guild or crime family, or even a government.
The Assassin is retained by that organization to discreetly eliminate its
enemies; he is strictly a killer. The Assassin also is a predominantly urban
figure, though his missions may take him out of that setting on occasion. Most
organizations that have Assassins would deny their existence, because of the highly
illegal and unpopular nature of their activities.
<P></P>
The Bounty Hunter, by contrast, is a loner. He may be solicited directly by an
employer, but more often he simply learns of a price offered for the body
(living or dead) of some person and goes after him.
<P></P>
While the Assassin requires secrecy and anonymity, the Bounty Hunter thrives
on infamy. Fear leads his prey to make mistakes, and each such mistake brings
the Bounty Hunter one step closer to success. While an Assassin is often hired to
kill relatively normal, often unsuspecting people, the Bounty Hunter is
tracking fugitives?people who know who's after them, and are therefore exceptionally
desperate and dangerous.
<P></P>
Pursuit of such people may lead the Bounty Hunter to literally any place, even
to other planes of existence (if the prospective reward will make the venture
worthwhile), and so the Bounty Hunter becomes adept at survival and tracking in
all manner of hostile environments.
<P></P>
Bounty Hunters do not track only fugitives. They may be hired to perform such
tasks as kidnapping, freeing kidnapped persons, or (especially at lower levels,
when they are still developing their skills) recovering stolen property.
<P></P>
The law and authorities do not always look kindly upon Bounty Hunters, though
they will permit their existence so that they, too, may benefit from the
manhunters' expertise. For the same reason, thieves' guilds tolerate the Bounty
Hunters, despite the fact that almost no Hunter would ever join their ranks.
<P></P>
<I> Secondary Skills:</I> Any.
<P></P>
<I>Weapon Proficiencies:</I> The Bounty Hunter is permitted the use of any weapon. As part of his persona
and fearsome public image, a Bounty Hunter will often gain proficiency in a
rare or bizarre weapon, such as the khopesh sword or man-catcher. Non-thief
weapons take up two of the Bounty Hunter's weapon proficiency slots, but he is
granted a bonus slot at 1st level.
<P></P>
<I>Example:</I> Borg Tartan takes the Bounty Hunter thief kit. This means he has 3 initial
weapon proficiency slots. Two he fills with a nonthief weapon, two-handed sword,
and in the third he takes the hand crossbow.
<P></P>
<I>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</I> Required: Tracking. Recommended: Alertness, Animal Handling/Training, Animal
Noise, Boating, Direction Sense, Fire-building, Gather Intelligence, Herbalism,
Hunting, Intimidation, Observation, Riding, Set Snares, Survival, Trailing.
<P></P>
<I> Skill Progression:</I> Bounty Hunters make frequent use of almost all thief skills, except perhaps
pick pockets.
<P></P>
Note that &quot;pick pockets&quot; includes all sorts of delicate feats of manual
dexterity, such as slipping poison or a &quot;mickey&quot; into a drink. Deadly poisoning is
more frequently the province of the Assassin, but a carefully placed, powerful
sedative may save a Bounty Hunter a great deal of trouble. (To have access to
sedatives or understand their use, a Bounty Hunter must have herbalism
proficiency.)
<P></P>
<I> Equipment:</I> Besides the usual range of thiefly equipment, Bounty Hunters take interest in
items for killing and capturing their prey. Special items from the equipment
chapter, such as blade boots, death knives, folding bows, and the like, are
sometimes taken as favorite weapons. A rope for holding live prisoners is, of
course, vital, and it may also be used for setting snares. Blinding powder and
incapacitating poisons (paralytic ones or those that make their victim ill and
helpless) may also have value.
<P></P>
Bounty Hunters make little use of deadly poisons?that is more the province of
the stealthy Assassin. If a Bounty Hunter is out to kill a fugitive, he
probably won't be worrying about how messy it will be.
<P></P>
<I>Special Benefits:</I> None.
<P></P>
<I> Special Hindrances:</I> None.
<P></P>
<I>Races:</I> Members of any race could become Bounty Hunters. Among the nonhumans,
however, those of mixed blood (e.g., half-elves) favor it most, since they are often
outsiders, loners not accepted by either side of their ancestry.
