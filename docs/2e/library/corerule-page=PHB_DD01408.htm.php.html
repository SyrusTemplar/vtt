<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Before we even start, I want to make sure everyone
understands one very important fact:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="4"><FONT COLOR="RED">This is not AD&amp;D 3rd Edition!</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">There, everyone can breathe again.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Rest assured that this is still the same version of
the AD&amp;D game that your friends, classmates, and business
partners have been playing for years.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Yes, there are some small and subtle changes in the
rules, but you would have to read the whole book very carefully, and
have a tremendous memory, to find them. (The changes are the sorts of
minor corrections and clarifications we make every time we reprint,
and we've reprinted both the <I>Player's Handbook</I> and <I>Dungeon
Master Guide</I> more than 10 times since 1989!)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">So what has changed? Obviously, the books look
different. We were awfully proud of them when they were released in
1989, but the world doesn't stand still for anyone. We decided that
after six years, it was time for a new look.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">And as long as AD&amp;D was getting a new suit of
clothes, we elected to let out the seams a bit, too. Both books are a
lot bigger: 25% more pages in the <I>PHB</I>, 33% more in the <I>DMG</I>.
And we used them up just looking good. Inside you'll find bigger
illustrations, lots more color, and pages that are easy to read.
Making the switch turned out to be a lot more work than most of us
expected it to be, but it was well worth the effort.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Since the 2nd Edition was released, the AD&amp;D game
has grown in ways we never anticipated. We've traveled to a multitude
of fabulous worlds, from the misty horror of Ravenloft, to the exotic
bazaars of Al Qadim, and across the burning face of Dark Sun. Now the
endless horizons of Planescape beckon to us, and beyond even that we
see spearpoints and banners waving above the gathering armies of
Birthright. And, of course, presiding over it all is the grand and
legendary Forgotten Realms.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Products change, but our goal stays the same: to
publish things that make fantasy gamers exclaim, &quot;That's just
what I was looking for!&quot; And we do it for the same reason that
you play: because it's fun!</FONT></P>
