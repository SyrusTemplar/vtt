This spell transmutes one type of liquid into an equal amount of a different,
nonmagical fluid (water, wine, blood, oil, apple cider, etc.). The caster must
touch the fluid itself (not simply its container) for the spell to take effect.
<P></P>
Magical liquids (such as potions) receive a saving throw vs. disintegration
with a +3 bonus to avoid the spell's effect. Fluids can be transmuted only into
nonmagical liquids; it is not possible to change a magical liquid into another
type of magical liquid. Poisons may be rendered harmless through use of this
spell, but the spell has no effect on poisons already consumed.
<P></P>
Living creatures are unaffected by the spell, excluding those from the
elemental plane of water. Such creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell. Failure
results in 1d4 points of damage per level of the caster, while success
indicates half damage. Only one creature can be affected by a single casting of this
spell, regardless of the creature's size.
<P></P>
The material component is a drop of the liquid that the caster intends to
create, which must be placed on the wizard's tongue and consumed. Creating poisons
through use of this spell is especially dangerous.
