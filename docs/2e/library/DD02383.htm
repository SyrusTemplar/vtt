combat system round lasts about 10 to 15 seconds, during which a typical
swordsman will make about three to six swings. Most characters and monsters can only
make one effective attack in this time; the rest of the swings are feints,
parries, or just for show.
<P></P>
Higher-level characters with multiple attacks are able to make more of these
swings count. Parries are followed up with ripostes. Feints suddenly become
attacks when an opening presents itself. With time and practice, a skillful
swordsman can make every swing of his sword a potentially lethal attack.
