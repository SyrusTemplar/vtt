The crusader is a priest of a deity of war, combat, or conflict who stands at
the forefront of the fight for his faith. Crusaders must be either lawful or
chaotic in alignment; in other words, crusaders may be of any alignment except
neutral evil, neutral good, or true neutral. Since they are often called upon to
lead the forces of their faith into battle, crusaders require high Strength and
Charisma scores in addition to a minimum Wisdom of 9. High Constitution or
Dexterity scores are also very useful for a crusader. A crusader with Wisdom and
Strength scores of 16 or better gains a 10% bonus to the experience points he
earns. In matters of advancement, crusaders use the same column as clerics do on <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01478.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01478.htm.php.html">Table 23</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> : Priest Experience Levels in the <I>PHB.</I>

While crusaders are often associated with war gods, they may also represent
powers of leadership or strong alignment that are in conflict with opposing
forces. Crusaders often organize themselves into a military hierarchy and view their
temples as fortifications as well as places of worship. In some cases, the
power of the crusader orders can rival the strength of the kingdom that hosts
them. This is a situation that sometimes provokes popular resentment or suspicion.
However, no one questions their ability and resolve in times of war.
<P></P>
In the adventuring party, the crusader is a natural leader whose place is in
the front lines of any battle. When possible, the crusader should take steps to
prepare his comrades for battle through the use of <I>bless, prayer, aid</I>, and similar spells. He can also make use of healing spells to assist those
who fall in valiant battle.
<P></P>
Crusaders excel in personal combat and are nearly as skilled as a warrior of
the same level. They may employ any kind of armor or shield and learn the use of
any weapon, although particular orders of crusaders may prefer weapons of a
certain type—for example, knightly weapons, bows or battle axes (for elven or
dwarven crusaders), and so on. To represent their skill at arms, the THAC0 of a
crusader character improves at the warrior’s rate of 1 per level. A 2nd-level
crusader has a THAC0 of 19 instead of 20, a 3rd-level crusader has a THAC0 of 18,
and so on.
<P></P>
Crusaders are considered to have a nonweapon proficiency crossover with the
warrior group and may learn warrior proficiencies at no extra cost. They may use
any magical item normally usable by priests or by fighters. In addition, if the
DM allows, a lawful good crusader may gain the same benefits as a paladin when
wielding a <I>holy avenger </I>sword.
<P></P>
While crusaders are formidable soldiers, they also retain a good selection of
spells that are particularly useful on the battlefield. Crusaders have major
access to the spheres of all, combat, guardian, healing, war, and wards. They
have minor access to the necromantic and protection spheres. In addition, lawful
crusaders have major access to the sphere of law, and chaotic crusaders have
major access to the sphere of chaos.

Crusaders cannot turn undead, but at 3rd level they gain the granted power to
cast <I>lighten load </I>(from the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dTM_DD04276.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dTM_DD04276.htm.php.html">Tome of Magic</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> ) once per day. This spell effectively halves the weight of equipment and
gear for a day, reducing a party’s encumbrance. At 7th level, the crusader may
cast <I>easy march </I>(from <A HREF="corerule-page%3dTM_DD04347.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dTM_DD04347.htm.php.html">Tome of Magic</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> ) once per week, which basically allows a small party to force march without
accumulating fatigue penalties.
<P></P>
Crusaders gain followers much as clerics do. When the crusader reaches 8th
level, he automatically attracts 20 to 200 fanatical followers. These followers
are normal 0-level soldiers, armed and equipped with weapons appropriate for
typical soldiers in the campaign. Unlike the cleric, the crusader does not need to
establish a permanent place of worship to attract these followers. Since he is
a great battle leader, the soldiers will serve him as a free-roving company if
no stronghold is available. At 9th level, a crusader may receive official
sanction to establish a religious stronghold or fortified temple.

It is assumed that selecting this class for your Player’s Option character
expends all class-derived character points a character may have available. In
other words, a crusader cannot be customized from the model presented here.
However, if you’re interested in building a specialty priest that resembles the
crusader with slightly different powers, you can use the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03429.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03429.htm.php.html">Customized Priest Characters</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B> </B>information later in this chapter to do so—it’s generally more complete and
