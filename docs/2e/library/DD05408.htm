<A NAME="2dae7db9"></A></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Skyrider</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Description:</B> The Skyrider is a
warrior of the air. Carried by his airborne mount, he soars through
the clouds with the grace of an eagle and the precision of an arrow
in flight. He serves as a defender of both the skyways and the earth.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Skyrider owes his skills to his
unusual relationship with his mount. In certain wilderness societies,
tribal elders select the brightest and strongest children to be
Skyrider candidates. The elders match each child with a young flying
mount. The child and mount are encouraged to share much time
training, playing, even sleeping together. Within a few years, their
bond is so strong that the mount responds to the rider almost intuitively.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Requirements:</B> Standard. Most
Skyriders come from wilderness areas where flying mounts are more
practical than land mounts. Flying mounts can monitor stretches of
open countryside easier than ground mounts, and have less trouble
navigating mountains and other hostile terrain.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Ministration:</B> Any, with Mentor and
Independent the most common.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Role:</B> Though Skyriders make
excellent scouts and explorers, they're particularly useful as
soldiers. Their flying mounts enable them to move quickly to distant
locations, irrespective of rivers, chasms, or other obstacles. They
can target enemies on the ground, breech stronghold walls, and swoop
around enemy forces to attack from behind. They can undertake
reconnaissance missions to determine the size of enemy armies and
monitor their movement.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; In peacetime, a Skyrider can take
advantage of his bird's-eye view to look for virgin farmland and new
trade routes. He can also watch for natural disasters, such as forest
fires and floods. Some teach themselves to track tornadoes and
hurricanes, warning those in a storm's path to take shelter. A
Skyrider can deliver supplies to isolated villages, rescue trapped
explorers, and visit distant islands without a ship.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A Skyrider fulfills many of these same
functions in an adventuring party, scouting ahead for signs of
trouble, attacking enemies from the air, and crossing hostile terrain
to deliver messages and goods. Because a Skyrider often prefers the
company of his mount to that of other people, his companions may find
him cold and aloof.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Symbol:</B> Any symbol that suggests
flight, such as a pair of wings or the profile of a bird.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Secondary Skills:</B> Farmer,
Forester, Hunter.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Any. Because
Skyriders don't suffer the normal mounted missile fire penalties (see
the Special Benefits section below), many choose proficiencies in the
longbow, crossbow, or sling.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonus:</I>
Airborne Riding. <I>Recommended:</I> Direction Sense, Hunting,
Tracking, Weather Sense.<I> Forbidden:</I> Jousting*.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Armor/Equipment:</B> Standard.
Usually, the Skyrider must purchase high-quality, customized tack for
his flying mount to ensure maximum comfort and maneuverability.
Depending on the size and species of the mount, customized tack
(including bit, bridle, halter, and saddles) costs 20-40 gp. The
Skyrider should also consider full barding for his mount (preferably leather).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Bonded Mount:</B> Griffon, giant
eagle, pegasus, hippogriff, or any other type of flying mount
indigenous to the Skyrider's homeland. The Skyrider acquires his
bonded mount at 1st level.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Benefits:</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp; Combat and Proficiency Bonuses: </I>When
airborne, all nonmissile attacks made by either the bonded mount or
the Skyrider receive a +1 modifier to hit. This includes attacks made
against ground or airborne targets, along with all situations covered
in the Aerial Combat rules in </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="DMG_DD00508.htm">Chapter
9</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> of the <I>DMG</I>. For missile
combat, use the modifiers in Table 21.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, the Skyrider receives a +2
bonus to Airborne Riding proficiency checks for feats involving his
bonded mount.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<I>&nbsp; Longer Relationship:</I> Under normal
conditions, a bonded mount remains with its Skyrider for 15 years.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Faster Training:</I> The Skyrider can
teach his bonded mount a trick in 2-5 (1d4+1) days, a task in 1-2
weeks. Like other bonded mounts, the Skyrider's mount can learn 9-20
tricks and tasks, in any combination.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Telepathic Communication:</I> When the
Skyrider reaches 12th level, he gains the ability to communicate
telepathically with his bonded mount, sending and receiving mental
messages at will. This ability's range is 10 times the Skyrider's
level, in feet.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Hindrances:</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mourning:</I> When the Skyrider loses
his bonded mount, he feels the loss intensely. If the bonded mount
was lost because of the Skyrider's actions&#151;for instance, the
Skyrider's carelessness resulted in the mount's death, or the mount
left because the Skyrider was stripped of his paladinhood&#151;the
Skyrider mourns for 2-5 (1d4+1) months. If the bonded mount served
its full 15 years, or the Skyrider voluntarily releases it, the
Skyrider mourns for 2d4 weeks. During the mourning period, the
Skyrider suffers a &#150;2 penalty to all attack, ability, and
proficiency rolls.</FONT></P>
