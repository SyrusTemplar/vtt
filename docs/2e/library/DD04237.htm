<P></P>
Range: 5 yards/level
<P></P>
Components: V, S
<P></P>
Duration: Instantaneous
<P></P>
Casting Time: 8
<P></P>
Area of Effect: One creature
<P></P>
Saving Throw: Neg.
<P></P>
<P></P>
When this spell is cast, a thin beam of shimmering, kaleidoscopic light shoots
from the wizard's fingertips toward his target. The victim is allowed a saving
throw to resist the beam.
<P></P>
This spell has no effect on nonspellcasters, causing them no harm whatsoever.
Creatures with innate spell-like abilities are also unaffected. Against wizards
and priests, this spell can be devastating. It &quot;short-circuits&quot; the arcane
energy stored in a spellcaster's mind, wiping away a number of memorized spells.
Lost spells must be rememorized.
<P></P>
The number of spells drained is equal to the caster's level minus 1d20. Thus,
a 16th-level wizard drains a maximum of 15 spells, but could drain no spells
depending on the die roll. After subtracting the die roll from the caster's
level, any result of zero or a negative number indicates that the victim loses no
spells.
<P></P>
Spells are drained from the wizard's memorized spells beginning with 1st-level
spells and working up to higher level spells. Any decision regarding which
spell should be drained from a specific level should be determined randomly.
