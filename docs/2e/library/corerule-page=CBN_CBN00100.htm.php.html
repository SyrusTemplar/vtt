A wizard using this spell, which operates much like a <I>forget </I>spell, can permanently burn from the memory of any one creature all knowledge
of either a specific place or person or a time period of up to one year (the
spellcaster may choose the desired result). The spell works on any intelligent
creature by destroying a portion of its brain, but a victim is entitled to a
saving throw vs. death magic to resist the effects of the spell. If successful, the
creature suffers only a painful headache, which dissipates in 1–4 hours but is
otherwise harmless. If failed, the victim suffers 1–6 points of damage from an
excruciating headache, leaving him or her with selected gaps in his memory.
<P></P>
<I>Brainkill</I> can affect only the victim’s memory and ability to recall factual
information. For example, a person thus affected might be completely unable to remember
details of a place, the name, appearance, or any traits of a person, or might
have a one-year blank in his or her memory. The spell has no effect on a person’s
learned abilities or skills. For instance, suppose an individual gained a
swimming proficiency six months before coming under the influence of this spell.
While the victim will no longer recall the swimming lessons, he or she still
retains the ability, though it might not become evident until the victim jumps into
a large body of water. Aside from relearning it as best as one can, the lost
knowledge and memories can never be regained except by a <I>wish</I>.
