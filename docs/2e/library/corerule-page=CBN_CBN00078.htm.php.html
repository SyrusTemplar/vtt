</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As we have seen in the kit descriptions of Chapter One, the mental demands
placed on certain necromancers, as a result of their trafficking with the dead and
lower-planar entities, will eventually wither the sanity of the most stable
individuals. Because of their high wisdom, necromancers rarely go stark-raving
mad. They are almost never incapacitated by their own insanity. Rather, the
necromancer’s own twisted mind becomes a most insidious handicap. The wizard does
not even realize that the mental disability exists, and even if he or she
acknowledges its existence, the necromancer does not care to remove it!
<P></P>
At the DM’s option, when members of certain kits advance a new experience
level, they must make an insanity check. Similar to the fear and horror checks
employed in the RAVENLOFT rules system, an insanity check (also called a madness
check) is a save vs. paralyzation. (Wisdom bonuses normally applied to saves vs.
mental effects are also included.) The mental decay can be treated with <I>cure insanity, heal</I>, or <I>restoration spells</I>.
<P></P>
The necromancer’s “professional” madness does not usually result from a
single, traumatic experience, but rather from a slow destabilization of the mind, a
gradual erosion of the sanity that occurs while learning the terrible secrets of
the Dark Art. A necromancer might also be driven mad by a successful powers
check. For this special case, no insanity check is allowed, since it is
considered a mandatory price by the evil god (which bestows a helpful Dark Gift in
exchange). Madness can also result from a wide variety of causes outlined in the new
4th-level clerical spell <I>cause insanity</I>.
<P></P>
The forms of madness described in this section do not reflect modern medical
definitions. They are intended to provide role-playing opportunities for
experienced DMs and players alike.

<B>Phobia.</B> The character develops an irrational fear of some creature or situation and
will flee or cower whenever confronted with it (treat as if affected by a fear
spell). The victim may also mention or want to discuss the object of fear in any
conversation. Some possibilities are monophobia (fear of being alone),
hemophobia (fear of blood), psychrophobia (fear of cold things), claustrophobia (fear
of containment), necrophobia (fear of corpses), nyctophobia (fear of the dark),
onomatophobia (fear of a certain name), hypnophobia (fear of sleeping),
pnigerophobia (fear of smothering).
<P></P>
<B>Melancholy.</B> The character loses the will to act or participate in a suggested activity.
He or she wants to be left alone and may become violent if disturbed. In any
given situation, the subject is 50% likely to do nothing, regardless of the
danger, even at the risk of personal safety. If berated, pressured, insulted, or
otherwise made to feel inferior, the subject has a 50% chance of becoming violent.
Violent fits last only 1d6 rounds, then the character lapses back into brooding
silence and inaction.
<P></P>
<B>Delusion.</B> The character believes him- or herself to be something or someone that she or
he is not. The wizard takes a new identity and tenaciously holds on to it.
Usually, the character adopts the guise of someone or something unusually
important. An apprentice necromancer may believe himself to be the legendary archmage
Tzunk, who sundered the gates of the fabled City of Brass and scattered the
legions of efreet with his terrible pronouncements from the <I>Codex of Infinite Planes</I>. By the same token, she may also think that she’s a flower or a cat or a
brooch on someone’s jacket. In any case, the character does his or her absolute
best to impersonate the person or thing that’s been identified with. If a player
character is afflicted with this form of madness, the particular choice of a
delusion for the character may be discussed between the DM and the player.
<P></P>
<B>Paranoia.</B> The character experiences delusions of grandeur, accompanied by the absolute
conviction that everyone is thoroughly jealous and out to get him or her. For
instance, a necromancer might believe that she or he has angered some
extraplanar power by delving into the hidden secrets of the cosmos, and this evil deity
(and its mortal minions) are now planning to eliminate him or her. The character
does not trust anyone and may fixate upon a particular person or creature as
the leader of the conspiracy. The necromancer sees evidence of the great cosmic
conspiracy in everything and everyone.
<P></P>
<B>Hallucinations. </B>The character constantly sees things that simply aren’t there. He or she may
see hallucinatory enemies in any combat situation or whenever a saving throw or
ability check is required. Hallucinations can be most entertaining to role-play
in combination with a phobia or paranoia. The character may be affected as if
by <I>fear, hypnotic pattern</I>, or even <I>suggestion</I>.
<P></P>
<B>Amnesia.</B> This madness robs the character of minor or temporary memories and factual
knowledge, effectively turning him or her into an “absent-minded” individual. The
character cannot remember facts or events that didn’t take place within the
last few hours. This form of amnesia blocks the ability to recall factual
knowledge, similar to the new 4th-level wizard spell<I> brainkill</I>. It in no way affects professional performance, the ability to cast spells,
and saving throws.
