This spell ages the targeted creature one year per level of the caster.
Unwilling subjects may attempt a saving throw to resist the spell. Subjects affected
by <I>age creature</I> must make a successful system shock roll to survive the change.
<P></P>
Subjects cannot be aged beyond their natural life spans. If the priest's level
indicates that a creature would be aged beyond this level, the creature is
aged to one year short of his maximum age. The spell cannot cause a subject to die.
<P></P>
Human and humanoid characters affected by the spell experience changes in
appearance associated with increased age, such as gray hair and wrinkles. More
significantly, they suffer losses in Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution when
they reach certain age levels. These are summarized in Table 12: Aging Effects in

<P></P>
Nonmagical monsters can be affected by <I>age creature</I>. The DM determines a monster's current age and natural life span based on its
description in the <I>MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM</I> or based on his own judgment. To determine the effects of aging on a monster,
assume the following: a monster is middle-aged when it reaches half its
natural life span; a monster reaches old age at two-thirds of its natural life span;
a monster reaches venerable age in the last one-sixth of its years. A monster
suffers the penalties which follow when it reaches these age levels. The
penalties are<I> cumulative and permanent</I> (unless the affected monster becomes younger).

The reverse of this spell, <I>restore youth</I>, permanently restores age that has been lost as a result of magic (such as an <I>age creature</I> spell). <I>Restore youth</I> reduces the age of the targeted creature by one year per level of the caster.
The subject must make a successful system shock roll to survive the change.
Subjects who become younger regain the lost ability scores described above. A
subject cannot become younger than his actual age as a result of this spell.
