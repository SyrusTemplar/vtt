<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A psionicist can do several actions during a single round. He can:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Make as many psionic attacks as his experience level indicates.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Use one psionic defense.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Activate one psionic power against an open mind.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Maintain as many previously successfully activated powers as he wishes,
provided he can afford to continue paying the PSP costs. Further, if a psionic attack
succeeds and opens a closed mind, a psionic power can be used against the mind
that same round.
