The mysterious figure is a druid with an enigmatic nature. She tends to appear
and disappear regularly--show up, take swift action, vanish suddenly, and
appear again when least expected and most needed.
<P></P>
The mysterious figure normally has a personal mission to fulfill: a wrong to
right, an archenemy to defeat, or a balance to redress. Often she has returned
from exile, escaped death, or overcome some other personal tragedy, and uses her
secretiveness to surprise and confound foes.
<P></P>
The mysterious figure travels regularly, often going about in disguise or in
animal shape. She makes many friends in unlikely places, but reveals her real
identity or purposes only to her closest companions. Her fondness for drama leads
her to save her best spells for a grand entrance or for the crucial moment
where she casts aside her disguise.
<P></P>
Some druids with this personality have a quirky sense of humor. For instance,
the druid may shapeshift into an animal before joining a party, becoming
&quot;adopted&quot; as a pet before revealing her true form (if she does reveal it). This
mischief works best for an NPC among PCs, or vice versa.
<P></P>
But for all her showmanship, the mysterious figure remains a careful and
cunning strategist. She always makes sure she has a few tricks up her sleeve that
even her friends don't know about. If she has a flaw, it is an unwillingness to
share with others the details of her plans.
<P></P>
The mysterious figure works well as an Adviser, Outlaw, Shapeshifter, or
Wanderer. Avoid pairing this personality with the Guardian or Village Druid kits.
