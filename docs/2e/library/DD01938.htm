When this spell is cast, the wizard can create a single emotional reaction in
the subject creatures. The following are typical:
<P></P>
1. <I>Courage:</I> This emotion causes the creatures affected to become berserk, fighting with a
+1 bonus to the attack dice, causing +3 points of damage, and temporarily
gaining 5 hit points. The recipients fight without shield and regardless of life,
never checking morale. This spell counters (and is countered by) <I>fear.</I>
<P></P>
2. <I>Fear:</I> The affected creatures flee in panic for 2d4 rounds. It counters (and is
countered by) <I>courage</I>.
<P></P>
3. <I>Friendship:</I> The affected creatures react more positively (for example, tolerance becomes
goodwill). It counters (and is countered by) <I>hate</I>.
<P></P>
4. <I>Happiness:</I> This effect creates joy and a feeling of complacent well-being, adding +4 to
all reaction rolls and making attack unlikely unless the creatures are subject
to extreme provocation. It counters (and is countered by) <I>sadness</I>.
<P></P>
5. <I>Hate:</I> The affected creatures react more negatively (for example, tolerance becomes
negative neutrality). It counters (and is countered by) <I>friendship</I>.
<P></P>
6. <I>Hope:</I> The effect of hope is to raise morale, saving throw rolls, attack rolls, and
damage caused by +2. It counters (and is countered by) <I>hopelessness</I>.
<P></P>
7. <I>Hopelessness:</I> The affected creatures submit to the demands of any opponent: surrender, get
out, etc. Otherwise, the creatures are 25% likely to do nothing in a round, and
25% likely to turn back or retreat. It counters (and is countered by) <I>hope</I>.
<P></P>
8. <I>Sadness:</I> This creates unhappiness and a tendency toward maudlin introspection. This
emotion penalizes surprise rolls by -1 and adds +1 to initiative rolls. It
counters (and is countered by) <I>happiness</I>.
<P></P>
<P></P>
All creatures in the area at the instant the spell is cast are affected unless
successful saving throws vs. spell are made, adjusted for Wisdom. The spell
lasts as long as the wizard continues to concentrate on projecting the chosen
emotion. Those who fail the saving throw against <I>fear</I> must roll a new saving throw if they return to the affected area.
