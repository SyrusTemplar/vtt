<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">All player characters begin with some amount of cash. This nest egg may be
your character's life savings. It may be a gift from his parents to start him out
in the world. It may be his booty from an army campaign. Perhaps he stumbled
across a small treasure chest, whetting his appetite for greater and more
dangerous prizes. How he came by his money is not important (although it may be fun to
know). You are free to create any explanation you want.
<P></P>
To learn your character's starting funds, roll the dice indicated for his
group in <A HREF="DD01613.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01613.htm">Table 43</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. This is the number of gold pieces your character has to obtain equipment. If
you are creating a character starting out at a level above 1st level, check
with the DM to see if you can increase your character's funds beyond the amounts
given here.
<P></P>
Multi-class characters use the most advantageous die range of their classes.
