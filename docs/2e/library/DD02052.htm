When the wizard employs this spell, he confers upon the recipient the ability
to see all things as they actually are. The spell penetrates normal and magical
darkness. Secret doors become plain. The exact location of displaced things is
obvious. Invisible things become visible. Illusions and apparitions are seen
through. Polymorphed, changed, or enchanted objects are apparent. (The real form
appears translucently superimposed on the apparent form: A gold dragon
polymorphed to human form would appear human with a ghostly dragon looming over the
human form.) Unlike the clerical version of this spell, the recipient cannot
determine alignment. The recipient can focus his vision to see into the Ethereal
Plane or the bordering areas of adjacent planes. The range of vision conferred is
60 feet. True seeing does not penetrate solid objects; it in no way confers
X-ray vision or its equivalent. Furthermore, the spell effects cannot be enhanced
with magic.

The spell requires an ointment for the eyes that is made from a very rare
mushroom powder, saffron, and fat. It costs no less than 300 gp per use and must be
aged for 1d6 months.
