A good tactic against moving enemies or characters who aren-t paying attention
is a trip or tangling maneuver. To pull or trip an opponent, the character
must be armed with a weapon that has the ability to snare someone-s legs. The
following weapons all qualify: bill, bola, bow, light or heavy crossbow, horseman-s
flail, harpoon, javelin, khopesh, lasso, mancatcher, net, footman-s or
horseman-s pick, any polearm, quarterstaff, scourge, spear, staff sling, and whip.
These weapons feature long, staff-like pieces, chains or ropes, or heads that can
catch and pull an enemy-s legs out from under him.

To pull or trip an enemy, the character makes a normal attack roll. If he
hits, he makes an opposed roll of his Strength against the defender-s Dexterity or
Strength, whichever is better. If the attacker wins, the defender is knocked
down. If the defender wins or if both fail, the attack fails. If the roll is a
tie, they both fall down.

For purposes of this maneuver, a monster-s normal movement rate can be
considered its Dexterity score. Its Strength is equal to 31/2 points per size plus its
Hit Dice. There are several modifiers that apply to the attacker-s Strength,
however:

<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> 4-point bonus or penalty per size difference of the attacker versus the
defender;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> ?2 to attacker-s Strength if the target has four legs or more;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> +3 if the defender was unaware of the pull or trip attack;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> ?6 if the defender was stationary.

<I>For example, Alvoth is waiting in ambush for the king-s messenger to come
galloping down a wooded lane. He decides to use his halberd to trip the horse when
it comes by. If he hits, he-ll use his Strength against the horse-s move of 18.
Alvoth-s Strength is modified by ?4 for the size difference and ?2 for the
horse-s extra legs, but +3 because he is hiding, so his 17 Strength is an
effective 14 for purposes of tripping the horse.

Optionally, the opposed roll can be replaced by a simple saving throw vs.
paralyzation. It-s not as accurate, but it may be more convenient for the DM and
players to remember.
