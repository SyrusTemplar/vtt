The following methods are different from one another. Some produce more
powerful characters than others (although none produces extremely powerful
characters). For this reason, every player in your game should start out using the same
method.
<P></P>
If, at some later point in your campaign, you want to change methods, simply
announce this to your players. Try to avoid making the announcement just as a
player starts rolling up a new character, lest the other players accuse you of
favoritism. You know you aren't playing favorites, but it doesn't hurt to avoid
the appearance.
<P></P>
The advantages and disadvantages of each dice-rolling method are described
below (also see <A HREF="PHB_DD01422.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01422.htm">page 13</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> of the<I> Player's Handbook</I>). Five sample characters created with each method illustrate typical outcomes
the different methods are likely to produce.
