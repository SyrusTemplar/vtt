verbal, somatic, and material components in order to produce a desired effect. While
all wizards have some degree of familiarity with this field of knowledge, a
character who becomes proficient in thaumaturgy has spent time studying the forms
and practices of magic. This depth of knowledge gives the wizard a +5% bonus
on his learn spell rolls after a successful nonweapon proficiency check has been
made.
