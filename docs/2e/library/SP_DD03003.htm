<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Creating New Kits</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> To design additional kits, DMs should answer these questions.
<P></P>
What role does this kit to serve in the campaign?
<P></P>
What makes this unique from all other kits?
<P></P>
In what ways is it similar to any other kits?
<P></P>
What levels of society would generate characters that would choose this kit?
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Requirements:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> What does a character need to take this kit? What minimum of ability does
this kit require?
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Does this kit give access to weapons not normally allowed certain classes? If
so, why? Are certain weapons associated with this kit?
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended nonweapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> What skills would PCs with this kit likely need?
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Equipment:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Does this kit grant access to equipment not normally available to some
classes. If so, why?
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended traits:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> What characteristics fit an individual with this kit?
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Benefits:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> What extra ability or modifier does this kit grant characters? Is this
benefit too powerful for a kit? Is it too weak? Compare this kit's benefits with the
other kit benefits in this chapter.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hindrances:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> What penalty or modifier compensates for the above benefit without weakening
the character too much or leaving him too powerful?
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wealth:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Is the starting cash of the character affect by this kit? If so, how much?
<P></P>
<P></P>
Once these questions have been answered, a DM should have a pretty good idea
of the compatibility of a new kit. The most important decision to make is
determining if this kit unbalances the game. Contrast and compare it with other kits.
It's much easier to fix the kit now than try to repair a campaign after an
unbalanced kit has damaged it.
<P></P>
The next step is to experiment with the kits in play. Outside the normal
campaign, put this kit through its paces. Run different character classes through an
encounter or two to see if it works the way it was intended. If it does,
introduce it to campaign and have fun. If it doesn-t, head back to the drawing board.
