Each player usually controls one character, but sometimes players may want or
need more. Multiple player characters are fine in the right situation.
<P></P>
Once your campaign is underway and players learn more about the game world,
they may want to have characters in several widely scattered areas throughout
that world. Having multiple characters who live and adventure in different regions
allows a lot of variety in the game. The characters usually are spread far
enough apart so that events in one region don't affect what transpires in the
other.
<P></P>
Sometimes players want to try a different class or race of character but do
not want to abandon their older, more experienced heroes. Again, spreading these
characters out across the world is an effective means of keeping them separate
and unique.
<P></P>
Whenever possible, avoid letting players have more than one character in the
same area. If, for some reason, players must have more than one character in an
area, make sure that the characters are of significantly different experience
levels. Even this difference should keep them from crossing paths very often.
<P></P>
If multiple player characters are allowed, each character should be distinct
and different. It is perfectly fair to rule that multiple characters controlled
by one person must be different classes--perhaps even different races. This
helps the player keep them separate in his imagination.
<P></P>
If a player has more than one character available, ask him to choose which
character he wants to use for the adventure--before he knows what the adventure is
about. If a single adventure stretches across several playing sessions, the
same character should be used throughout. All of the player's other characters
are considered busy with something else during this time.
<P></P>
Avoid letting players take more than one character along on a single
adventure. This usually comes up when the group of characters assembled for the planned
adventure is too small to undertake it safely. The best solution to this
problem is to adjust the adventure, use a different adventure entirely, or supplement
the party with NPC hirelings.
