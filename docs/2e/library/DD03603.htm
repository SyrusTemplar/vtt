A common effect of many critical strikes is bleeding. Bleeding falls into
three categories: minor, major, and severe. In many cases, bleeding may prove more
dangerous than the original injury.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Minor bleeding </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">causes the victim to lose 1d2 hit points per full turn until the wound is
magically healed or bound. There is a chance that minor bleeding will stop on its
own; every time the character suffers damage from the bleeding, he may attempt a
saving throw vs. death magic. If he succeeds, the bleeding stops.
<P></P>
Anybody (including the injured character!) can stop minor bleeding by applying
a bandage. This requires one round.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Major bleeding </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">is much more dangerous, resulting in a loss of 1d2 hit points per round (not
turn) until the injury is healed or bound. In effect, the standard negative 10
rule represents major bleeding; the character loses 1 hit point per round when
reduced to negative hit points.
<P></P>
Major bleeding can be stopped by a <I>cure light wounds </I>spell or the healing of 5 points of damage by any other means. In addition,
the successful use of the healing proficiency halts major bleeding. If the wound
is bound by an untrained character, make an Intelligence check for the would-be
medic; if he fails, he is unable to help, but if he succeeds, the bleeding is
reduced to minor.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Severe bleeding </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">causes the victim to lose 10% to 60% (1d6 x 10%) of his unwounded hit point
total every round. For example, a fighter with 43 hit points would lose 4 (10%)
to 24 (60%) of his hit points every round. A <I>cure light wounds </I>or 5 hit points of healing will reduce severe bleeding to major bleeding; a <I>cure serious wounds </I>or 10 hit points of healing reduces it to minor bleeding; and a <I>cure critical wounds </I>or 20 hit points of healing stops it altogether.
<P></P>
An untrained character has no chance to bind a torso, abdomen, or head wound
with severe bleeding, but a trained healer can attempt a proficiency check with
a ?4 penalty to reduce severe bleeding to major bleeding in these areas. A
trained healer can reduce severe bleeding from a limb to major bleeding with an
unpenalized proficiency check, and an untrained character can do the same with a
successful Intelligence check at a ?4 penalty. Note that once severe bleeding
has been reduced to major bleeding, the character may be able to then reduce the
major bleeding to minor bleeding.
<P></P>
Bleeding from several wounds is cumulative; a character with three cases of
minor bleeding from three separate injuries suffers 3d2 damage every turn. After
a character is reduced to 0 hit points by any level of bleeding, the bleeding
stops, and he simply loses 1 hit point a round until he reaches ?10 and dies.
