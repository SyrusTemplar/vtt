The protectors of tropical rain forests, jungle druids usually grow up in
tribes, as jungle pests, vegetation, and climate discourage farming, herding, and
city-building. Because most tribal members live closely attuned to the natural
world, jungle druids have a greater likelihood of involving themselves directly
in the affairs of humans than other druids might. In fact, a jungle druid like
Sima (pictured on p. 15) usually holds a position of power and respect,
wielding great political authority.
<P></P>
However, jungle druids do not associate themselves with a particular tribe or
people, as do most tribal priests or witch doctors. Instead, they adopt a
neutral position, mediating intertribal feuds and handling relations between human
tribes and jungle-dwelling humanoids, demihumans, or intelligent monsters. In
some cases, a great druid becomes a virtual &quot;king of the jungle,&quot; wielding power
over a coalition of several tribes, nonhumans, and animals.
