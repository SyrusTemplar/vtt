Upon casting this spell, the caster is able to detect snares, pits, deadfalls
and similar hazards along a path 10 feet wide and 40 feet long. Such hazards
include simple pits, deadfalls, snares of wilderness creatures (for example,
trapdoor spiders, giant sundews, ant lions, etc.), and primitive traps constructed
of natural materials (mantraps, missile trips, hunting snares, etc.). The spell
is directional--the caster must face the desired direction to determine if a
pit exists or a trap is laid in that direction. The caster experiences a feeling
of danger from the direction of a detected hazard, which increases as the
danger is approached. The caster learns the general nature of the danger (pit,
snare, or deadfall) but not its exact operation, nor how to disarm it. Close
examination, however, enables the caster to sense what intended actions might trigger
it. The spell detects certain natural hazards--quicksand (snare), sinkholes
(pit), or unsafe walls of natural rock (deadfall). Other hazards, such as a
cavern that floods during rain, an unsafe construction, or a naturally poisonous
plant, are not revealed. The spell does not detect magical traps (save those that
operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring; see the 2nd-level spell <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02169.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02169.htm.php.html">trip</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> and the 3rd-level spell <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02194.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02194.htm.php.html">snare</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">), nor those that are mechanically complex, nor those that have been rendered
