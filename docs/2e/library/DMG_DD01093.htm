<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Dagger +2, Longtooth:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This appears to be a normal weapon, or perhaps a nonspecial magical weapon.
However, when this broad-bladed weapon is wielded by a small demihuman (like a
gnome or halfling), it will actually lengthen and function as a short sword
(retaining its +2 bonus in this form). Even when functioning in this way it remains
as light and handy to use as a dagger would be in the hands of the same
character. The weapon will actually penetrate wood or stone as easily as it will
softer material, inflicting maximum damage against either substance.
