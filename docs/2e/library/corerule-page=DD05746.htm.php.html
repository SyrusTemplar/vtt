   Perhaps the most important aspect of creating a three-dimensional character is
determining his core traits, the values and principles upon which he bases his
philosophy. A character with specific values tends to be more consistent in
his reactions. And while few real-world people are wholly consistent, the more
consistently a character behaves, the more lifelike he'll appear in the context
of a game.
<P></P>
   While no two rangers are exactly alike in their outlook, all share a set of
common traits which form the foundation of their personality. These traits are
described in general terms below, and are not intended to straitjacket a good
role-player. A player doesn't necessarily have to incorporate all of these traits
into his character, but he should think carefully before setting them aside. In
a sense, these traits are as crucial to defining the ranger character class as
his ability scores.

   Rangers have firm values that impel them to promote goodness and justice.
Regardless of whether he's lawful good, neutral good, or chaotic good, a ranger has
definite ideas about the difference between right and wrong. He behaves
honestly, and most rangers believe in altruism and service. Selfishness and greed are
antithetical to the ranger. He champions the powerless and fights for the
weak. In many cases, a ranger's respect for life extends to animals as well as
humans. Though in essence rangers are warriors, most have no fondness for war. Even
when fighting for a cause in which he believes, the ranger looks forward to
the end of the conflict and the natural healing process promised by peace.

   A ranger is as much a creature of the wilderness as a lion or wild horse. Many
rangers find urban life suffocating and would no more make their homes in a
city than volunteer for a prison sentence. A typical ranger prefers songbirds to
orchestras, flowers to jewelry, and forests to grand castles. Most rangers are
sophisticated enough to handle themselves well in urban settings, but they
generally can't wait to finish their business and leave.

   By virtue of his duties and disposition, the ranger spends a lot of time
alone. Most rangers come to enjoy the solitary life, and have no particular need for
the company of other people. In most cases, animals satisfy a ranger's desire
for companionship.
<P></P>
  On the positive side, the ranger's penchant for solitude encourages him to
be self-reliant and independent. On the negative side, rangers may come across
as remote and detached, even antisocial. While a ranger may be perfectly capable
of social etiquette, his companions may believe that he's not especially
interested in fostering lasting friendships.

   By observing wild animals, many rangers have learned the importance of keeping
their emotions in check. A juvenile wolf who charges impulsively is certain to
scare away his prey. A young lioness who makes unprovoked, pointless attacks
against the pride leader may find herself ostracized and alone. Consequently,
rangers often conceal their feelings from friends and strangers alike, revealing
little about themselves in actions or words. For all but the ranger's closest
companions, it's often difficult to tell if he's happy or sad, angry or
forgiving, troubled or content.
<P></P>
   Though rangers certainly experience emotions as deeply as anyone else, many
suffer in silence when wounded, and grieve in private at the loss of a beloved
animal or comrade. A ranger's companions invariably find him to be a dependable,
competent, and trustworthy professional. But as a person, he often remains an
impenetrable enigma.

   Many rangers are deeply and privately spiritual, perceiving their access to
spells and their appreciation of nature as gifts from a greater power. Whether a
ranger worships nature itself as a unifying force or follows an established
religion, he combines his love of nature with his faith to form the foundation of
his moral code. Such rangers regularly reaffirm their commitment through
moments of quiet reflection. (See Chapter 9 for more about rangers and religion.)
