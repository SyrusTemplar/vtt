Greek fire is an alchemical mixture that readily bursts into flame and burns
furiously. A Greek fire projector is a metal tube about six inches wide and five
feet long. When uncapped, it acts like a flame thrower, spraying a line of
flame one square wide and four squares long. The line begins at the projector-s
mouth and extends directly away. Creatures within the area immediately suffer
3d10 points of damage unless they roll a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon
for half of that. Targets suffer an additional 1d10 points of damage during
the next two rounds, regardless of the initial saving throw's result.
