Any specialist can abandon his school, but only to become a mage. A specialist
cannot become a specialist from a different school. A specialist's decision to
abandon his school to become a mage is permanent -- under no circumstances can
he again become a specialist of his original school. A specialist keeps all of
the spell bonuses that he had prior to his conversion, but receives no more
bonus spells after he abandons his school to become a mage. He loses all saving
throw bonuses at the time of his conversion (for instance, he no longer receives
a +1 bonus when making saving throws against spells of his former specialty
that are cast by other wizards).

Once he abandons his school, a former specialist's chances of learning new
spells are affected as follows:
<P></P>

receives a bonus (e.g., an illusionist who abandons his school no longer receives a
+15 percent bonus when attempting to learn illusion spells).
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> When attempting to learn spells from other schools, he still suffers a penalty
(e.g., an illusionist who abandons his school still has a -15 percent penalty
when attempting to learn spells from the schools of alteration, greater
divination, enchantment/charm, and conjuration/summoning).
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> When attempting to learn spells from schools in opposition to his former
specialty, his chance is computed according to the following formula:
<P></P>
<P></P>
Percent chance = 1/2 (base chance to learn a spell -15 percent)
<P></P>
<P></P>
For instance, a former necromancer with an Intelligence of 13 wants to learn
an illusion spell. Since necromancy is one of the schools that was in opposition
to his former school, his chance to learn the spell is 1/2 (55-15), which
equals 20 percent.
