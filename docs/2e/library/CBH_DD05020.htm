As a bard's reputation grows, he begins to attract patrons. These people go
out of their way to attend the bard's performances. Some even take up traveling
with the bard on short performing tours. Such devoted patrons often serve the
bard as stage hands.
<P></P>
Patrons should not be confused with followers. Patrons are more interested in
a bard's performances than in the bard as an individual. They are caught up
with the bard's artistic talents. Some will travel miles to attend as many
performances as possible, others donate silver and gold to ensure that their favorite
performer can support his career. Devoted patrons love his performances so much
that they are willing to help him out in order to get him on stage more often.
Patrons are a valuable commodity to bards and are always treated with care.
