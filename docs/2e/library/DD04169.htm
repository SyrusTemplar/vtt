This spell is the wild mage's ultimate last-resort spell. When cast, the mage
releases a sudden flood of wild magical energy in the hope of seizing and
shaping that energy into a desired spell effect. The attempt usually fails, but
something almost always occurs in the process.
<P></P>
Before casting the spell, the mage announces the spell effect he is trying to
create. The mage must be able to cast the spell (i.e., have it in his spell
books), but need not have it memorized. After announcing the spell (along with the
target and any other conditions required by the spell), the wild mage casts <I>Nahal's reckless dweomer</I>. A burst of magical energy is released, which the wild mage tries to
manipulate into the desired form. The actual effect of the spell is rolled randomly on <A HREF="DD04136.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD04136.htm">Table 2</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">: Wild Surge Results.
<P></P>
Because the release of energy is planned by the mage, his level is added to
the dice roll. If the result indicates success, the mage has shaped the magical
energy into the desired effect. More often than not, the effect is completely
unexpected. The result may be beneficial to the mage or it may be completely
disastrous; this is the risk the mage takes in casting <I>Nahal's reckless dweomer</I>.
