<FONT SIZE="4"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Virtues</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp; Virtues</I> are traits exemplifying
the highest standards of morality, decency, and duty. They comprise
the paladin's personal code. Although not specifically detailed in
the <I>PH</I> definition of a paladin, a paladin's virtues are
implied by his strictures as well as his outlook, role, and
personality. Just as a paladin must obey his strictures, he must also
remain true to his virtues.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Though most paladins adhere to all of the
virtues described below, exceptions are possible. For instance, a
paladin from a primitive society may be so unfamiliar with civilized
etiquette that including <I>courtesy</I> as part of his ethos would
be unreasonable. All adjustments must be cleared by the DM at the
outset of a paladin's career.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no rules for adjudicating
virtue violations. The DM is advised to err in favor of the paladin
when the player makes honest mistakes. Conversely, the player should
graciously accept the DM's rulings and, in the spirit of the paladin,
avoid looking for loopholes to take advantage of the DM's good will.
The entries below include examples of how virtues might influence the
paladin's behavior in the context of a game.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Fealty</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; In feudal times, fealty referred to the
relationship between a warrior and his lord. A warrior swore
allegiance to a lord in exchange for protection, support, and
property. The lord, in turn, could count on the warrior for military
duty and other services. Both the lord and the warrior scrupulously
honored this agreement. <I>Perfidy</I>, the breaking of the promise
by either party, was considered a treacherous breach of faith.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; This book takes a broader view of fealty,
defining it as loyalty not only to a lord but to any lawful good
government, religion, or philosophy. For convenience, we refer to the
recipient of a paladin's loyalty as the <I>patron</I>.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of who&#151;or
what&#151;functions as the patron, fealty gives the paladin a sense
of belonging to something greater than himself. Fealty also sets the
criteria for a paladin's moral code; in essence, the patron
establishes the difference between right and wrong, good and evil.
However, although the patron provides the basic moral code, it is
ultimately the paladin who is responsible for and bears the
consequences of his actions.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>About the Categories</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's take a closer look at the three
categories of fealty patrons:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Religion.</B> A religion is a set of
beliefs centering on one or more omnipotent deities with supernatural
powers. The patron is usually a church representing an established
religion, but can be a deity.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Government.</B> This can be any
individual or governing body with the absolute power to make laws and
declare war. In most campaigns, the patron is usually a monarch.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Philosophy.</B> A philosophy is a
system of ideas that explains the nature of the universe, exclusive
of supernatural beings. The patron may be an established philosophy
developed by scholars, or a unique philosophy developed by the
paladin himself. (Chapter 8 discusses the definition of a philosophy
in more detail, including the differences between philosophies and
religions.) For the purposes of fealty, religion and philosophy are
mutually exclusive; a paladin can't pledge fealty to both.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Choices of Patrons</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Every paladin must pledge fealty to <I>something</I>.
As a minimum, he must pledge fealty to either a religion or
philosophy; this faith is what grants him the special powers
described in Chapter 2. Beyond this requirement, patrons should
derive logically from the paladin's background and outlook. In most
campaigns, the proper patrons will be self-evident. For instance:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; If a paladin follows the tenets of a lawful
good religion and serves in the military of a lawful good ruler, he
probably swears fealty to both his church and government.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; If a paladin comes from a rigid theocratic
culture (a society ruled exclusively by priests) or serves no feudal
lord, he probably pledges fealty to the church alone.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; If a lawful good monarchy has no formal
relationship with an established religion, the paladin might pledge
fealty to a ruler and a philosophy, and not to a church.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; If a paladin operates independently and has no
ties to a government or church, he'll probably pledge fealty to a philosophy.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; For reference, Table 14 lists all
possible fealty combinations. A paladin may pledge fealty to any of
the Permitted combinations (assuming the DM approves). He may<I> not</I>
pledge fealty to any of the Forbidden combinations. The ways in which
governments, religions, and philosophies interact are discussed at
length in Chapter 8.</FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;* For the purposes of fealty, religion and
philosophy are mutually exclusive.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;** Every paladin must pledge fealty to
either a religion or philosophy, which serves as the source of his
special powers (described in Chapter 2).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Obligations of Fealty</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a paladin pledges fealty to a
particular patron, he's bound to that patron indefinitely. Should his
king engage in evil activities, or his church become corrupt, the
paladin may be forced to pledge fealty to another patron; the
Expatriate kit (see </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="DD05403.htm">Chapter
4</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) describes one possible
consequence. Normally, however, a paladin's patrons never change.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The responsibilities associated with
fealty vary with the patron. Monarchs, for instance, may require
their paladins perform military service. Churches may expect their
paladins to follow rigid rules of behavior. The &quot;Edicts''
section elsewhere in this chapter discuses such requirements in
detail. In general, however, fealty requires the paladin to:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Faithfully serve the patron regardless of
personal adversity.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Promote the principles and ideals of the patron.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Honor and respect the representatives and
symbols of the patron.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Sacrifice his life for the patron if necessary.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&#149; Sir Geffen, who has declared fealty to his
king, learns that his homeland has declared war against Dryston, a
neighboring state. Geffen is distressed by the news. Many of his
schoolmates now live in Dryston, and so does his brother-in-law.
Nevertheless, Geffen vows to engage all soldiers of Dryston as
enemies, regardless of who they might be.</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&#149; In a distant village, Sir Geffen hovers on
the edge of death, struggling to recover from serious wounds
inflicted by a red dragon. A compassionate farmer offers to take
Geffen to a medical specialist. Geffen accepts, and the farmer loads
him in his wagon. An hour into their journey, the wagon passes a
herald carrying the banner of Geffen's homeland. Geffen demands that
the cart stop, then insists that the driver lift him to his feet.
Reluctantly, the driver does as he's told. With his last ounce of
strength, Geffen raises his hand to salute the flag.</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Courtesy</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; To a paladin, courtesy involves more than
merely following rules of etiquette. It's also an attitude, a way of
presenting himself to the world. A paladin carries himself proudly,
maintains self-control, and accepts ill-mannered behavior with grace.
He follows social customs to the best of his ability. He is polite
and deferential to friends and strangers alike.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, the paladin must:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Consider the feelings of others and take care
not to offend them. A paladin always demonstrates proper manners
(shaking hands with friends, expressing gratitude for favors). He
also keeps himself immaculately groomed (bathing regularly, wearing
clean clothes).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Speak tactfully and kindly. A paladin never
knowingly insults or slanders another person, even his greatest
enemy. If others engage in insults or slander, the paladin walks away.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Behave with dignity. A paladin refrains from
emotional outbursts, excessive eating and drinking, foul language,
and other boorish acts.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&#149; Sir Geffen asks a grizzled innkeeper for
directions. &quot;My information ain't free,'' snarls the innkeeper.
&quot;Especially for the likes of you.'' The innkeeper spits in Sir
Geffen's face, then glares at him, daring him to respond. Sir Geffen
politely thanks the innkeeper for his time, discreetly wiping the
spittle from his cheek as he turns to leave.</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&#149; After a long day spent slogging through a
muddy swamp, Sir Geffen's companions can't wait to make camp and get
to bed. Sir Geffen, however, stays up for hours, combing dried mud
from his hair and cleaning the grime from his armor.</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Honesty</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A paladin always tells the truth as he
knows it. He may decline to speak or choose to withhold information,
but he will never intentionally mislead anyone, even his enemies. He
may ask permission not to answer a direct question, but if pressed,
he'll tell the truth (however, he may frame his answers in such a way
as to withhold vital information). Though a paladin doesn't make
promises lightly, once he gives his word, he always keeps it.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&#149; Sir Geffen has been captured by an evil
army. The commander demands to know the whereabouts of the paladin's
companions. Sir Geffen says nothing.</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;My spies inform me that your
colleagues plan to arrive at King Relhane's castle by dawn
tomorrow,'' says the commander. &quot;Is this true?''</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp; The commander's information is
accurate, but Geffen remains silent.</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;If you say nothing, I will
conclude that I'm correct.''</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You may conclude whatever you
wish,'' says Geffen.</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&#149; Prevost, a young companion of Sir Geffen,
asks about his performance on the battlefield yesterday. Sir Geffen
believes that Prevost fought ineptly. &quot;With your permission,''
says Geffen, &quot;I prefer not to answer.''</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Please,'' insists Prevost.
 &quot;I want to know.''</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp; Geffen looks him in the eyes.
&quot;Very well. You allowed an opponent to escape. You dropped your
sword at a crucial moment. Your performance was poor.''</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp; Prevost glowers at Geffen, then
angrily stomps away.</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Valor</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A paladin demonstrates unyielding courage
in the face of adversity. No danger is too great to prevent him from
fulfilling a promise or completing a mission. His commitment is
stronger than his fear of pain, hardship, or even death.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A paladin's valor is particularly evident
on the battlefield. He regards war as a noble enterprise, and combat
as an opportunity to glorify the institution he represents. A paladin
attacks an enemy without hesitation, continuing to fight until the
enemy withdraws or is defeated. Whenever possible, a paladin chooses
the most formidable enemy&#151;a powerful monster, a giant, a dragon,
or the leader of an army&#151;as his primary opponent. In general, a
paladin prefers melee to missile combat, so he can engage his
opponent face to face.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&#149; A moment ago, Sir Geffen and his companions
were riding peacefully through a shaded valley when they were
ambushed by a brutish hill giant. The giant snatched young Fredrin
from his horse and is now waving him in the air like a trophy.</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I claim this youth as my
slave!'' thunders the giant. &quot;If you want him back, send your
best man to fight!''</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp; Without hesitation, Sir Geffen rides forward.</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&#149; Locked in battle with an army of ogres, Sir
Geffen's party is suffering mounting casualties. &quot;Withdraw!''
shouts Bordu, a friend of Geffen. &quot;We will regroup and fight
another day!''</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Geffen's companions scramble from
the battlefield, but Geffen lingers behind. &quot;Come with us!''
cries Bordu. &quot;You can't win!''</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Perhaps not,'' says Geffen,
steeling himself for a phalanx of charging ogres. &quot;But I shall
cover your withdrawal as long as I can.''</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; At the DM's discretion, a paladin can
withdraw with honor if outnumbered by more than 2:1 in hit dice. If
the paladin belongs to an elite organization, the DM might allow the
paladin to withdraw if he faces odds of more than 3:1. If the player
suspects such a situation exists, he may ask the DM whether a
withdrawal with honor is possible. With the DM's permission, the
paladin may withdraw without violating his ethos.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Honor</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; An honorable paladin conducts himself
with integrity regardless of circumstance. He behaves in a morally
sound manner even when he's by himself or when no one else will know
of his actions. It's an admirable act to comfort a dying friend, but
an act of honor to comfort a dying enemy.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Honor also involves respect, not just for
the paladin's peers and superiors, but for anyone sharing the
paladin's commitment to goodness and justice. The paladin shows mercy
to the repentant, and refuses to inflict undue suffering even on the
vilest evildoer.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, an honorable paladin:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Defers to the judgment of all lawful good
characters of superior social class, rank, and level.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Acknowledges the dignity of all lawful good
people, regardless of their race, class, or economic status, by
treating them with courtesy and respect.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Accepts all challenges to duel or fight given
by those of comparable status and power. (A challenge from an
arrogant youngster or a drunken warrior may go unheeded).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Dies before compromising his principles,
betraying his liege or faith, or abandoning a protected charge.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&#149; After a lengthy battle, the king of the
lizard men lies bleeding at Sir Geffen's feet. &quot;I beg you,''
gasps the lizard king, &quot;Let me live.'' Sir Geffen reflects. The
lizard king is old and broken. He can no longer be considered a
threat. And he has fought honorably.</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Geffen sheathes his sword. He
motions for his aides to haul the lizard king away. The king will
spend his remaining years in prison.</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&#149; Sir Geffen has been captured by a cult of
evil clerics. Bound with chains, Sir Geffen stares into the eyes of a
cleric who holds a blade to his throat. &quot;Renounce your
blasphemous faith,'' hisses the cleric, &quot;and I will spare your life.''</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Renounce yours, and I will spare
you!'' says Sir Geffen.</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Other Virtues</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Fealty, courtesy, honesty, valor, and
honor will likely be a part of every paladin's ethos. Other virtues
may also be added, subject to the DM's approval. Some possibilities:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Humility.</B> The paladin remains
humble in spirit and action. He rejects adulation and declines
awards. Tributes embarrass him; the knowledge of a job well done
suffices as thanks. He speaks modestly of his deeds, if at all,
grateful for the opportunity to fulfill his moral obligations.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Generosity.</B> The paladin gladly
shares his meager funds and possessions with anyone in need. If he
owns two swords and a elderly hunter has none, the paladin offers one
as a gift. He will give his last crust of bread to a hungry child,
even if he must go without food for the rest of the day. He is also
generous of spirit, always willing to lend an ear to a troubled
companion or acknowledge a friend's accomplishments with lavish praise.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Chastity. </B>The paladin avoids even
the appearance of impropriety, remaining pure in word, deed, and thought.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Celibacy.</B> In addition to remaining
chaste, the paladin vows never to marry.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Industry.</B> The paladin engages in
productive activity at all times. He works diligently and hard until
he completes the job at hand. When not working, he studies,
exercises, or practices his combat skills. He considers leisure
activities, small talk, and vacations to be time-wasting folly.</FONT></P>
