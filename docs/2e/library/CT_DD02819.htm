<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">If the defenders suspect the attackers have begun a mine, they can attempt to
dig their own tunnel and attack the miners. Given general knowledge of an
approaching mine?s position (such as which wall the mine is aimed at) a counter mine
is successful on a roll of 10 or better on 1d20. This chance can fall to
nothing (if the defenders are completely fooled about the mine?s location) or be an
automatic success (if the defenders know where the mine is through divination
magic or reconnaissance). When a counter mine succeeds, the two parties must
fight a melee to see who controls the tunnels. Miners usually wear no armor and
can carry only small weapons, but troops sent in to guard the miners or launch a
counterattack can be armed and armored normally.
