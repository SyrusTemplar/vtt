This is a vital piece of equipment for the serious cat-burglar or
housebreaker. Known in thieves' cant as a &quot;spider,&quot; it is made of linked leather straps,
one around each thigh, one running around the waist, and one over each shoulder.
The straps link together to form a tight harness, which can be worn over
clothing or leather armor. Attached to the harness are up to eight or so more straps,
of varying lengths up to 2 feet. At the ends of these straps are small metal
rings, upon which many different devices can be affixed; tools can be hung,
climbing daggers fixed, and suchlike. The principal uses of the harness are as
follows:
<P></P>
(i) If the thief is climbing a wall using a rope, the rope can be run through
one or more of the rings of the harness removing any chance of falling from
letting go of the rope.
<P></P>
(ii) Once the thief has reached the point where he hopes to effect a break-in,
two of the straps can be fixed to either side of him (usually with climbing
daggers, or perhaps with wedges in a window frame, etc). This provides the thief
with a firm base and allows him the free use of his hands to open a lock, cut
glass, check for traps, and for similar actions.
<P></P>
Imaginative thieves will be able to think up many other uses for this handy
and versatile piece of equipment.
