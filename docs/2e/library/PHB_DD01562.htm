physical activity for twice as long as a normal character before becoming
subject to the effects of fatigue and exhaustion. In those cases where extreme
endurance is required, a successful proficiency check must be made. Note that this
proficiency does not enable a character to extend the length of time that he can
remain unaffected by a lack of food or water.
