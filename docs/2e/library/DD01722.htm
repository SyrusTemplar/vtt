<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The <I>saving throw</I> is a die roll that gives a chance, however slim, that the character or
creature finds some way to save himself from certain destruction (or at least lessen
the damage of a successful attack).
<P></P>
More often than not, the saving throw represents an instinctive act on the
part of the character--diving to the ground just as a fireball scorches the group,
blanking the mind just as a mental battle begins, blocking the worst of an
acid spray with a shield. The exact action is not important--DMs and players can
think of lively and colorful explanations of why a saving throw succeeded or
failed. Explanations tailored to the events of the moment enhance the excitement
of the game.
