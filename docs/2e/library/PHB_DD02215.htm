By the use of this spell, the priest can transfer a limited number and
selection of his currently memorized spells, and the ability to cast them, to another
person. Only nonspellcasters (including rangers under 8th level and paladins
under 9th level) can receive this bestowal; the <I>imbue with spell ability</I> enchantment does not function for those belonging to spellcasting classes,
for unintelligent monsters, nor for any individual with less than 1 full Hit Die.
In addition, the person thus imbued must have a Wisdom score of 9 or higher.
Only priest spells of an informational or defensive nature or a <I>cure light wounds</I> spell can be transferred. Transferring any other spell type negates the
entire attempt, including any allowable spells that were chosen. Higher level
persons can receive more than one spell at the priest's option:

The transferred spell's variable characteristics (range, duration, area of
effect, etc.) function according to the level of the priest originally imbuing the
spell.
<P></P>
A priest who casts <I>imbue with spell ability</I> upon another character loses the number of 1st- and 2nd-level spells he has
imbued until the recipient uses the transferred spells or is slain. For example,
a 7th-level priest with five 1st- and four 2nd-level spells imbues a
10th-level fighter with a <I>cure light wounds</I> spell and a <I>slow poison</I> spell. The cleric now can have only four 1st-level spells memorized until the
cure is cast and only three 2nd-level spells until the <I>slow poison</I> is cast, or until the fighter is killed. In the meantime, the priest remains
responsible to his ethos for the use to which the spell is put.
<P></P>
The material components for this spell are the priest's holy symbol, plus some
minor item from the recipient that is symbolic of his profession (a lockpick
for a thief, etc.). This item, and any material component for the imbued spell,
is consumed when the <I>imbue with spell ability</I> spell is cast.
