<P></P>
<B>Specialty:</B> Riddler/Intellect.
<P></P>
<B>Qualifications:</B> Riddlemasters must have an Intelligence of 15 or more. Their other ability
scores are standard. Gnomes can rise to become 8th-level Riddlemasters. Halflings
can advance up to 9th level.
<P></P>
<B>Introduction:</B> <I>Yes, I am Retean, the Riddlemaster, mastermind of enigmas and games. I can
solve any riddle and complete any puzzle. Pay the price and watch me twice.
<P></P>
As a Riddlemaster, my mind is constantly in motion. I'm wiser than most
clerics, and smarter than most sages. Always thinking, always plotting, always alert.
<P></P>
When I encounter someone, I analyze him, evaluate his value to myself, and act
accordingly. When I enter a tavern I don't just grab the nearest chair.
Instead, I scan the room, select the most advantageous seat, and then evaluate the
fare as I decide what to have. None of my decisions are made without deliberate,
conscious thought.
<P></P>
Yet, I can be entertaining as well. I love to pose questions and riddles. For
example:
<P></P>
</I>If the world were round,
<P></P>
And you stood on the ground,
<P></P>
How many places could you stand . . .
<P></P>
Walk south 20 leagues, east 20 leagues, north 20 leagues
<P></P>
and end up hand in hand.
<P></P>
<I> The answer is not the north pole, but &quot;One.&quot; True, the North Pole is the only
place where you can do this, but I asked, &quot;how many places,&quot; not which places.
<P></P>
And now, as I have summed up your worth to me, I must be off to a new
challenge.
<P></P>
</I> <B>Description:</B> Riddles, rhymes, and puzzles are the medium of the Riddlemaster. These
characters look upon life as an intricate and challenging puzzle to be solved. Their
seemingly strange ways cause many a commoner to label them crazy (much like the
Jester). However, Riddlemasters are exceptionally intelligent, and their minds
work on a level above that of the common man.
<P></P>
Riddlemasters devote their entire intellect to maximizing favorable outcomes
for themselves and their friends. Some believe that Riddlemasters are just
extraordinarily lucky, but this is not the case. Riddlemasters are always
considering the environment around them, being sure to stand in the most favorable
places, socializing with the most advantageous people, asking the best questions, and
so on. They seek to develop the supreme mind.
<P></P>
To flaunt their skills, Riddlemasters often speak in riddles or rhymes,
causing others to stop and think in order to understand them. Riddlemasters love to
pose questions, in the form of riddles, to everyday people. These riddles are
carefully constructed and often conceal lessons or observations that apply to the
Riddlemasters' audience.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> Each Riddlemaster applies his intellect in a different way. Evil
Riddlemasters seek to demean and put down others in order to rise above them. Good
Riddlemasters make their way through society attempting to educate the &quot;less
fortunate.&quot; Others simply travel around, enjoying the sport of poking fun at others while
advancing their own intellectual understanding.
<P></P>
Traveling Riddlemasters are most common, as their unique ways often irritate
others, forcing them to maintain a mobile lifestyle. Adventuring Riddlemasters
enjoy the supreme tests of judgment and intelligence that must be passed in
order to survive perilous quests. Besides this, their input on decisions is nearly
invaluable. Of course, some party members may find their manner difficult to
put up with.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> Few Riddlemasters have a secondary skill, as they have spent their time in
intellectual pursuits. Those who do are most likely Gamblers, Jewelers, or
Trader/Barterers.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Riddlemasters enjoy finesse weapons over those that require simple brawn.
They can become proficient in the blowgun, bow, crossbow, dagger, dart, hand axe,
javelin, knife, quarterstaff, sling, spear, staff sling, short sword, or whip.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonuses:</I> Artistic Ability (riddles), Languages (modern), Poetry, Reading/Writing. <I>Suggested:</I> Appraising, Blind-fighting, Direction Sense, Gaming, Heraldry, Musical
Instrument, Navigation, Reading Lips, Singing, Weather Sense, Ventriloquism.
<P></P>
<B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Standard.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B>
<P></P>
<I>Probable Path:</I> Riddlemasters can use their great intellects to make analytical decisions.
When a decision must be made concerning multiple options (<I>e.g.,</I> which hallway to proceed down, which door to open first, which opponent to
attack first in order to achieve some goal, etc.), the Riddlemaster can use his
intellect to help make the decision. In such cases, the DM secretly rolls an
Intelligence check for the Riddlemaster, with a penalty equal to the number of
previous probable path decisions made that day (representing mental fatigue). If
the roll succeeds, the DM tells the player all significant clues that the
Riddlemaster might know or observe. If there are no clues, no information is gained--
Riddlemasters aren't lucky, they're just very intelligent.
<P></P>
If the roll is a natural 20, the information gained is misleading.
<P></P>
Unless a given situation changes somehow, using this ability multiple times in
the same situation gives identical results.
<P></P>
<I>Riddles/Puzzles:</I> If any adventure includes an actual riddle or puzzle that the players must
solve, the player of the Riddlemaster can make twice as many attempts to solve
the riddle or puzzle as is normally allowed. For example, an adventure might
include an encounter in which the party runs into a sphinx. The sphinx may demand
the answer to a riddle in exchange for safe passage. In this situation, if the
Riddlemaster gives the answer, the player can actually make two guesses, and if
either is correct, the sphinx is satisfied.
<P></P>
The same thing applies if the party comes across a room with a tiled floor
that must be crossed in a specific sequence. The Riddlemaster is allowed to make
one free mistake. Only on his second mistake does the character suffer any
hazardous consequences.
<P></P>
If a problem has a time limit, the Riddlemaster has twice the allotted time to
solve it.
<P></P>
A special use of solving riddles and puzzles occurs when a Riddlemaster
attempts to understand a newly discovered spell. The Riddlemaster has a +10% bonus to
his roll to learn spells (to a maximum of 95%).
<P></P>
Furthermore, the Riddlemaster gains the ability to use any written magical
item at 8th level, instead of 10th level.
<P></P>
<I>Common Sense:</I> To signify the common sense a Riddlemaster has at his disposal, Riddlemasters
gain certain benefits. Although these benefits are similar to those of the
Jester kit, they are not luck, but rather a result of intellectual calculations
made by the Riddlemaster.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> The Riddlemaster has a +1 adjustment to his Armor Class.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> A Riddlemaster receives a +1 (or 5%) bonus to many die rolls, including saving
throws, individual initiative, attacks rolls, damage rolls, proficiency
checks, thief skill checks, ability checks, and all ability-based rolls (bend bards,
system shock, etc. ), except for resurrection survival.
<P></P>
The only die rolls that common sense doesn't affect are surprise, initial
character generation rolls, hit die rolls, resurrection survival, and monster
damage rolls.
<P></P>
<I>Riddling and Rhyming:</I> By chanting certain riddles and rhymes, a Riddlemaster can influence an
audience's reactions. This ability functions in all ways as the True Bard's
influence reactions ability.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> None.
