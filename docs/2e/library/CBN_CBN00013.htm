</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Necromancers do pay a price for their devotion to the Art. Because of the
concentration in necromancy, they forgo all training in the schools of Illusion and
Enchantment/Charm. As a result, they cannot cast spells from these neglected
schools, unless the spell also falls under the jurisdiction of the six
permissible schools. Consider the 6th-level spell <I>enchant an item</I>, for example. Although it belongs to
<P></P>
Enchantment/Charm school, the spell may be learned by a necromancer since it
is also taught in the school of Invocation.
<P></P>
Of course, necromancers do have a more difficult time with studying spells
outside the Art for the first time (–15% chance to learn spells from permissible
schools except necromancy). However, despite all these restrictions, the
necromancer has a huge potential repertoire of spells at hand, limited only by the
character’s intelligence and diligence at spell research. Appendix 1 lists many
spells available to necromancers, arranged by level and application.
