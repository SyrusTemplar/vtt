<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ring of Spell Turning:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This ring distorts the three normal dimensions, causing many spells cast at
the wearer to rebound upon the spellcaster. Sometimes, a spell's entire effect is
turned against the caster; sometimes, a portion of the effect rebounds.
<P></P>
Some spells are immune from the effects of a <I>ring of spell turning:</I>
<P></P>
1. Spells that affect an area, and which are not cast directly at the ring
wearer, are not turned by the ring.
<P></P>
2. Spells that are delivered by touch are not turned.
<P></P>
3. Magic contained in devices (rods, staves, wands, rings, and other items)
that are triggered without spellcasting are not turned. A scroll spell is <I>not</I> considered a device.
<P></P>
When a spell is cast at an individual wearing a <I>ring of spell turning,</I> 1d10 is rolled and the result is multiplied by 10. This score indicates what
percentage of the spell has been turned back upon its caster.
<P></P>
Once the spell is turned, the effects must be determined. If the spell
normally allows a saving throw, the intended target (the one wearing the ring) gains
an automatic plus equal to the number rolled on the turning die. The caster
receives a bonus equal to the number rolled on the turning die. The caster receives
a bonus equal to the number rolled on this die subtracted from 10. For
example, a <I>charm person</I> spell is cast at a character wearing a <I>ring of spell turning.</I> A 7 is rolled on the die, turning back 70% of the effect. The ring-wearer
gains a +7 to his saving throw; the caster has a +3.
<P></P>
A saving throw is also allowed for spells which normally do not have one if
20% to 80% of the effect is turned. The saving throw adjustment is calculated as
given above. No further adjustments are made for race, magical items, or any
other condition including existing spells. To save, the character must have a
modified die roll of 20 or greater. If the saving throw is made, the effect of the
spell is negated. For example, an illusionist casts a <I>maze</I> spell at a fighter wearing a <I>ring of spell turning.</I> The spell normally allows no saving throw, but the ring turns 70% of the
effect. The fighter is allowed a saving throw with a +7 modifier. The illusionist
must also save, gaining only a +3. The fighter's die roll is 15, which saves
(15+7 = 22); the illusionist's die roll is a 16 which, while close, fails (16+3 =
19). The illusionist becomes trapped in his own <I>maze</I> spell.
<P></P>
Once a spell is turned, the effects are divided proportionately between the
two targets. If the spell causes damage, determine the damage normally and then
assess the amount to each according to the percentage determined, rounding
fractions to the nearest whole number. If a spell caused 23 points of damage, and
30% of it was turned, the intended victim would suffer 16 points of damage, while
the caster would suffer 7. Durations are affected in a similar manner. In the
above case, the spell duration would be 30% of its normal length for one
character and 70% for the other. The effect of permanent spells for both characters
remains unchanged.
<P></P>
Some spells affect a certain number of levels. When one of these is aimed at
the ring wearer, the spell must be able to affect as many levels as the wearer
and the spellcaster combined. If this condition is fulfilled, then the procedure
above applies.
<P></P>
If the spellcaster and spell recipient both wear <I>spell turning rings</I> a resonating field is set up, and one of the following results will take
place:
