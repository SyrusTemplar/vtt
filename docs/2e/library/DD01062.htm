<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Talisman of Zagy:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A talisman of this sort appears exactly the same as a <I>stone of controlling earth elementals.</I> Its powers are quite different, however, and are dependent upon the Charisma
of the individual holding the talisman. Whenever a character touches a <I>talisman of Zagy,</I> a reaction check is made as if the individual were meeting another creature.
<P></P>
If a hostile reaction result is obtained, the device will act as a <I>stone of weight,</I> although discarding it or destroying it results only in 5d6 points of damage
and the disappearance of the talisman.
<P></P>
If a neutral reaction results, the talisman will remain with the character for
5d6 hours, or until a <I>wish</I> is made upon it, whichever first occurs, and it will then disappear.
<P></P>
If a friendly reaction result is obtained, the character will find it
impossible to be rid of the talisman for as many months as he has points of Charisma.
<P></P>
The device will grant one <I>wish</I> for every six points of the character's Charisma. It will also grow warm and
throb whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or magical
trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses will be of no
avail.)
<P></P>
Regardless of which reaction result is obtained, when its time period expires,
the talisman will disappear. A base 10,000 gp diamond will remain in its stead.
