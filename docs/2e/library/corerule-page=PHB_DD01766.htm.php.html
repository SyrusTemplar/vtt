Before a character can do anything in the dungeon or the wilderness, he has to
be able to see what he is doing. If a character can't see a target, his
chances of hitting it are very small. If he can't see, he can't read a scroll or a
large “Keep Out” sign on the wall. In the AD&amp;D game, characters can see set
distances and often by fantastic means that defy logic.
