<P></P>
   Following is a list of standard equipment owned (or at least desired) by most
paladins. Usually, paladins purchase this equipment with their own funds. A
frugal paladin tries to maintain his possessions in top condition so he seldom has
to invest in replacements.
<P></P>
<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
   All types of armor are available to the paladin. Given a choice, most prefer
the protection and prestige of full plate. However, because of the expense of
plate armor, some opt for banded or splint, while others settle for the cheaper
and readily available chain mail. Leather, studded leather, and padded—including
magical versions—are generally avoided, as these armor types tend to be
associated with characters of lesser status. A discriminating paladin may prefer to
wear ordinary scale mail rather <I>studded leather +2.
<P></P>
</I>   In a typical medieval campaign world, paladins favor three armor types:
hauberk/helmet combinations, chain, and plate.
<P></P>
   <B>Hauberk and helmet.</B> Destitute paladins, those from primitive cultures, or those just beginning
their careers sometimes wear only a chain mail hauberk (a single piece that
covers the chest) and a helmet. The paladin often supervises the construction of the
hauberk or makes it himself, coiling wire around a rod, then cutting it down
the side to make rings. He flattens the rings with a hammer, them rivets them
together in the shape of a knee-length coat with a hood to cover the head. The
helmet is usually round or cone-shaped, open in the front. The hauberk-helmet
combination is cheaper than chain mail, but less protective, with an Armor Class
of 7.
<P></P>
<B>   Chain mail.</B> A hauberk supplemented with leggings and arm coverings becomes a complete set
of chain mail (AC 5). A visor may be added to the helmet to protect the face.
While inexpensive and relatively light, chain mail has its drawbacks. The
weight of chain mail is distributed unevenly on the body, straining the shoulders in
particular. Even the strongest paladin will feel fatigued after wearing chain
mail for more than a day. At the DM's option, any character wearing chain mail
for more than 24 hours straight suffers a –2 penalty to all attack rolls until
he removes it and rests for a few hours.
<P></P>
   At least once a week, iron chain mail must be oiled and polished, a process
that can take the better part of an afternoon. Failure to properly care for chain
mail results in rust (and a reduction of one level of AC for each month of
neglect).
<P></P>
   <B>Plate.</B> Plate mail (AC 3) adds a breast plate, back plate, and strips of metal to
areas of the body underprotected by chain mail, such as the knees and elbows.
Metal sheets called <I>pauldrons</I> protect the spaces between the arms and the chest. <I>Epaulieres</I> (shoulder guards) protect the upper body; <I>gauntlets</I> (metal gloves) protect the hands.
<P></P>
   High-level paladins occasionally decorate plate mail with gold or silver trim
and fasten small jewels to the helmet or the backs of the gauntlets. These
extravagances are generally compatible with the paladin's ethos, so long as they're
intended to reflect the paladin's station and aren't used to flaunt wealth.
Heraldic symbols may be etched or painted on any section of the armor.
<P></P>
   Plate mail requires polishing and oiling, but because it consists of solid
sections rather than tiny rings, it's more resistant to rust. Though heavier than
chain mail, plate mail fits better and is more comfortable, making fatigue less
a factor. The illustration in this chapter identifies various pieces of a
paladin's plate mail armor, along with the basic pieces of mount barding.

<P></P>
<P></P>
   Most paladins carry medium shields, which offer maximum protection against
front and flank attacks and are light enough to be carried on horseback. Made of
wood and covered in thick leather, the shield is shaped like a triangle with a
round top and pointed bottom. Its surface curves inward. The shield extends
about 4-5 feet from top to bottom and hangs from the paladin's neck by a strap. He
grips it in his left hand (or right hand, if he's left-handed) with a second
strap secured to the shield's inner surface.
<P></P>
   Some paladins carry oblong, rectangular, round or even pentagonal shields.
Shields may be decorated with gold or silver trim, dotted with precious jewels,
emblazoned with heraldic symbols, or painted in bright colors.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
   A paladin may master any weapon, but most feel unarmed without a sword (long,
two-handed, bastard, or short, in that order of preference), a lance (medium or
heavy, depending on the size of the mount), and a dagger. A paladin typically
keeps his sword in a wooden scabbard covered in leather, strapped to the left
side of his belt (or to the right side if left-handed). The dagger hangs from
his belt on the opposite side of his scabbard.
<P></P>
   Other weapons favored by paladins include the horseman's flail, horseman's
mace, horseman's pick, battle axe, and scimitar. Paladins tend to avoid using
missile weapons, as they're difficult to use effectively on horseback.
<P></P>
   A jousting lance, though desirable, may be too expensive. Instead, a paladin
may opt for a lance cup, a blunted cap of wood that fits over the end of an
ordinary lance, making it suitable for tournaments. Lance cups, however, are
notoriously undependable; there is a 5% chance per joust (roll 1 on 1d20) that the
cup will detach and fall off. When this occurs, the officials interrupt the joust
and the contestants must start over. A jouster who repeatedly loses his lance
cup may risk disqualification from the tournament.

<P></P>
<P></P>
   When choosing clothes, the paladin strives for both utility and elegance. He
favors bold colors (blue, red, green and violet) and, when he can afford them,
rich fabrics (silk and velvet in particular). Because a paladin is often judged
by his appearance, spending money on formal attire usually isn't considered an
ethos violation.
<P></P>
   An ideal wardrobe, which may be acquired a piece at a time over the course of
a paladin's career, consists of the following:
<P></P>
• Two loose-fitting silk or linen shirts with full sleeves.
<P></P>
• Two pairs breeches or trousers, made of wool, cotton, or linen, tailored to
fit tightly to the legs (loose-fitting breeches tend to be associated with
peasants and commoners). The breeches are usually ankle-length and brightly colored.
<P></P>
• Armor lining (made of soft leather or padded fabric, worn beneath chain mail
to prevent chafing.
<P></P>
• Two pairs of cotton undergarments.
<P></P>
• Two pairs of silken hose and garters.
<P></P>
• A pair of riding boots.
<P></P>
• A pair of leather shoes, usually pointed at the toes and fastened at the
ankle with straps and buckles.
<P></P>
• Two knee-length tunics, usually sleeveless, slipped over the head. Tunics
may be decorated with colorful patterns of stripes and circles, and possibly
feathers or small gems.
<P></P>
• A surcoat (outer tunic), either sleeveless or head. The surcoat is usually
lined with rabbit, squirrel, or other light fur, and padded at the shoulders.
Tassels, ribbons, and brocade are common.
<P></P>
• A lightweight mantle (a sleeveless coat made from an oval piece of cloth)
for the spring and summer, made of cotton or silk. The garment is rectangular or
semicircular in shape, wrapped around the body, and secured at the neck with a
chain or buckle.
<P></P>
• A heavy winter mantle lined with beaver, fox, or other thick fur.
<P></P>
• A full cape made of wool, cotton, or lambskin, fastened around the neck with
a chain or leather strap. High-level paladins may prefer a silken cape in
black, blue, red, or violet, lined with red or black velvet.
<P></P>
• A wide leather belt with a metal buckle.
<P></P>
• A wool, cotton, or felt cap.
<P></P>
• A ceremonial coif (a tight-fitting cap covering the hair and ears, tied
beneath the chin) made of linen or silk, and decorated with embroidery, feathers,
or golden lace. A ceremonial coif is often required for state banquets and other
formal occasions. The equivalent for females is called a <I>wimple</I>.
<P></P>
   A conscientious paladin should also consider including the following items as
part of his standard gear. These are in addition to lanterns, rope, and other
equipment necessary for long trips or specific quests.
<P></P>
• Two cotton or woolen towels (one for washing, one to use as a mat for
eating).
<P></P>
• Formal dinnerware, including eating utensils, a cup, a plate, and a goblet.
Because paladins may have to furnish their own service at formal events, they
should buy quality items made of silver, crystal, and porcelain.
<P></P>
• Complete tack for the mount, including bit, bridle, harness, horseshoes,
saddle, and full barding.
<P></P>
• Two heavy blankets, one used for a bed, the other to cover the mount at
night.
<P></P>
• A mirror (necessary for grooming).
<P></P>
<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
   Female paladins are free to wear all of the above clothing (assuming no
cultural reasons to the contrary). For formal occasions, a female paladin may instead
wear a floor-length tunic called a <I>kirtle</I>, which fits snugly above the hips and billows around the legs. A surcoat and
cloak may be worn as outer garments. Females may also wear hose above the knee,
secured by garters or tied with ribbons. Footwear is similar for males and
females, though the kirtles conceal all but the toes.
