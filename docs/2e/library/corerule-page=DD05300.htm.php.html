Only the Composite Short Bow, Short Bow, Daikyu (from this supplement's <I>Equipment</I> chapter), and Crossbows may be used from horseback. The Long Bow and
Composite Long Bow may not be.

Firing a bow from the back of a still horse (one which is not running) is done
at a –1 penalty to attack rolls.

Firing from the back of a walking or trotting horse is done at a –2 penalty to
attack rolls.
<P></P>
Firing from the back of a galloping horse is done at a –4 penalty to attack
rolls.

In some barbarian tribes, especially those who inhabit wild-open plains, every
warrior knows Riding for the tribe's favorite riding animal and Specializes in
Composite Short Bow. This makes them very, very dangerous opponents in a
cavalry engagement.
