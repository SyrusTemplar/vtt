When this spell is cast, it brings forth a large, flaming chariot pulled by
two fiery horses from the elemental plane of Fire. These appear in a clap of
thunder amid a cloud of smoke. The vehicle moves at 24 on the ground, 48 flying,
and can carry the caster and up to seven other creatures of man-size or less. The
passengers must be touched by the caster to protect them from the flames of
the chariot. Creatures other than the caster and his designated passengers
sustain 2d4 points of fire damage each round if they come within 5 feet of the horses
or chariot. Such creatures suffer no damage if they evade the area by rolling
successful saving throws vs. petrification, with Dexterity adjustments.
<P></P>
The caster controls the chariot by verbal command, causing the flaming steeds
to stop or go, walk, trot, run or fly, and turn left or right as he desires.
Note that the chariot of Sustarre is a physical manifestation and can sustain
damage. The vehicle and steeds are struck only by magical weapons or by water (one
quart of which inflicts 1 point of damage). They are Armor Class 2, and each
requires 30 points of damage to dispel. Naturally, fire has no effect upon
either the vehicle or its steeds, but magical fires other than those of the chariot
can affect the riders. Other spells, such as a successful<I> dispel magic</I> or<I> holy word</I>, will force the chariot back to its home plane, without its passengers. The
chariot can be summoned only once per week.

The material components are a small piece of wood, two holly berries, and a
fire source at least equal to a torch.
