This spell allows the wizard to raise up the spirit of a dead human or
demihuman, which may answer questions put to it by those present at the summoning. Of
course, the questioners must speak the same language as the dead creature.
<P></P>
Summoning a dead spirit is far from a certain or trouble-free enterprise. The
base chance that a spirit will answer the summons is 50% + 1% for each
experience level of the wizard casting the spell. This chance of success also depends
on the authority of the caster in the spirit world, the length of time the
subject has been dead, and the specific time of day during the casting (see <A HREF="CBN00103.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="CBN00103.htm">Table 11</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">).
<P></P>
Regardless of actual penalties or bonuses, the chance of success never drops
below 5% or rises above 95%. If the spell fails, there is always the chance that
the summoning will attract the attention of some other (potentially hostile)
spirit or undead creature, either from the netherworld or the general vicinity
of the caster. The chances of summoning a malicious undead are 5%, cumulative
with every failed attempt by the same caster. The DM may roll on the table for
the clerical spell <I>summon undead</I>. Note that this spell in no way protects the wizard (or those present at the
casting) from the attacks of inadvertently summoned undead.
<P></P>
If the summoning is successful, the desired spirit slowly rises from the
ground before the caster. The spirit’s willingness to answer questions will first
determine the effectiveness of the spell. If the spirit is of a different
alignment than the caster or formerly had more hit dice than the caster’s current
level of experience, the shade is entitled to a saving throw vs. spells to resist
the interrogation.
<P></P>
Provided that the spirit is agreeable, it can answer no more than one question
for every three levels of the caster. Summoned spirits tend to be evasive and
cryptic when questioned by the living. In general, their knowledge is limited
to what they knew while alive. A spirit may also be called upon to answer
specific questions about the near future, regarding actions undertaken before the
next nightfall. Questions and pre
<P></P>
dictions about future events are subject to the same conditions and
limitations as the priest spell <I>augury</I>.
