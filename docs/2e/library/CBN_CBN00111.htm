<I>Death shroud</I> draws upon the Negative Material Plane to surround the caster in a dark and
shadowy aura of life-draining energy. While the spellcaster suffers no
ill-effects from this baneful radiance, it may have dire consequences for anyone who
comes into contact with the aura.
<P></P>
The <I>death shroud</I> can be used actively in offense and passively in defense. In combat, the
wizard may activate the deadly power of the spell by touching a victim (requiring a
successful attack roll). Any creature touched must immediately save vs. death
magic with a –4 penalty. If the roll is successful, the victim is unharmed. If
the save is failed, a black haze forms around the victim, draining 20% of his
or her current hit points each round until the unfortunate individual dies at
the end of the fifth round. The <I>death shroud</I> also serves as a passive ward or protection for the caster. Anyone who
touches the wizard or attempts to strike him or her with any hand-held object or
melee weapon must make a saving throw vs. death magic (with no penalties) or be
stricken by the death shroud in a similar manner.
<P></P>
The following spells remove the <I>death shroud</I> from an afflicted individual: <I>cure critical wounds, heal, limited wish, wish</I>, or a successful <I>dispel magic</I>. Lesser curing spells and healing potions delay death only by one round.
Multiple applications of these spells or potions may prolong a victim’s life until
the duration of the spell expires. The spell may also be ended prematurely by
killing or successfully employing dispel magic on the caster (this immediately
releases all creatures afflicted by the spell).
<P></P>
The <I>death shroud</I> remains in effect until the wizard has successfully attacked or been attacked
by a number of creatures equal to his or her current level (or the spell’s
maximum duration of two rounds per level has elapsed). Undead are not affected by
this spell. In fact, if an undead creature is attacked by a <I>death shroud</I>, it immediately gains 1 HD, and the wizard must save vs. death magic or
suffer the effects of the <I>death shroud</I> him- or herself.
<P></P>
This dreadful spell is known only to a select cadre of necromancers who
purportedly learned it from a mysterious, bronze-bound book of extraplanar origin.
The warding requires the following material components: crushed black opal and
diamond (worth 5,000 gp), dust from a corporeal undead with strong ties to the
Negative Material Plane (such as a vampire or wight), and a hunk of smoky quartz.
These ingredients are consumed in the casting.
