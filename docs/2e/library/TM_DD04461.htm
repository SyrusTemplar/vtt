<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Amulet of Magic Resistance:</B> This powerful amulet grants the wearer a degree of magic resistance ranging
from 5% to 30%. The level of magic resistance is determined when the amulet is
found by rolling 1d6 and multiplying the result by 5. Any time the amulet is
worn and a spell is cast at the wearer, the wearer is allowed a percentile roll to
avoid the full effects of the spell.
<P></P>
Only 50% of all such amulets confer magic resistance against all spells. The
remaining 50% extend magic resistance only to spells of 1st through 6th levels.
Such amulets have no effect on spells more powerful than these. The DM should
secretly determine this information when the ring is discovered.
<P></P>
All such amulets, regardless of the degree of resistance conferred, are
delicate magical structures. If the wearer rolls for magic resistance at any time and
the roll is 95-00, this fragile item has been disrupted and the amulet
shatters into useless scrap.
