Psionic powers can be used by any character class, though one class
specializes in the use of psionics: the psionicist. Wild talents are a subclassification
within other character classes. These characters possess one or two psionic
powers. Their main vocation is that of their class. For instance, a priest could
have a psionic ability or two, but he relies primarily on the skills of his
class. A psionicist, on the other hand, relies almost entirely on his psionic
gifts. The differences between the two types of psionic characters are explained in
the section that follows.
