<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Stone of Good Luck (Luckstone):</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This magical stone is typically a bit of rough polished agate or similar
mineral. Its possessor gains a +1 (+5% where applicable) on all dice rolls involving
factors such as saving, slipping, dodging, etc.â€”whenever dice are rolled to
find whether the character suffers from some adverse happening. This luck does
not affect attack and damage rolls or spell failure dice.
<P></P>
Additionally, the <I>luckstone</I> gives the possessor a +/- 1% to 10% (at owner's option) on rolls for
determination of magical items or diversion of treasure. The most favorable results
will always be gained with a <I>stone of good luck.</I>
