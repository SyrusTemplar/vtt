<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Throughout the ages, friendly fire has been a significant threat on the
battlefield. In the <I>Player's Option </I>combat system, the shorter combat round means that archers can-t wait to pick
and choose their shots. They have to fire or hold their fire in an instant.
<P></P>
A melee is defined as any situation in which one creature threatens another.
Firing or throwing missiles at either of the two engaged creatures requires the
shooter to roll to see which figure he actually attacks. All creatures that are
threatened or threatening one another in the same group are included, so the
archer is guaranteed of at least firing at the right engagement.
<P></P>
To determine the actual target, assign each Man-sized target 1 point on a die.
Small-sized targets get 1/2 a point, Large targets 2 points, Huge targets 4
points, and Gargantuan targets 6 points.
