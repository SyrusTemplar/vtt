By using this spell, the caster can transform one musical instrument into
another of similar size and equal value. Any hand-held instrument can be altered
into any other hand-held instrument. However, in order to obtain a large
instrument, such as a base harp, organ, or any other instrument that is too large or
heavy to be easily carried, the spellcaster must start with an equally large
instrument.
<P></P>
In any event, the value of the new instrument is identical to the original. A
golden recorder will generate a silver plated lute, a child's drum will
generate a nonfunctional lyre, <I>etc.</I>
<P></P>
Bards use this spell to save both money and equipment carried. It is a lot
cheaper to buy a single instrument and alter it when another is needed than to buy
every instrument that might be required. This also saves a lot of space in
one's backpack.
<P></P>
If the instrument the bard wishes to alter is being carried or played by
another character, a successful attack roll against the opponent's Armor Class must
be made in order to touch the instrument.
