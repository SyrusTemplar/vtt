<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Rod of Terror:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This rod is a +2 magical weapon capable of inflicting 1d6 +3 points of damage
per hit. Furthermore, the wielder can expend a charge to envelop himself in a
terrifying aura. His clothes and appearance are transformed into an illusion of
darkest horror, such that all within 30 feet who view him must roll successful
saving throws vs. rods or be struck motionless with terror. Those who succeed
on their save suffer a -1 penalty to their morales and must make immediate
morale checks. However, each time the rod is used, there is a 20% chance the wielder
will permanently lose 1 point from his Charisma score.
