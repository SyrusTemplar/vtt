Specialists in Schools of Philosophy
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> A wizard specializing in a school of philosophy adheres to the general rules
above. Depending on his choice of school, the specialist will have anywhere from
one to three opposition schools. Each specialty has different race and ability
score requirements, reflecting the unique nature of each field of study. See <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03389.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03389.htm.php.html">Table 1</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> : Philosophy Specialist Requirements.
<P></P>
<I>In The Complete Wizard’s Handbook</I>, each specialist received several additional abilities related to his chosen
field at high levels. These abilities have been reworked, and specialists now
receive them much earlier in their careers. They are optional; if the DM decides
that they aren’t appropriate, the additional powers are unavailable for PC
specialist wizards.
