Characters who are standing free of the melee and aren?t endangered by any
adjacent monsters are considered clear. (The character can still be attacked by
missile fire, charged, or have a spell thrown at him, of course.) As long as a
character is not in the threatened spaces of any enemy figure, he is clear. The
character?s choice of combat action is unrestricted.
<P></P>
Characters who are clear are allowed to turn to threaten a figure that moves
up to them in the course of a combat round. The character doesn?t have to do
this; he can ignore the danger. The character only gets this free facing change
once per round, so he can elect to threaten the first figure that moves up to him
or to wait upon the arrival of a more dangerous enemy.
