Once creation of the world and universe are established, the DM can move on to
the propagation of the gods. In other words, once the setting is in place, the
cast of gods gets larger and larger.
<P></P>
Naturally, the DM can always do this the other way around. Perhaps all the
gods were in place before they decided to create the world. There's nothing wrong
with this choice; it's simply backward from the way the best-known Earth
mythologies operated.
<P></P>
Regardless, unless the DM is creating a monotheistic faith (one dedicated to
only one deity), he must now begin creating the other gods of the faith.
<P></P>
These gods could be children of the first great being. They could be that
being's creations instead. They could be representations of natural forces brought
to awareness and life by the catalyst of Creation. They could emerge from some
less wholesome process (for example, they could be created by the decay of the
body of the first great being, or could merely spring forth whole from its
corpse: One god from the bones, one from the brain, one from the heart, etc.).
<P></P>
Each god should have some special <I>attribute</I> , an area where he or she is dominant. Some can have several attributes. Such
attributes include Thought, Strength, War, Love, Craftsmanship, Earth, Sea,
Sky, Sailing, Farming, Hunting, and many, many others. Any activity that is
important to humans (or demihumans) can be an attribute for a god.
<P></P>
Not all these gods need to have been &quot;first-generation,&quot; or born to/created by
that first great being. Obviously, some should be. But they, too, can create
or become parents to other gods.
<P></P>
In some mythoi, the god of a particularly important attribute will have
children who bear lesser forms of that attribute. For instance, the god of Love might
have children who represent Passion, Marriage, Infatuation, and Unrequited
Love. The god of Sleep might have children who represent Dreams and Nightmares.
The god of Intellect might have children who represent Memory, Poetry, Song, and
Riddles or Puzzles.
