<I>
<P></P>
Rigid thinking</I> can be cast only upon a creature with Intelligence of 3 or greater. The
creature is allowed a saving throw to avoid the effects.
<P></P>
The creature affected by <I>rigid thinking</I> is in capable of performing any action other than the activity he is involved
in when the spell takes effect. The creature's mind simply cannot decide on
another course of action--it becomes frozen into a single thought and cannot
change even if new circumstances would suggest otherwise. Thus, a warrior fighting
a kobold will ignore the arrival of a beholder, and a thief picking a lock will
pay no heed to the arrival of three guards.
<P></P>
The affected creature does not mechanically repeat the action; he is not an
automaton. He will not continue to fire his bow at a dragon if he runs out of
arrows, but will choose another means of attacking the dragon to the exclusion of
all other activities.
<P></P>
A spellcaster in the process of casting a spell when <I>rigid thinking</I> takes effect will not attempt to repeat the spell (unless the spell has been
memorized more than once). The spellcaster will, however, devote his attention
to the target of that spell until his goal is met (e.g., if the caster were
attacking a creature, he would continue to direct attacks at that creature; if the
caster were trying to open a door, he would continue to work on the door until
it opens).
<P></P>
The spell expires when the creature accomplishes his goal (i.e., the kobold is
killed or the lock is opened) or when the duration of the spell has ended.
