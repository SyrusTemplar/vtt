<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">The Social Ranks System</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Rogues, fighters, wizards, and priests can come from any background?from
being the 10th son in a peasant family to the first-born of a noble house. As
such, they can be of any social rank.
<P></P>
If a campaign is set in a large kingdom?s capital, a character with the noble
kit could be a member of one of the nation?s rich, powerful families?perhaps
even the favored offspring of the rulers. His relatives, however, might not be
too happy that he spends so much time knee-deep in the filthy muck of dungeons,
hacking atrocious beasts to bits for a living. That is hardly a suitable ?noble?
image. Another character might have the barbarian kit, and the player must
decide how his rough and rugged fur-clad character came to be in a large city at
the time the campaign starts.
<P></P>
A character?s initial social rank should not limit his advancement in society.
A peasant hero might always feel uncomfortable when standing before his king.
But if his heroic deeds warrant such an appearance, he should be granted the
opportunity. The only limit on how high a character can rise in society?and in
social rank?is set by his actions.
<P></P>
Social rank is tied to many character kits. Players can take three approaches
to selecting a kit. A player can roll at random to determine his character?s
kit; simply pick a kit, then roll on the social rank table underneath that kit;
or, he can roll on the <A HREF="DD02968.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02968.htm">social rank table</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> below and see what kit possibilities open up for his character.
<P></P>
To determine social rank first, roll 2d6 on the chart below. Samples of people
who might fit into various classes follow. Some DMs might allow players to
choose a rank that fits their character concept.
