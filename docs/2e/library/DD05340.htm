The effects of armor on the characters' AC are already well-documented within
the game.
<P></P>
In the campaign, the only feature of the armor/AC system that tends to cause
trouble involves the shield. Remember that attacks to the character's rear are
made at the character's AC <I>without</I> the shield (unless he's wearing it slung across his back, of course); this is
something that is easy to forget. DMs, if they don't keep the information
written on a helpful record sheet, should ask their players: &quot;What's your AC from
the rear?&quot; when such incidents come up, not just &quot;What's your AC?&quot;
