<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Spy</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> In any campaign there is bound to be intrigue, conspiracies, and insidious
plots. Uncovering these secrets is the job of the spy. As the scout crosses
enemy lines and infiltrates dangerous wilderness areas to learn vital information,
so does the spy wend his way through all levels of society. He attends parties
or sits in smoky taverns, drinking, dancing, or gambling-all the while noting
who is speaking to whom, what is being discussed, (and what isn-t being
discussed), who-s present and who-s absent, and what are the latest rumors and gossip.
Spies often choose to become adventurers, as that profession is the perfect
cover. Few think twice when a new group of heroes comes into town. In most
campaigns, adventurers are just accepted-if not granted a few favors in case their
unique talents are ever needed. This allows spies to go almost anywhere without
arising suspicion.
<P></P>
If this kit is chosen, the player should discuss with the DM exactly who the
spy is supposed to be spying on, and who the spy-s employer is. It is possible
that the spy is between missions, or is seeking additional income as an
adventurer. Spies tend to be educated and versatile. Roll 2d6 to determine the social
rank of a spy character.

minimum Intelligence/Reason and Charisma/Appearance scores of 13. The spy kit is
barred to half-ogres, as well as any optional PC race that is size large (<A HREF="DD02903.htm#671c398c"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02903.htm#671c398c">restriction z</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> from the Other Races section of <A HREF="DD02901.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02901.htm">Chapter Three</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">), and thri-kreen.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Spies are only limited in weapon choice by their adventuring class. However,
depending on their cover identity, spies may be limited in the weapons they
carry. For example, a spy impersonating a wizard cannot bring his favorite bastard
sword along as part of the disguise. Many spies prefer small, easily
concealed, or easily disguised weapons (a walking cane can double as a club or hide a
thin blade). This lets spies defend themselves if they are discovered. Such
weapons include: club, dagger, knife, and darts. If the campaign involves much
courtly intrigue, -ceremonial? weapons such as various swords also qualify.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended nonweapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Disguise, forgery, dancing, etiquette, heraldry, riding, local history,
modern languages, herbalism, reading/writing, appraising, gaming, musical
instrument, reading lips, spellcraft.

appearing incongruous.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended traits:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Alertness, empathy, glibness, impersonation, light sleeper, lucky, music
(any), precise memory.

reaction rolls.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hindrances:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The foremost problem with being a spy is that if his cover identity is blown
and he is captured, the penalty is often death. It is also possible that old
foes may later determine the spy-s true identity and seek revenge against him.
