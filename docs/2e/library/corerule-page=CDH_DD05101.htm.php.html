<FONT SIZE="3">Standing stones are large, shaped stones that rise
from the ground to towering heights. In some cases, their presence in
a forest, on a bleak moor, or atop a lonely hill automatically
qualifies an area as a sacred grove, even if it lacks other natural
beauty. Druids may have erected the standing stones, or they may mark
a holy place that predates the druids' arrival in the area-- perhaps
a site sacred to prehuman peoples (elves, for instance) or
prehistoric tribes.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Though sometimes stones stand alone, they more often
join together to form various arrangements. A single standing stone
is called a <I>megalith</I>--either a shaped slab or a more natural,
tapering <I>obelisk</I>. Two shaped stones placed upright with a
third laid across their tops constitutes a <I>trilithon</I>. Several
megaliths or trilithons frequently form patterns, usually circles or
horseshoe shapes.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Individual stones may weigh 5 to 25 tons each and
stand 10 to 30 feet tall. A large circle may take a generation to
build, unless powerful earth magic or suitable monsters (treants,
earth elementals, or giants) help in the construction. Because druids
possess the necessary magic, they often create these monuments for
their sacred groves.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Standing stones fall into one of two categories:
magical and nonmagical.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Nonmagical Standing Stones</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Many standing stones have no innate magical
properties, although they may have been built by magic. In
&quot;awakened&quot; groves, these nonmagical stones may share in the
general magic of the grove. The DM decides on the purpose, type, and
number of stones.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Boundary Markers.</B> Stones can simply mark the
grove's borders, a common practice when a circle of trees is
inappropriate. Mountain druids, in particular, use stone circles to
mark borders.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Natural Observatory.</B> The stones might serve as
a primitive astronomical calculator (as in the case of Stonehenge),
their positions marking eclipses, equinoxes, and other important
solar and lunar dates whose exact times remain important for
religious reasons and for maintaining the agricultural calendar.
Usually one such astronomical circle of stones exists in every major
druidic domain. Creating such a circle requires two proficiencies:
astrology and engineering. In some cases, these circles are relics
left behind to mark the visits (and predict the eventual returns) of
spelljamming space druids.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Monuments. </B>The lives of particularly notable
historical figures can merit great megalith memorials. Sometimes
treasure or a body lies buried under the stone. In rare instances,
although the stone has no magic, the body beneath it rests in magical
suspended animation--think of King Arthur, waiting for Merlin to
awaken him.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Magical Standing Stones</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Magical standing stones can serve any of the
nonmagical variety's purposes. Lesser magical sacred groves
containing standing stones possess a 10% chance of having one with
magical powers. This chance increases to 20% for groves with five or
more stones, and 30% for groves with 25 or more stones. Standing
stones within greater groves have triple the chance of being magical.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Standing stones may become magical through association
with druidic rites, divine intervention, or via the normal process
used to create druidic magical items. DMs deciding that a stone has
magic either pick its powers from those described below or roll on
Table 6. Add a +1 bonus to rolls for standing stones that help form a trilithon.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Petrified Entity.</B> The magical stone is actually
a huge being--often a giant or titan--that has been so weathered and
overgrown with moss or ivy over the years its original humanoid form
is no longer discernable. It radiates magic and may return to life if
a <I>dispel magic</I> or <I>stone to flesh</I> spell succeeds.
Depending on its alignment and the reason it became petrified, the
creature may feel either grateful or hostile to its rescuer. A
petrified entity usually points to the work of dual-class wizard/druid.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Stone Guardian.</B> Once per day, the steward of
the grove can order the stone to come to life for one turn per level
of the druid. The animated stone fights as a 16 HD earth elemental,
but if it leaves the grove it reverts to a normal stone and may not
be reanimated until returned to the grove--a herculean task, since it
weighs several tons! If injured, the magical stone heals at a rate of
1 hit point per turn--within the grove only.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Peaceful Stones.</B> The standing stones exert a
calming influence on the earth. No <I>earthquake </I>spells may
succeed within a radius that measures (in feet from the center of the
stone or cluster) a distance equal to the number of stones in the
circle. Since no earthquakes or volcanic eruptions occur in this
area, peaceful stones often stand near volcanoes or faults. Removing
them could spell disaster for nearby forests and towns!</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Speaking Stones.</B> Any druid can cause any
standing stones in the grove to speak, per the stone tell spell.
Characters can use this power as often as desired, but the stones
speak for no more than three rounds per day. Stewards use this power
to learn whether intruders have visited the grove while they were
away; druids who find a strange grove could use it to become familiar
with the grove's history and keepers (if any).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Trilithon Gate.</B> Characters passing under the
stones may emerge from any other sacred grove in the world that also
has a trilithon gate, no matter how distant. Those who have a
particular gate in mind reach it; otherwise, characters come through
a random gate. Anyone can travel via trilithon gate only once per
day; it is impossible to go through and return again immediately.</FONT></P>
