<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Assassin</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> This kit is intended for evil aligned characters, as the act of killing for
pay cannot be justified as a good act. In any society there exists an element
that wishes to dispose of rivals, business competitors, and any others deemed to
be in the way. It is to this element that the assassin, a hired killer,
caters. Unlike simple warriors or soldiers, the assassin relies on anonymity and
surprise to earn his living. A successful assassin may not even be seen by his
target. Slipping out of the darkness or a crowd of friends, the assassin does his
dark deed and disappears.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Social ranks:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Assassins tend to be well-off, as their services are expensive. Further, they
often are educated, which helps them fit into different segments of society to
stalk their prey. Roll 2d6 to determine an assassin’s rank.
