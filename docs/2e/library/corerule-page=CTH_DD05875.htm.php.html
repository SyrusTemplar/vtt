Again, examples of complicated or tense, oppositional relationships can easily
be developed by the DM from the examples above. One group of merchants could
be trying desperately to fend off thievery, while a second faction argues for
accommodating thieves and paying them off. This leads to a major schism, with the
more principled merchants accusing the pragmatists of collusion with crime;
insults start to fly, then a few fists, then somebody's warehouse suffers a small
fire . . . Involving the PCs in what will fast become a triangular conflict
(two sets of merchants at each other's throats with the thieves gleefully
picking up the spoils from anyone they can get at) leads to endless adventure
possibilities.
