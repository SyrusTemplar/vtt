Although it is possible to become proficient in an entire group of weapons,
this doesn't mean a character can <I>specialize</I> in an entire group of weapons.
<P></P>
As before, each weapon specialization costs one Weapon Proficiency Slot in a
weapon the character is already proficient in. A character <I>can't </I>pay two points to be proficient in the Fencing Blades group and then another
two to specialize in the same group: He'd have to take one-slot Specializations<I> individually</I> for Dagger/Dirk, Knife/Stiletto, Main-gauche, Rapier, and Sabre.
<P></P>
Let's say a character wants to know how to use every type of blade ever made .
. . but he wants to be especially good with the Long Sword. As a first-level
Warrior, he receives four Weapon Proficiency Slots to start with. He spends
three to take Proficiency with the entire Blades broad group, and spends his fourth
to specialize in Long Sword. He has his wish: He can pick up and use any blade
weapon without penalty, but is particularly adept with the Long Sword.
<P></P>
Similarly, a character might wish to be proficient with all bows, and
especially good with the Composite Long Bow. He spends two weapon proficiency slots to
be proficient with the entire Bows tight group, and spends two more slots
(because it is more difficult to specialize in bows; see the Player's Handbook, <A HREF="PHB_DD01531.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01531.htm">page 52</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) to specialize in Composite Long Bow. This character is at a disadvantage
with any sort of weapon other than bows, but can use all bows, and is especially
good with the Composite Long Bow.

That's all you need to know now about the use of Weapon Proficiencies . . . as
they're used to buy proficiency and specialization with weapons. But there are
more things to use these proficiencies on, as you'll see as you proceed
through the chapter.
