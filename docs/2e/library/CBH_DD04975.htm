</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Acting
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Acting enables a character to skillfully portray various roles. Acting is most
often used as a form of entertainment; it can also be useful in aiding a
disguise. If both acting and disguise are known, the proficiency check for either is
made with a +1 bonus.
<P></P>
Proficiency checks are required only if the actor must portray a particularly
difficult character or is attempting an &quot;ad lib&quot; role (<I>i.e.,</I> a nonrehearsed role or on short notice).
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Chanting
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The character is an accomplished chanter and can use this ability to help
fellow workers or soldiers keep pace. Proficiency checks are used to determine the
effectiveness of the chanting.
<P></P>
On a successful proficiency check, those who can hear the chanter become
slightly hypnotized by the rhythmic sound, causing the time spent on arduous,
repetitive tasks to pass quickly. The DM can, at his option, adjust results for
forced marching, rowing, digging, and other such tasks accordingly.
<P></P>
<P></P>

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Those who take this proficiency must specify whether they are skilled at
crafting wind, stringed, percussion, or keyboard instruments. It takes an additional
proficiency slot to gain one of the other skills. Three additional slots allow
the character to take the title &quot;master craftsman&quot; as he is able to craft
instruments of all forms.
<P></P>
A craftsman must buy materials equal to a quarter of the instrument's sale
value. It then takes 1d6 days to craft a wind or percussion instrument, 2d8 days
to form a stringed instrument, and 3d10 days to create a keyboard instrument.
These times assume that the craftsman is spending 10 hours a day working on the
instrument. If craftsman tools (cost 25 gp, weight 5 pounds) are not available,
all times are doubled.
<P></P>
The quality of an instrument is determined by a final proficiency check.
Failure results in an instrument of poor quality, while success indicates good
quality. A natural 20 indicates that the instrument is nonfunctional, while a
natural 1 results in a masterpiece worth twice the normal value.
<P></P>
Simple repairs take only 1d4 hours and require no proficiency check unless the
proper tools are not available. However, repairing severe damage requires 1d8
hours and a check is mandatory for success.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Almost every bard is familiar with the ways of a crowd. However, those who
take crowd working learn all the tricks of the trade. Such bards are skilled at
observing crowds and adjusting their performances accordingly.
<P></P>
Any bard who is using a special ability to adjust the encounter reactions of a
crowd (<I>e.g., </I>influence reactions) can make a crowd working proficiency check. If this check
is successful, the bard can alter the reactions of the crowd by two levels
instead of the typical one.
<P></P>
If the bard or his group is soliciting money from a crowd, a successful
proficiency check indicates that the bard is particularly appealing and the crowd
willingly donates twice as much money as it normally would (or conditions improve
one category if using the performance rules earlier in this handbook).
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Poetry </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
Proficiency in poetry includes the skills of reciting poetry and judging its
quality. It also indicates that the character has a repertoire of poems
memorized for recital at any time. No proficiency check is required for a normal
recital.
<P></P>
If the character can read and write, original poems can be written. A
successful proficiency check indicates that the poem is of above average quality.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Whistling/Humming</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
Almost anyone can whistle or hum. Those who take this proficiency are
exceptional whistlers and hummers. They can produce tunes as captivating as most songs.
A person with this proficiency is a true master whistler and hummer.
<P></P>
It is so easy to learn a new tune to whistle or hum that characters with this
proficiency can learn numerous tunes. In fact, if a proficiency check is made,
a whistler or hummer knows any particular tune in question. In addition, a
character with both this proficiency and the animal lore proficiency can mimic any
bird call he has heard.
<P></P>
However, most adventurers do not take whistling just for the entertainment
value. Instead, they are looking for its uses in communication. This communication
is possible only among those who know this proficiency. If both characters
succeed with their proficiency checks, a single concept can be communicated. Some
examples are &quot;Go around to the side door,&quot; &quot;I hear them coming,&quot; &quot;Slowly reach
out now, the guard doesn't see you.&quot;
