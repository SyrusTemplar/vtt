All specialists use <A HREF="PHB_DD01432.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01432.htm">Table 4</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> on page 16 of the <I>Player's Handbook</I> to determine the number of languages they can learn (in addition to their
native tongue). Certain types of specialists may be able to exceed these limits.
Eligible specialists might include those with exceptionally strong academic
backgrounds or those who devote a large amount of their spare time studying new
tongues.
<P></P>
The types of effects created by a particular wizard might also suggest an
extraordinary aptitude for languages; for example, wizards specializing in
Transformation magic might not seem to have any particular affinity for languages, but
those specializing in Creation might (since they're involved in producing
conditions that didn't previously exist, which could include communication skills).
<P></P>
If a new specialist is to have exceptional language skills, keep the following
guidelines in mind.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> A new specialist should not be able to acquire more than one language over the
limits given in the <I>Player's Handbook</I>. For instance, a specialist with an Intelligence of 9 should not be able to
learn more than three languages.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> The DM should consider limiting extra languages to high-level specialists;
level 15 or higher is suggested, but the DM has the final decision. (In other
words, our specialist with an Intelligence of 9 cannot learn his third language
until he reaches level 15.) <I>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> </I>Learning the extra language should never be automatic. The DM should oblige
the specialist to locate a suitable tutor, devote several hours a day to studying
difficult texts, or invent some other requirement that emphasizes
role-playing. For the transfigurist, nothing about his specialty suggests an exceptional
aptitude for languages, so he'll be restricted to the language limits given in
the <I>Player's Handbook.
