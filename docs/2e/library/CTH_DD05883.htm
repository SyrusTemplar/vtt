Five basic patterns are suggested here. These will be used in later guild
design. They aren't exhaustive, and some clearly shade into others. But these
patterns are perhaps the commonest, and any DM can develop them to suit his
campaign. One factor which isn't considered here, but which will be looked at in guild
design, is how many solo operators, non-guild members, are around. This will
affect the strength of the guild, but won't affect its style of organization so
much.

How a guild is actually led will be dealt with straight after this section,
but for now we'll assume that all guilds are led/ruled by a guildmaster. This
won't always be so, but using this convention saves a lot of tediously repeated
qualifiers.
