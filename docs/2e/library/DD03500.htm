The great majority of alchemists are 0-level characters, as opposed to mages
or specialists in the school of alchemy. They are skilled in the nonweapon
proficiency of alchemy, but cannot cast spells or manufacture potions or magical
items. What common alchemists can do is create nonmagical chemical mixtures that
may be useful to an adventuring party, or provide a character with the
opportunity to purchase spell components from the mineral list at the listed cost. Of
course, the laws of supply and demand apply; the alchemist will charge what he
can get for materials that his customers can’t get anywhere else.

Some of the alchemists’ other wares include the following:

<B>Incendiaries: </B>These dangerous concoctions range from flammable oils and pitches to nasty
stuff like naphtha or Greek fire. Again, refer to the description of the alchemist
nonweapon proficiency in <A HREF="DD03449.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03449.htm">Chapter 4</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> . A flask of an incendiary substance usually costs 10 to 30 gp.

<B>Pyrotechnics: </B>Unlike the previous two substances, pyrotechnic mixtures are often powders.
They can be used to create clouds of smoke of a variety of colors, or bright
flashes of light when added to an existing fire. A vial of pyrotechnic mixture
costs 5 to 20 (5d4) gp, while a flask costs anywhere from 10 to 30 gp.
