The thief will almost certainly be told that certain areas and activities are
definitely off-limits. This is likeliest to apply to major crimes and big
heists when junior thieves are the hopeful plotters (the guild is unlikely to allow
such inexperienced people the chance to bring the wrath of the law down on
everyone's head). But territorial restrictions may be just as important.
<P></P>
The simplest form of this is that certain thieves will have their &quot;own patch&quot;.
Pickpockets are the most clear-cut example. A notably busy thoroughfare, one
where merchants and (especially) foreigners throng, is a patch which a skilled
group of pickpockets will fight determinedly to keep as their own, exclusive
territory. Protection rackets are another obvious case of a demarcated territory
where other guild members do not stick their noses in. These will include
warehouses and offices and homes which are off-limits to burglars, because their
owners pay a sum to the guild to avoid being robbed.
<P></P>
A more complex example of this is where sub-guilds control definite sections
of a city and expect that only their own people are usually allowed any activity
at all within that section. Exceptions are allowed only after careful
consideration by the leader(s) of this group. This situation may happen if a
guildmaster is weak and the second-rankers start carving out territory for themselves,
but it might arise for simple reasons of historical accident (in a walled city
with major internal divisions, gates between town quarters, and so onâ€”the City of
Greyhawk is an example). At its most extreme, a city might in effect (if not
in name) have several thieves' guilds, each controlling one section or quarter
of the city, with the boss of each splinter faction meeting with the others at
regular times to try to co-ordinate efforts and defuse tensions.
