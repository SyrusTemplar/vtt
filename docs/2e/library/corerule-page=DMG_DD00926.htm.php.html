<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cubic Gate:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Another small cubic device, this item is fashioned from carnelian. The six
sides of the cube are each keyed to a plane, one of which will always be the Prime
Material. The other five sides/planes can be determined by the DM in any
manner he chooses.
<P></P>
If a side of the <I>cubic gate</I> is pressed once, it opens a nexus to the appropriate plane. There is a 10%
chance per turn that something will come through it looking for food, fun, or
trouble.
<P></P>
If a side is pressed twice, the creature so doing, along with all creatures in
a 5-foot radius will be drawn through the nexus to the other plane. It is
impossible to open more than one nexus at a time.
