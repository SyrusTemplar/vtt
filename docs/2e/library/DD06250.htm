By means of this spell, the caster causes all vegetation within the affected
area to wither and die, crumbling into black ashes. All vegetation is affected,
from the tallest tree to the tiniest blade of grass. Intelligent plant life,
such as treants, are also destroyed. The power of a <I>wish</I> or its equivalent is required to restore the destroyed vegetation; otherwise,
nothing can grow in the <I>defoliated</I> area for a full year. Note that since <I>defoliate</I> causes plants to crumble to ash, there is no danger of a creature being
struck by a toppling tree; however, creatures hiding in trees will find themselves
plummeting to the ground when this spell is cast.

The material components for this spell are the petal from a withered flower
and a sliver of charred wood.

<I>Fear ward</I> creates an aura around the caster that makes him immune to all forms of fear,
including that caused by dragons. Additionally, <I>fear ward</I> protects the caster from attacks by all forms of undead; the spell is equally
effective against physical and magical attacks. <I>Dispel magic</I> has no effect on <I>fear ward</I>, but a <I>wish </I>will negate it.

The material components for this spell are the fangs of a spider and a hair
from the head of a ghoul.

By means of this spell, the caster temporarily changes himself into a shadow.
The caster gains the movement rate, Armor Class, hit dice, and all abilities of
a shadow. His chilling touch (requiring a normal attack roll) inflicts 2-5
(1d4+1) hit points of damage on his victims as well as draining one point of
Strength. Lost Strength returns in 2-8 (2d4) turns after being touched. If a human
or demihuman victim is reduced to 0 hit points or 0 Strength by the caster in
shadow form, the victim has lost all of his life force and is immediately drawn
into the Negative Material Plane where he will forever after exist as a shadow.
<P></P>
All of the caster's weapons and equipment stay with him, but he is unable to
use them while in <I>shadow form</I>. He is also unable to cast spells while in<I> shadow form</I>, but he is immune to <I>sleep, charm,</I> and <I>hold </I>spells, and is unaffected by cold-based attacks. He is 90 percent undetectable
in all but the brightest of surroundings. Unlike normal shadows, a wizard in
shadow form cannot be turned by priests. At the end of the spell's duration,
there is a 5% chance that the caster will permanently remain as a shadow. Nothing
short of a <I>wish</I> can return the caster to his normal form.
<P></P>
The material components for this spell are the shroud from a corpse at least
100 years old and a black glass marble.
