This is simply any kind of heavy paper or (more usually) cloth which has been
soaked in tar, honey, treacle, or anything suitably sticky. The thief usually
uses it by slapping it on a window before breaking the glass in a window-pane.
The sticky surface keeps all the fragments together as the glass breaks. Noise
is considerably reduced, both from cushioning the impact of a hammer on glass
and by preventing broken glass from scattering all over the floor beyond the
window. If there is someone within fairly close listening distance, the DM may make
a secret move silently roll for the thief when using this stratagem.
<P></P>
Tar paper can also be used with a glass cutter (see above), being affixed to
the center of the area of glass to be cut out, so that it can be simply pulled
out when the cutter has done its work.
