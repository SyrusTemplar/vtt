<P></P>
<A NAME="0015375a"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Adze.</B> Resembling an axe with a sideways blade, the adze is a common tool. Some
savage tribes use a short-handled war adze as a close-combat weapon. Common adzes
can be found in most woodworkers’ shops.
<P></P>
<A NAME="039c0458"></A><B>Ankus. </B>The ankus is an elephant goad. It is a three- to four-foot staff with a metal
hook and point at one end. The ankus was intended to be both a tool and a
weapon, and some were used as elaborate ceremonial pieces.
<P></P>
<A NAME="332856ea"></A><B>Axe, stone. </B>This crude weapon consists of an edged piece of stone lashed to a wooden haft.
Normally, it’s only found in the most primitive of settings.
<P></P>
<A NAME="41a1913d"></A><B>Bagh nakh. </B>Also known as “tiger claws,” a bagh nakh is a set of metal blades worn on the
palm. It is used with a cat-like clawing motion. Usually, the bagh nakh is used
in pairs, one on each hand. It is available only in Indian or Oriental
settings.
<P></P>
<A NAME="ee95876d"></A><B>Battle axe. </B>Hundreds of variations on the battle axe exist. Generally, any heavy axe that
can be used one-handed or two-handed falls into this category. (If an axe can
only be used two-handed, it’s a two-handed axe.) Battle axes often have a spike,
hammer, or smaller blade backing the primary blade. In some cases, both blades
are equal in size in weight and can be used interchangeably.
<P></P>
Other names for a battle axe include the <I>bullova, bearded axe, bipennis, </I>and <I>war axe.</I>
<P></P>
<A NAME="07c591dd"></A><B>Belaying pin. </B>This is a weapon of convenience for sailors of any campaign. Belaying pins are
used to secure the lines of a ship’s rigging, and there’s always one nearby on
the deck of a ship.
<P></P>
<A NAME="79f0281e"></A><B>Blowgun. </B>Blowguns can fire two types of ammunition: a barbed dart, suitable for hunting
small fowl, and a needle for carrying poison. Most blowguns are six or seven
feet in length, although assassins might carry a miniature weapon two feet long
that can only fire needles.
<P></P>
Blowgun ammunition is very light and cannot penetrate heavy armor. If a target
is protected by a full suit of brigandine, mail, or plate of any kind, the
attacker suffers an additional –4 to his attack roll.
<P></P>
<A NAME="47357568"></A><B>Bo stick. </B>This oriental staff is a tapering length of wood about four to six feet in
length. The wielder of a bo stick suffers a –2 penalty to attacks against an
opponent in plate armor of any kind.
<P></P>
<A NAME="03d16979"></A><B>Bolas. </B>Bolas consist of two or three weights joined by a sturdy leather cord or rope.
They have been used by hunters since the Stone Age. A character must be
proficient with the bolas to throw them successfully. If the bolas hit their target,
they automatically create a knockdown chance for their victim. If the victim
fails his saving throw, he has to spend a full round and make a Strength check to
be able to stand and move again.
<P></P>
Bolas can also be used for special called shots. A called shot at the target’s
arms will prevent the target from using his weapon or shield until he spends a
round and succeeds in a Strength check. A called shot at the target’s head
wraps the bolas around his neck and begins to strangle him. He suffers 1d3 points
of damage from strangulation each round until the bolas are removed or he dies.
<P></P>
A sharp knife, dagger, or similar short blade can be used to sever a bola’s
cords. This replaces the Strength check to get free, and is automatically
successful. Of course, the victim must have an arm free to cut the bolas loose.
<P></P>
<A NAME="3c7a466a"></A><B>Boomerang. </B>Another ancient hunting weapon, the boomerang is a heavy, aerodynamic club. It
does not normally return to its thrower; a proficient user has to make a
called shot to set up a throw that will return in the event of a miss.
<P></P>
<A NAME="a436f40e"></A><B>Bottle. </B>Bottles are found in taverns and alehouses all over the world. Each time a
bottle hits, it must roll a successful saving throw vs. normal blow or break. A
broken bottle can be wielded as if it were a knife.
<P></P>
<A NAME="0000875e"></A><B>Bow. </B>One of the most common weapons throughout history is the bow. The simple self
bow, or short bow, has been used for hunting and war since before the dawn of
civilization. If a bow is made from a single piece of wood, it is a plain long
or short bow; if it is made from laminated horn, wood, bone, or any other
materials, it is a composite bow.
<P></P>
If a character has an unusually low Strength score, he <I>must </I>apply any attack or damage penalties to his archery. He is forced to use bows
that have a lighter pull. However, for a character to gain his bonuses for a
high Strength score, he must get a custom-made bow, which costs 3–5 times the
normal price. A higher-Strength character can always use a lower-Strength bow,
gaining bonuses up to the maximum permitted by the bow. For example, a character
with a Strength of 18/35 can use a bow made for a Strength of 17, gaining a +1
to hit and +1 to damage instead of his normal full bonuses.
<P></P>
Short bows can be found in any setting. Even if they are not used for war,
they are the weapon of choice for many hunters. Short bows fire flight arrows or
stone arrows.
<P></P>
Long bows are simply bigger short bows. They are drawn to the cheek, instead
of being drawn to the chest as other bows are. Long bows can fire any kind of
arrow. Long bows cannot be used from horseback.
<P></P>
Composite short bows are the favorite of horse archers everywhere. They can
fire flight arrows or stone arrows.
<P></P>
Composite long bows are usually only found in eastern campaigns. They can be
fired from horseback if they have been specially built for it, at twice the
normal cost. Composite long bows fire any kind of arrow.
<P></P>
Flight arrows are the basic war or hunting arrow. They fly farther than sheaf
arrows, which have a broader and heavier head for more damage. Pile arrows are
constructed with small, dense points designed to pierce heavy armor. A pile
arrow fired at short range penalizes the target’s AC from armor by 2 points. This
only applies to that portion of a target’s armor that is derived from physical
armor; Dexterity, cover, or magical bonuses are not affected.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>For example, an archer fires a pile arrow at a warrior wearing chainmail +2
and a shield with a Dexterity of 16. The chainmail is considered to be 2 points
worse, so it has a base AC of 7, not 5. Overall, the warrior’s AC drops from 0
to 2. If the warrior wore nothing but bracers of defense (AC 4), his AC would
not be affected.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="04cd05cc"></A></I><B>Brandistock. </B>The brandistock is an iron-shod walking staff that conceals three blades. When
deployed, the blades form a small trident. In situations where the enemy isn’t
expecting a character to be so armed, the DM can assign a +1 surprise or
initiative bonus.
<P></P>
<A NAME="91b5ca25"></A><B>Caltrop. </B>A caltrop is a cluster of four or more iron spikes, designed so that one point
is always facing up (they would look similar to a d4—one point is always up).
They are intended to be scattered in the path of an enemy, who may step on one
if he’s not careful.
<P></P>
In order to be effective, at least 10 caltrops must be scattered in a 5'x5'
square (or 100 in a 15'x15' area, one square in missile scale.) Any character
entering the area must roll a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation or step on
a caltrop, suffering the listed damage. The victim is reduced to 1/2 movement
until he spends a round removing the caltrop from his foot. In addition, the
character must make a second saving throw; if he fails, his foot is considered to
be struck (see <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02715.htm.php.html#8558030f"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02715.htm.php.html#8558030f">Chapter Six</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">) and he is reduced to 1/3 movement until it heals.
<P></P>
A character moving at half his normal speed or slower can pick his way through
the caltrops without trouble—as long as he can see them. A low ground fog or
long grass may hide caltrops from even the most observant characters. If a
character is running or charging when he steps on a caltrop, he must stop
immediately.
<P></P>
<A NAME="aaef3fdd"></A><B>Cestus. </B>The cestus is an armored gauntlet equipped with spikes, blades, and other such
things. It is worn over the fist and used for punching an opponent. The cestus
suffers a –2 penalty to attacks against enemies in any kind of plate armor.
<P></P>
<A NAME="03fcc805"></A><B>Chain. </B>The chain is simply a weighted length of chain that is whirled rapidly. It is
used to strike and tangle an opponent. If the chain is used for a pull/trip
maneuver, the attacker gains a +4 bonus on his Strength check. This also applies
to pull/trips against riders.
<P></P>
<A NAME="ccc3391f"></A><B>Chakram. </B>The chakram is a throwing quoit or disk with a sharpened outer edge, about a
foot in diameter. It is thrown frisbee-style, with a rapid spin. The chakram is
not as effective against armored opponents and suffers a –2 penalty to attacks
against targets in any kind of mail, scale, or plate armor.
<P></P>
<A NAME="a9bdb2e4"></A><B>Chijikiri. </B>This composite weapon consists of a spear with a length of chain attached to
the butt. It can be wielded as an ordinary spear, or reversed and used to tangle
or flail at an enemy. If the chain end is used, the chijikiri is a Type B
weapon that inflicts damage as a chain. The chijikiri adds +4 to the attacker’s
effective Strength for pull/trip maneuvers but cannot be used to pull/trip a rider.
<P></P>
<A NAME="0017dd6e"></A><B>Club. </B>Mankind’s oldest weapon exists in thousands of varieties. Clubs range from
something as simple as an animal’s thigh bone to a well-balanced work of art. Not
all clubs can be thrown, but throwing weapons are common enough that a PC can
obtain one as easily as a melee-only weapon. Clubs are effectively free, but if
a PC wants to get one that is recognized as a warrior’s weapon it may cost
anywhere from 5 sp to 10 gp.
<P></P>
<A NAME="429a8ab6"></A><B>Club, great. </B>The great club is simply a two-handed version of the regular club. It is often
equipped with nails, spikes, or bands of iron. Its greater size and mass gives
it a better damage potential than its smaller forebear.
<P></P>
<A NAME="98ed045a"></A><B>Crossbow. </B>A crossbow is a short, powerful bow mounted on a rifle-like stock. It is aimed
and fired like a rifle. Historically, crossbows were more powerful than bows
and had better hitting power at a greater range, but they were also far slower.
The English longbow was never decisively bested by the crossbow simply because
a trained archer could fire six arrows to the crossbowman’s single bolt.
<P></P>
Crossbows were invented sometime in the Dark Ages, but didn’t come into
widespread use until the Crusades. The earliest crossbows were pellet bows that fired
small stones or bullets instead of quarrels. The weapon rapidly grew larger
and more powerful. By the Renaissance, many crossbows couldn’t be drawn by hand
and had to be winched back by a hand-held cranequin.
<P></P>
For game purposes, crossbows are divided into five categories: the pellet bow
(the lightest crossbow commonly available), the light crossbow, the heavy
crossbow, the cho-ku-no or repeating crossbow, and the hand crossbow. The light
crossbow can be cocked by hand, but the heavy crossbow requires the use of an
attached cranequin to draw it. The cho-ku-no is similar to a light crossbow, but
holds up to 10 bolts in a magazine that rests on top of the weapon. Normally, it
is only available in oriental settings. The hand crossbow is derived from the
Drow weapon, but could have been built in Renaissance-like settings as a weapon
for personal defense or assassination.
<P></P>
To reflect the power of a crossbow, the damage ratings have been increased.
Under the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01630.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01630.htm.php.html">PHB</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> rules, characters have little reason to ever use a crossbow when a short bow
is handy. In addition, crossbows gain a special <I>armor penetration </I>ability. At medium range, light and heavy crossbows reduce the AC of an
armored opponent by 2 points. (See the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02743.htm.php.html#0000875e"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02743.htm.php.html#0000875e">pile arrow</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> description under bow.) At short range, light and heavy crossbows reduce the
AC of an armored opponent by 5 points. Pellet bows, hand crossbows, and
cho-ku-no do not have this special ability.
<P></P>
Heavy crossbows are also called <I>arbalests.</I>
<P></P>
<A NAME="b2d2d15a"></A><B>Dagger. </B>Mankind’s second oldest weapon is probably the stone dagger. Daggers are
short, stabbing blades ranging from six inches to more than a foot in length. Their
size and utility have made them a very long-lived weapon used in many times and
places.
<P></P>
In Stone Age or savage settings, metal daggers may not be available. Daggers
can also be made of sharpened stone or bone. However, weapons of these inferior
materials have a 1 in 6 chance of breaking on any successful hit.
<P></P>
Renaissance settings introduce several variations on the common dagger,
including the <I>main-gauche, parrying dagger, </I>and <I>stiletto</I>. The main-gauche and parrying dagger are designed to be used in the off hand
of a swordsman armed with a rapier or sabre. Their heavy guards and quillons
give the user a special +2 bonus to any attempts to block with the weapon. In
addition, the parrying dagger may break an enemy’s sword when used in a defensive
disarm maneuver. If the maneuver succeeds, the attacker must roll a successful
saving throw vs. crushing blow for his sword if it is a rapier, or vs. normal
blow for any other kind of sword.
<P></P>
The stiletto is a long, thin blade designed solely for piercing. It can punch
through armor or slip between the links of chainmail. This gives the stiletto a
special +2 bonus to attacks against armored opponents. (See the note under <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02743.htm.php.html#0000875e"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02743.htm.php.html#0000875e">pile arrow</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I> </I>or <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02743.htm.php.html#98ed045a"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02743.htm.php.html#98ed045a">crossbow</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>.)</I>
<P></P>
The jambiya and katar are weapons found in eastern campaigns. The jambiya is
the traditional Arab dagger, with a sharply curved blade. It is often ornately
decorated. The katar is a dagger with an ‘H’ handle, designed to be held in a
closed fist with the blade projecting out over the knuckles. It is used with a
punching motion.
<P></P>
<A NAME="0018c41f"></A><B>Dart. </B>These weapons are not the tiny modern darts you may be familiar with. They’re
much larger and heavier than their sporting counterparts. Darts were usually as
large as a typical arrow, with a weighted head. They were popular among
ancient peoples and eastern cultures, and were used as small javelins by skirmishers
and light cavalry.
<P></P>
<A NAME="573c7956"></A><B>Firearms. </B>Guns are completely optional in the AD&amp;D game. If the DM rules that they are
not available in his campaign, no character may take proficiency in a firearm or
purchase one. Like many weapons, firearms gradually improved over time,
increasing in reliability, range, and firepower.
<P></P>
Firearms have several unusual characteristics. First of all, they are subject
to misfires. Modern tests have shown that primitive firearms probably misfired
as often as once every four shots. When a character’s attack roll falls in the
misfire range, the DM should roll 2d6 and consult the following table:
<P></P>
<P></P>

<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Hangfire
<BR></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
An <I>explosion </I>inflicts 2d6 points of damage on the character holding the gun, or 1d6 if a
saving throw vs. death is successful. The gun is destroyed by the misfire. A <I>fouled barrel </I>ruins the shot and renders the gun useless until it is carefully cleaned—a
process that will take a good 10–30 (1d3x10) minutes. A <I>hangfire </I>goes off 1d3 combat rounds later than it should. If the user keeps the gun
trained on its target, he can make a normal attack.
<P></P>
The second unusual characteristic of firearms is their ability to ignore
armor. Any firearm except a hand match weapon may ignore the portion of a target’s
AC that is derived from physical armor or shield. At short range, Dexterity,
cover, and magical bonuses are the only factors that contribute to a target’s AC.
At medium range, the target’s base AC is penalized by 5 (which may be as bad as
ignoring it altogether), and at long range, the base AC is penalized by 2.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>For example, a renegade knight in </I>plate mail +3 <I>is fired upon by the king’s musketeers. Normally, his AC is a base 0. A
short-range musket shot ignores the 7-point AC reduction provided by plate mail, and
only the armor’s +3 enchantment is considered. The renegade knight’s AC is a 7.
At medium range, the armor is not completely ignored, but the base AC of 3 is
reduced to an AC of 8. Magic adjusts this to AC 5. At long range, the knight is
AC 2 against musket fire.
<P></P>
</I>
<P></P>
Last but not least is the ability of a firearm to cause open-ended damage. Any
time a firearm hits its target, there is a 25% chance that a second damage die
is rolled and added to the first. There’s a 25% chance that <I>that </I>damage roll creates additional damage, and so on. This 25% chance is part of
the knockdown die roll; if the knockdown die comes up 7 or better, the damage
continues.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>For example, Sir Vandegar is shot by an uncouth man-at-arms wielding a horse
pistol. The damage roll comes up a 3, but the knockdown die is an 8. A second
damage die is rolled, which results in 5 more points of damage. Vandegar’s
attacker rolls another knockdown die, which comes up 7, so he rolls a third damage
die, getting a 6. Fortunately, he misses on his chance to do any more damage, but
Sir Vandegar suffers a total of 14 points from a single bullet.
<P></P>
</I>
<P></P>
The very earliest firearms were <I>hand match </I>devices that resembled a hand-held bombard. Hand match weapons include the
handgunne and the arquebus. Unlike other guns, hand match weapons have no triggers
or firing mechanisms. Instead, the user touches a burning slow match to a hole
in the barrel, igniting the weapon’s charge. The handgunne doesn’t even fire a
bullet, but propels a heavy iron arrow that cannot cause continuing damage
like other firearms. All hand match weapons suffer <I>double </I>the normal range penalties for medium and long-range shots.
<P></P>
The <I>matchlock </I>was a significant improvement. It freed one of the user’s hands by providing a
clamp to hold the slow match, and provided a trigger mechanism that would
bring the match into contact with the priming powder. The matchlock arquebus is a
far more powerful and reliable weapon than the hand match version. Matchlocks
were also made as calivers and muskets. The caliver was a smaller weapon that
fired a lighter bullet. The matchlock musket was a long, heavy weapon that had to
be fired from a forked rest or balanced on a wall.
<P></P>
Wheellocks were the next improvement to the firearm. Instead of a burning
match, the powder was ignited by sparks provided by a spring-driven wheel of flint.
It worked a lot like a modern cigarette lighter. Wheellocks were
contemporaries of snaplocks, which held a single piece of flint in a hammer-like striker.
The snaplock was easier to manufacture, but less reliable, so wheellocks were
often the weapon of the nobility and anyone else who could afford to spend more
money on a gun. The wheellock arquebus was a light but powerful weapon reserved
for use by the wealthy or the privileged. Interestingly enough, wheellocks were
never developed outside of Europe.
<P></P>
Pistols were also introduced as wheellocks but were also manufactured as
snaplocks. At first, pistols were the weapon of the cavalry. The horse pistol
replaced the lance as the weapon of choice for horsemen. Most cavalrymen carried two
or three of these heavy pistols for dealing with pikemen and other such
annoyances. In time, belt pistols were produced as lighter versions of the horse
pistol for personal defense.
<P></P>
Flintlocks were the direct descendants of snaplocks. They are almost
indistinguishable from each other, but the later flintlocks tended to be sturdier and
more reliable than their predecessors. Flintlocks saw the introduction of the
carbine, or horseman’s musket, which was a lighter weapon than the infantryman’s
gun. By the time flintlocks had been invented, muskets no longer required a rest
for their barrels and could be fired from the shoulder.
<P></P>
The blunderbuss was the ancestor of the modern shotgun. It was a short,
musket-like weapon with a bell-shaped, flaring muzzle. Just about anything could be
poured into the barrel of a blunderbuss and then fired at an enemy—stones,
nails, coins, or even salt or gravel. At short range, a blunderbuss actually
inflicts 1d4 separate attacks on its target, but none of the projectiles are heavy
enough to inflict the extra damage of other firearms. At medium range, the
blunderbuss makes a single attack on 1d3 separate targets in a 3-foot radius (or one
square.) At long range, the blunderbuss inflicts 0–1 (1d2–1) attacks on any
targets in a 5-foot radius (four squares.) A lucky blunderbuss shot can knock down
four or five attackers at once, or it may only make a big noise and miss
everything.
<P></P>
Combined weapons are an interesting side-note in the history of firearms. When
firearms were still relatively new, it was fairly common to make sure that the
weapon retained its usefulness after its first shot by building a melee weapon
around it. Hammers, axes, broadswords, and daggers were all made with parallel
gun barrels. In some cases, the barrel actually served as the weapon’s haft.
The numbers listed on the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02742.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02742.htm.php.html">table</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> reflect the weapon’s stats as a melee weapon; otherwise, it is treated as a
wheellock belt pistol.
<P></P>
<A NAME="049e2262"></A><B>Flail. </B>Developed from the farmer’s threshing tool, flails were used on battlefields
throughout the Middle Ages. The common grain flail can be found on the Tools
list, since nearly every farm has several around. The horseman’s flail is similar,
but uses iron weights and replaces the linking rope with sturdy chain. The
horseman’s flail gains a +1 bonus on attacks against targets using shields, since
it can easily strike around them. In addition, horseman’s flails gain a +2
bonus on any attempts to trap or offensively disarm an opponent’s weapon.
<P></P>
The footman’s flail is a different weapon entirely. It consists of a sturdy
shaft with a hinged (not chain-joined!) iron-spiked head. It is used with two
hands and can deliver crushing blows of great power. The footman’s flail gains a
special +1 attack bonus against opponents in any kind of plate armor.
<P></P>
<A NAME="001b965a"></A><B>Fork. </B>The common pitchfork has been adopted as a ready means of defense by farmers
throughout the ages. Almost any farm or town has a plentiful supply of forks.
<P></P>
<A NAME="926cc79e"></A><B>Gaff/hook. </B>The gaff is a short, T-handled hook used to boat fish or handle heavy crates.
For 5 gp, a hook can be attached in place of a missing hand, which provides a
character with a weapon that cannot be disarmed.
<P></P>
<A NAME="078a544f"></A><B>Grapple. </B>Grapples are often used at sea and in sieges. Usually, they are made from
three or four iron hooks welded together and a sturdy length of rope. Grapples can
be thrown 5 feet horizontally or 3 feet vertically per point of Strength.
Although grapples aren’t intended for personal combat, a creative character can
improvise a number of pull/trip maneuvers with a grapple and length of rope.
<P></P>
<A NAME="d1387f0c"></A><B>Gunsen. </B>This deceptive weapon resembles an oriental fan. It is both a parrying device
and an effective bludgeon. The paper fan contained in a gunsen is used to
distract and confuse an opponent, and is often decorated with beautiful designs. A
character proficient in the gunsen’s use gains a special +2 bonus to any block
maneuvers she makes with the fan.
<P></P>
<A NAME="d5e6f30e"></A><B>Hammer. </B>Used in almost any craftsman’s trade, hammers can be found in shops and
worksheds everywhere. Most working hammers are much smaller and lighter than any
military versions.
<P></P>
<A NAME="b19fef4d"></A><B>Hand or throwing axe. </B>Variations on the medium-sized axe exist in almost any setting. Not every hand
axe can be thrown; the weapon must be built for balance to be thrown, although
this isn’t particularly rare or unusual. The Franks made excellent use of
throwing axes as a shock weapon; the Frankish line would halt just short of the
enemy and hurl a murderous volley of axes before closing for hand-to-hand
fighting. With a called shot, an axe can be thrown at an enemy’s shield, which must
then roll a successful saving throw vs. normal blow or be ruined.
<P></P>
<A NAME="eed3945f"></A><B>Harpoon. </B>Rarely used on the battlefield, the harpoon is the weapon of sealers and
whalers throughout the world. The head of a harpoon is hinged to lodge in a wound
and fix the harpoon to its target. A roll of 5 or better on the knockdown die
indicates that the harpoon is stuck in the victim, and will cause an additional
1d6 damage if it is yanked out or cut out of the wound.
<P></P>
Usually, a strong line is attached to the harpoon so that the hunter can keep
hold of his prey after striking with the weapon. If the head is stuck, the
wielder can engage in an opposed Strength contest with the target to pull him off
his feet. When harpoons are used against large creatures, the cord is usually
tied off to the hunter’s boat, which helps the hunter’s Strength check
considerably.
<P></P>
<A NAME="ef2bf013"></A><B>Hatchet. </B>Many smaller hand axes actually fall into this category. The hatchet’s small
size permits it to be used as an off-hand weapon. Hatchets are also handy tools
for wilderness travelers or people who work with wood.
<P></P>
<A NAME="73664f5d"></A><B>Holy symbol. </B>Only the most impressive personal holy symbols are large enough to be wielded
as bludgeons. If a creature is subject to damage from coming into contact with
a holy symbol, this is in addition to the bludgeoning damage inflicted by the
weight of the blow. Of course, if a creature is only hit by magical weapons,
then the holy symbol must be enchanted to inflict bludgeoning damage.
<P></P>
<A NAME="e12780f7"></A><B>Javelin. </B>Light throwing spears have been used in warfare and hunting for thousands of
years. By the time of the Crusades, javelins are generally found in the hands of
nonWestern cultures; they lack the penetrating power to be effective against
heavy Western armor.
<P></P>
<A NAME="056bb47a"></A><B>Jitte. </B>The jitte is an iron parrying bar with a short hook at one end. It isn’t
sharp, but can be used to strike bludgeoning blows. The jitte provides a special +2
bonus to block or defensive disarm maneuvers.
<P></P>
<A NAME="0021413a"></A><B>Kama. </B>This weapon is a straight-bladed sickle derived from the common peasant’s
tool. Since it is regarded as a tool, it can be carried by a character who wishes
to conceal the fact that he is armed.
<P></P>
<A NAME="436109d5"></A><B>Kau sin ke. </B>The kau sin ke, or whipping chain, is an oriental version of the flail. It
consists of four to six iron bars linked end-to-end by short lengths of chain. The
kau sin ke gains a special +1 bonus to attack rolls against opponents using
shields, since it can strike around the shield.
<P></P>
<A NAME="233e3659"></A><B>Kawanaga. </B>This weapon consists of a grapple with a weighted rope attached. The hook or
weight can be used to strike at opponents, and the grapple is handy for climbing
as well. The kawanaga adds +4 to the attacker’s effective Strength when used
to perform the pull/trip maneuver.
<P></P>
<A NAME="05a59e3d"></A><B>Knife. </B>Perhaps the most common weapon is the humble knife. Almost everyone carries
small knives for eating, as an all-purpose tool, or for personal defense. Knives
are shorter than daggers and are used to both slash and stab. They can be
easily concealed in a variety of specialty sheaths, ranging from a dandy’s hat-band
to spring-loaded wrist sheaths. Bone and stone knives can be manufactured in
settings where iron and steel are unavailable.
<P></P>
<A NAME="77adeb30"></A><B>Kusari-gama. </B>The kusari-gama consists of a kama, or sickle, with an attached length of
chain. It is extremely versatile and can be employed in a number of ways. Like
several other chain weapons, it adds a +4 bonus to the attacker’s Strength checks
when used to perform the pull/trip attack option.
<P></P>
<A NAME="05ca2713"></A><B>Lance. </B>The lance is the horseman’s spear. It has been used in warfare since the
Bronze Age. Prior to the invention of the stirrup, the lance could not be couched
for a charge; instead, the horseman would stab overhand with the weapon or even
throw it. As a rule of thumb, a rider must be mounted on a horse appropriate for
his lance, or else his weapon will be reduced in effectiveness. A heavy lance
requires a heavy warhorse, a medium lance requires a medium warhorse, and so
on. If the lance is too heavy for the horse, it does damage as if it were the
correct type, so a heavy lance used from a light warhorse does damage as a light
lance.
<P></P>
Generally, the heavy warhorse was a European development that appeared in the
later stages of the Crusades. Before the development of heavy plate armor, it
wasn’t necessary to use draft horses for mounts.
<P></P>
Lances are an exception to the size requirement rules; a rider with stirrups
can use any lance in one hand, but a rider without stirrups has to use two hands
for the lance. (Stirrups appeared during the Dark Ages in Western Europe.) As
noted above, a rider with stirrups can couch the lance for a mounted charge,
which causes double damage.
<P></P>
In addition to the light, medium, and heavy lances, Late Middle Ages campaigns
will also see the use of the jousting lance. This weapon is blunted to prevent
its target from being severely injured during a tournament.
<P></P>
<A NAME="d128ddd2"></A><B>Lantern. </B>On occasion, a character has to make do with whatever’s handy. A lantern can
be used as a crude club, inflicting light damage, but if it is lit it may spill
burning oil over the defender. Roll an item saving throw for glass against a
normal blow; if the lantern breaks, the victim is burned for an additional 1d4
points of damage and may be on fire. See <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02743.htm.php.html#0000e436"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02743.htm.php.html#0000e436">oil</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
<A NAME="05ca4dea"></A><B>Lasso. </B>The lasso, or lariat, is commonly associated with nomadic cultures. Native
Americans and Central Asians commonly used the lasso on animals, and it was only
rarely used against an enemy. Lassoes are only effective when used in
conjunction with a called shot attack; they cannot be used for normal attacks.
<P></P>
If the attacker succeeds with a called shot against his opponent’s legs, he
gets the lasso to settle low enough on his opponent’s body that he can pull/trip
his enemy. He gains a special +4 bonus to his opposed Strength check. If the
attacker is mounted and has the lasso made fast to his saddle, he is considered
to be the size of his mount—so a rider on horseback is size L for purposes of
the opposed Strength check, for a total of +8 versus Man-sized targets.
<P></P>
If the attacker succeeds with a called shot against his opponent’s arms, he
can trap his enemy’s weapon, shield, or both by pinning his arms to his body. The
lasso user’s opposed attack roll is made against AC 10 instead of AC 2. If the
attacker wins the roll, one arm (randomly determined) of the defender is
trapped. If he beats him by 4 or more, both arms are trapped. In addition, if the
attacker is mounted and the lasso is tied off to the saddle, he can perform a
pull/trip next round without an attack roll simply by spurring his horse.
<P></P>
Last but not least, a lasso can unhorse a rider by succeeding in a called
shot. If the rider is moving and the lasso is tied off to something solid (like a
tree), he is automatically unhorsed. If the rider isn’t moving or the lasso
isn’t tied off, an opposed Strength check is used to determine whether or not the
rider is unhorsed.
<P></P>
<A NAME="d56890f6"></A><B>Mace, horseman’s. </B>The mace is another ancient weapon that remained in use until the 19th century
in many parts of the world. The horseman’s mace is lighter and shorter than
the footman’s for ease of use from horseback. Most horseman’s maces are
constructed from four to eight iron flanges. The horseman’s mace receives a +1 bonus to
attacks against opponents in any kind of mail armor.
<P></P>
Some horseman’s maces of Middle Eastern or Oriental origin feature sword-like
basket hilts. The hilt provides a +1 bonus to attempts to block attacks with
the weapon.
<P></P>
<A NAME="f2cedd7b"></A><B>Mace, footman’s. </B>The footman’s mace is a hafted weapon with a heavy iron or bronze head. The
head can be spherical or flanged, and may feature spikes or knobs. Like its
smaller cousin, the footman’s mace is especially useful against flexible armors and
receives a +2 bonus to attacks against enemies in mail of any kind.
<P></P>
<A NAME="08088ce3"></A><B>Mace-axe. </B>This Bronze Age weapon features a mace-like head with a single curving axe
blade projecting from it. It is heavy and awkward, but delivers a formidable blow.
<P></P>
<A NAME="47a4d209"></A><B>Machete. </B>The machete is regarded as a tool by some cultures, and as a weapon of war by
others. It consists of a short, heavy, slightly curved blade designed for
slashing. Many varieties of tribal swords or fighting knives fall into the category
of machetes, and may be elaborately decorated blades of superior construction
and balance. In eastern lands, these blades are known as parangs.
<P></P>
<A NAME="652eb60e"></A><B>Mancatcher. </B>The mancatcher is a short pole-arm with two curving, fork-like prongs at the
business end. The prongs are hinged so that they can be pushed tightly closed
around the intended captive. The mancatcher only works against Size M creatures.
Like crossbows and firearms, mancatchers ignore armor—only Dexterity and
magical adjustments apply. If a hit is scored, the victim suffers the listed damage.
Each round, the mancatcher’s user can push and pull the victim about for an
automatic 1d2 points of damage, and can try to pull/trip his victim by succeeding
in an opposed Strength check.
<P></P>
Once caught, the victim loses all Dexterity and shield adjustments to AC. He
can only escape by hacking through the weapon’s haft (AC 4, 10 hp, size M type S
weapon to damage) or making a bend bars/lift gates roll, which causes an
additional 1d2 damage.
<P></P>
Mancatchers are used by town watches and gendarmes to capture armed criminals.
<P></P>
<A NAME="0023afc3"></A><B>Maul. </B>The maul is a military sledgehammer designed for two-handed use. It is about
three to four feet in length with a heavy square head. It receives a +1 bonus to
attacks against opponents in plate or mail armors. Traditionally, the maul was
carried by lightly armored troops such as archers for use against dismounted
knights.
<P></P>
<A NAME="ad172192"></A><B>Morningstar. </B>Also known as the godentag or holy water sprinkler, the morningstar is a
hafted weapon three to five feet in length with a heavy, spiked head. It is designed
for two-handed use and often features a polearm-like spike at its end. Like
the maul, the morningstar was built to penetrate a knight’s armor. It receives a
+1 bonus to attack rolls against any type of plate armor.
<P></P>
<A NAME="0000dc59"></A><B>Net. </B>Rarely used as a weapon, the net is only found in unusual settings. A fighting
net often features small barbs or weights in the weave and a trailing rope for
guidance and contol over netted targets. The net’s only function in
hand-to-hand combat is to block, trap, or disarm an opponent; it cannot strike
effectively for damage.
<P></P>
The net is most dangerous when it is thrown at an enemy. Only the target’s
Dexterity and magical adjustments to Armor Class count. If the net hits, it may
trap the opponent’s weapon and shield. If the victim is trapped, he can only
break free by making a Strength check. In future rounds the net user has the choice
of leaving the net where it is and attacking with another weapon or of trying
to improve the capture.
<P></P>
To improve the net’s capture, the netter loops the trailing rope around the
target. This requires another attack roll (as before, only count Dexterity and
magic.) If the netter hits, the victim’s effective Strength drops by 4 for
purposes of getting out of the net.
<P></P>
Nets must be folded properly to be effectively thrown. The first time a
character throws his net in a fight, he makes a normal attack roll. After the net is
unfolded, it can only by thrown with a –4 penalty to hit. It takes 2 combat
rounds for a proficient user to fold a net.
<P></P>
<A NAME="215e3093"></A><B>Nunchaku. </B>The nunchuks consist of two wooden or iron bars linked by a small length of
chain. Like the western flail, they are descendants of the common grain flail. A
proficient user may wield nunchaku in each hand, despite the fact that they are
identical in size—but the attack penalties for attacking with two weapons
still apply.
<P></P>
<A NAME="0000e436"></A><B>Oil. </B>Burning oil can be an effective weapon in some situations. There are three
basic uses for oil: igniting a puddle under an enemy’s feet, throwing or splashing
burning oil on him, or making a Molotov cocktail.
<P></P>
If an enemy can be lured into a place where oil in contact with him can be
ignited, he suffers 1d4 points of damage per two flasks that have been prepared
for firing. The victim must attempt a saving throw roll vs. paralyzation or <I>catch fire</I>—see below. There is no attack roll for this type of attack, but if the oil
has to be ignited by a burning arrow or thrown torch, the DM can insist that an
attack roll versus AC 10 be made to get the fire to the oil.
<P></P>
Throwing burning oil at a target is difficult. This category is reserved for
things like busting a burning lantern over someone’s head or dumping a bowl on
the intended victim. The victim suffers 1d3 points of damage per flask thrown
and must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation with a +4 bonus or catch fire. An
attack roll is required for this type of attack, but only the defender’s
Dexterity and magical adjustments are considered for AC.
<P></P>
A Molotov cocktail requires a full combat round to fuse and light, so one can
be thrown only once per two rounds. As above, an attack roll is required; only
count the defender’s Dexterity and magical adjustments. If struck, the defender
gets to roll a saving throw vs. death to see if the cocktail went off or not;
if it does, the victim suffers 1d8 points of damage and must roll a successful
saving throw vs. paralyzation or catch fire.
<P></P>
Victims who catch fire suffer 1d4 points of damage in the round following
their unfortunate change of status. They are allowed to roll a saving throw vs.
death to extinguish the flames each round; if they fail, the base damage is
increased by 1 die. Therefore, a character who is on fire suffers 1d4 points of
damage the first round, 2d4 the second, 3d4 the third, and so on, to a maximum of
5d4 per round. Leaping into a lake, extinguishing the flames magically, or
rolling around on the ground may allow the character to roll his saving throw with a
+2 to +8 bonus, at the DM’s discretion.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<A NAME="00278a3d"></A><B>Pick. </B>This common tool can be used as a weapon but is very heavy and unwieldy.
<P></P>
<A NAME="a46f775b"></A><B>Pick, horseman’s. </B>The military version of the stonemason’s tool features a short, beaked spike
designed for punching through heavy armor. The horseman’s pick has a +1 bonus to
attacks against opponents in plate armor of any type. Many picks are equipped
with a hammer or axe blade on the reverse side of the head, and may be P/B or
P/S type weapons for a small cost increase.
<P></P>
<A NAME="8c75b92a"></A><B>Pick, footman’s. </B>A larger and heavier version of the horseman’s pick, the footman’s pick gains
a +2 bonus versus plate armors.
<P></P>
<A NAME="06a47b0b"></A><B>Pilum. </B>The famous javelin of the Roman legionaries, the pilum is forged with a long,
soft iron head. When a thrown pilum hits a shielded opponent or misses by only
one or two points, it sticks in the shield. The weapon’s weight bends the soft
iron head and makes the shield unusable until the pilum is removed—a process
that requires 1d6 combat rounds. Magical shields have a 20% chance per plus of
ignoring the pilum’s effects.
<P></P>
<A NAME="2e7bfecc"></A><B>Polearm. </B>Polearms are long, hafted weapons designed for two-handed use. Hundreds of
varieties exist, each with its own specialized function. In the Middle Ages,
polearms were introduced to give the foot soldier a weapon capable of dealing with
the heavily armored knight. They are more common on the battlefield than in
adventuring parties.
<P></P>
The first type of polearm are the spearlike weapons. These are primarily
thrusting weapons and are especially effective when set against charges. The pike is
a very long weapon with a small iron head; the ranseur, spetum, and partisan
are shorter weapons with side blades or spikes that give the user a +2 bonus on
any trap or block attempts. Partisans survived into the 19th century as
ceremonial weapons.
<P></P>
The next category of polearm are the pole axes. These are heavy weapons with
axe-like heads that are designed for maximum striking power. Poleaxes include
the bardiche, the halberd, and the voulge or Lochaber axe. Poleaxes gain a +2
bonus on attack rolls against any type of plate or mail armor.
<P></P>
<I>Glaives </I>are simple polearms that consist of a single long, curving blade used for both
slashing and thrusting. They lack the cutting power or strong straight point
of poleaxes or spearlike weapons, and are generally not as effective as the
previous weapons. Glaives include the glaive (naturally), the fauchard, and the
oriental nagimaki and naginata. As a side note, the nagimaki is actually a
horseman’s weapon.
<P></P>
<I>Bills </I>are multi-function polearms that include a cutting surface, a spearlike spike,
and hooks or curved blades on the back for dismounting riders. Bills,
bill-guisarmes, glaive-guisarmes, and guisarmes all fall into this category. All of
these weapons provide a +2 bonus to pull/trip attempts against riders.
<P></P>
The last category of polearms are weapons without a true category. These
specialized weapons can’t be classified as one of the above types. The bec de
corbin, or crow’s beak, is a weapon designed to pierce heavy armor; it gains a +3
bonus to attacks versus any kind of plate armor. The Lucern hammer is similar, but
uses a clawed hammer head instead of a single beak. It gains a +2 bonus to
attacks versus targets in plate armor. The military fork is nothing more than a
war version of the peasant’s pitchfork.
<P></P>
Last but not least, two oriental polearms fall into this catch-all category.
The lajatang is an unusual weapon with half-moon blades at either end; a
proficient user Threatens his flank spaces as well as his front squares. The tetsubo
is a kind of pole-mace with a heavy, iron-bound head.
<P></P>
<A NAME="4b61fcc5"></A><B>Pry bar. </B>Generally, a pry bar is a weapon of convenience, not choice. It can be used as
an effective bludgeon.
<P></P>
<A NAME="8d9a69dc"></A><B>Quarterstaff. </B>The staff is the favored weapon of travellers and peasants everywhere. Its
iron-shod ends are used to strike powerful blows or jab at an enemy. The oriental
bo stick resembles the quarterstaff in length and balance, but is used
differently. The quarterstaff suffers a –2 penalty to attacks against plate armor.
<P></P>
<A NAME="0000ffbf"></A><B>Sai. </B>The sai is a parrying weapon with a large crossguard. It resembles a dagger,
but the “blade” is round with no edges. It is normally used for bludgeoning
attacks. The sai’s crossguard provides a +2 bonus to any block, trap, or disarm
attempts.
<P></P>
<A NAME="d5c4a2d6"></A><B>Sang kauw. </B>This weapon resembles a short, double-ended spear with a buckler or bladed
guard at the center. It requires both hands but provides a proficient user with an
AC bonus of +1 due to the small shield. Like the lajatang, the sang kauw
threatens both of the wielder’s flank squares as well as his front spaces.
<P></P>
<A NAME="c3953202"></A><B>Sap. </B>The sap is a leather bag filled with sand or lead shot. It is used to render
an unsuspecting victim unconscious. Saps are only effective when used against
opponents in leather or lighter armors. To go for an instant knockout, the user
must make a called shot to the target’s head. If he hits, there is a 5% (40%
chance maximum) chance per point of damage that the victim is knocked out for 3d10
rounds. A target wearing a helm of any kind provides the attacker with an
additional –4 penalty in addition to the called shot penalty. A creature of size
Large or greater cannot be knocked out this way.

<P></P>
<A NAME="305f5d6e"></A><B>Scourge. </B>The scourge is a torturer’s weapon. It consists of a handle with several
leather whips, often studded with barbs, nails, or other similar devices. The
scourge’s whips can catch and grab an enemy’s weapon, and the wielder of the scourge
gains a +1 bonus on any disarm attempts.
<P></P>
<A NAME="36c0eb60"></A><B>Scythe. </B>Another tool converted into a weapon, the scythe mounts a curving blade
perpendicular to a long wooden haft. It was originally intended to be used for
harvesting grain, and is slow and awkward as a weapon.
<P></P>
<A NAME="afda23ad"></A><B>Shuriken. </B>Also known as <I>shaken </I>or <I>throwing stars</I>, shuriken come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The most common designs are
large throwing needles and flat, star-shaped blades. Shuriken are the favored
weapons of assassins in oriental campaigns.
<P></P>
<A NAME="37defa8f"></A><B>Sickle. </B>Like the scythe, the sickle is primarily a tool that occasionally sees use as
a weapon. The sickle’s curving blade is used for cutting crops for harvest, and
priests of nature or agriculture often use the sickle as a ceremonial weapon.
<P></P>
<A NAME="67905cc9"></A><B>Sledge hammer. </B>Sledges are used in construction and masonry work of all kinds. It is
generally too heavy and slow to be used as a weapon except in an emergency.
<P></P>
<A NAME="074487f9"></A><B>Sling. </B>One of the most common missile weapons is the humble sling. This is not a
child’s toy slingshot; this is a weapon that can hurl small stones or lead bullets
with lethal force. The sling is a simple length of cord or cloth with a cup in
the center. The projectile is placed in the cup, and the sling is whirled
rapidly in a sidearm or overhead motion. Slings can be improvised from many
materials, and are among the cheapest of weapons.
<P></P>
Slingstones can be found in any rocky landscape. Normally, small round rocks
are best, such as the type found in streambeds. Sling bullets are made of lead,
bronze, or iron, much like the bullets for a firearm.
<P></P>
<A NAME="074926cd"></A><B>Spade. </B>Shovels or spades can be used as a weapon of last resort if there is nothing
more warlike at hand. Folding military spades with sharpened blades were used in
hand to hand fighting in both World Wars.
<P></P>
<A NAME="0749433d"></A><B>Spear. </B>The spear is one of mankind’s oldest weapons. Literally thousands of
variations exist, but they all feature a head designed for stabbing or thrusting.
Throughout the Bronze Age and the years of the Roman Empire, the spear was the most
common weapon on the battlefield. In primitive settings, stone-headed spears are
common. The spear can be used either one-handed or two-handed.
<P></P>
<A NAME="c30f64a8"></A><B>Spear, long. </B>The long spear is nothing more than a heavier spear with a longer reach. A
normal spear ranges from 5–8 feet in length, but a long spear is about 10–12 feet
long. The longest weapon of this family is the pike, which was often 18–21 feet
in length. The long spear is a two-handed weapon.
<P></P>
<A NAME="e82ad768"></A><B>Staff sling. </B>The staff sling simply consists of a short wooden staff with a leather sling
at one end. It can be used to throw larger and heavier projectiles than a normal
sling, but can’t throw them as far or as accurately. The sling has no short
range category; instead, any shot from 0–12 squares away is considered a medium
range shot.
<P></P>
In addition to throwing stones, staff slings can also be used to throw <I>stinkpots</I>—small clay vessels filled with noxious burning materials. If a stinkpot
misses its target, it still scatters and breaks open (see Grenade-like missiles in
the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00445.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00445.htm.php.html">DMG</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">.) Any character within one square of a stinkpot hit must roll a successful
saving throw vs. death or suffer a –2 penalty to all attacks due to choking and
coughing for 1d6 combat rounds.
<P></P>
<A NAME="07520c49"></A><B>Sword. </B>Swords are the most efficient weapons of ancient times, combining ease of use
with excellent armor penetration. The earliest copper swords appeared thousands
of years before the rise of the Roman Empire, and ceremonial swords are
carried today by most of the world’s armies and navies.
<P></P>
Bastard swords are also known as hand-and-a-half swords. They are nothing more
than longer, heavier long swords. The extra weight of a bigger blade enabled
the sword’s wielder to hack through the heavier armor that appeared at the end
of the Crusades. Whether used one-handed or two-handed, the bastard sword gains
a +1 bonus to hit opponents in any type of mail or plate armor.
<P></P>
Broadswords have existed in a number of settings. Any medium-sized blade
designed for slashing can be called a broadsword. In ancient times, the best blades
fall into this category; by the Middle Ages, this describes a civilian’s sword
or a court blade. Later broadswords were built with basket hilts, which give
the weapon user a +1 bonus on any block attempts.
<P></P>
The claymore is a Scottish two-handed sword somewhat shorter than the true
two-handed sword. It is an excellently balanced weapon with fearsome cutting
power. The claymore gains a +1 bonus to hit opponents in any kind of leather, mail,
or plate armor.
<P></P>
The cutlass is a heavy, slightly curved, single-edged blade of medium length.
It was popular with sailors and marines for hundreds of years. Like some
broadswords, cutlasses were made with basket hilts.
<P></P>
The drusus is a Roman short sword of exceptional quality. It’s really nothing
more than a well-made gladius kept at a razor-honed edge. The weapon’s fine
quality provides a +1 bonus to attack rolls, but after any fight the weapon is
considered to be dulled and functions as a normal gladius until it is re-honed—a
task that requires a fully-equipped forge and a trained swordsmith.
<P></P>
The estoc is the grandfather of the rapier. It is an edgeless thrusting sword
designed for piercing armor. It gains a +2 bonus to attacks against opponents
in any kind of mail, and a +1 bonus to attacks against opponents in any kind of
plate armor. Estocs were often made with perfectly triangular or square blades.
<P></P>
The falchion is a slashing weapon with a slightly curved blade and a
squared-off point. It is nearly useless for thrusting, but its blade design concentrates
the weight of the blade near the end for excellent chopping power.
<P></P>
The traditional weapon of the Roman legionary was the gladius. It is basically
a well-made iron or steel short sword used almost exclusively for thrusting.
<P></P>
The samurai’s katana may be the single finest sword ever made. It is a
slashing weapon with a sharp, chisel-shaped point. The steel was often of exceptional
quality, built up with a laborious process of folding and re-folding; some
blades had hundreds of folds. This created a sword of tremendous resilience and
strength. The hilt accomodates one or two hands equally well.

The companion to the samurai’s katana is the wakizashi, a shorter blade of
similar construction and design. In eastern cultures, only a samurai may wear
these two blades together. It is very common for a katana and wakizashi to be
paired as a matched set.

The khopesh is an ancient weapon of the Bronze Age. Its blade runs straight
from the hilt, but then curves around in a great sickle shape. It is heavy and
awkward, but may be the only sword available in some settings.
<P></P>
The long sword is meant to represent the weapon of the typical western knight,
but also includes any medium-length straight blade designed for both slashing
and thrusting. The advent of heavy plate armor made the long sword obsolete;
longer, heavier blades were required to pierce a knight’s armor.
<P></P>
Just as the samurai has his traditional katana, the ninja has his ninja-to,
the traditional sword of the assassin. The ninja-to is smaller than the katana
and generally not as well made. Unlike the katana, the ninja-to features a larger
guard and a sturdy scabbard which can be used as a climbing step.
<P></P>
The largest oriental sword is the no-dachi, a two-handed katana-like weapon
almost six feet in length. Some no-dachi are built to the exacting specifications
of a katana, but most are not of the same quality.
<P></P>
One of the later swords to appear was the rapier, a light, long thrusting
weapon. The rapier was the gentleman’s weapon in the Renaissance and later
centuries, remaining in use until the 18th century. The rapier appeared largely because
armor was beginning to disappear from the battlefields of Europe.
<P></P>
Another duelist’s weapon is the sabre, a slightly curved slashing blade of
medium length. The sabre had one of the longest periods of service of any sword;
they appeared in Europe during the 11th century, and were still considered
standard issue for cavalrymen at the beginning of the 20th century.
<P></P>
The most ancient sword in this listing is the sapara, a weapon of the
Mesopotamian empires of the Bronze Age. The sapara is a smaller version of the khopesh,
and is no larger than a standard short sword.
<P></P>
One of the most distinctive swords is the scimitar, a gracefully curved weapon
favored by many Arabian cultures. The scimitar was carried by Muslim warriors
from Spain to India and became a symbol of the strength and subtlety of Islam.
The great scimitar, a two-handed version of the normal blade, was a weapon
reserved for ceremonial guards and elite palace troops.
<P></P>
By far the most common blade is the humble short sword. Thousands of varieties
have been created by nearly every culture on Earth. Regardless of the setting,
some equivalent to the standard short sword can be found. The short sword is
primarily a thrusting weapon, ranging from 11/2 to 21/2 feet in length.
<P></P>
The spatha is the ancestor of most Western European blades. It is the Roman
long sword, a weapon developed for Roman cavalry but soon copied by the
barbarians who fought against the Romans.
<P></P>
The sword-axe is not a true sword. It features a long wooden haft in place of
a hilt, and a sword blade with an axe-like construction at the business end. In
battle, it would be wielded more like an axe than a sword. It was a weapon of
ancient times that was soon replaced by more efficient blades.
<P></P>
The tulwar bears a small resemblance to the falchion, but is found in eastern
settings. Unlike the falchion, the tulwar curves inward for chopping power,
instead of outward for a longer slash. The famous Ghurka knife is a good example
of a tulwar-like blade.
<P></P>
The largest and most powerful sword is the two-handed sword, or <I>zweihander</I>. It was developed in the Renaissance to deal with pikemen and dismounted
knights. It often stood well over six feet tall. The two-handed sword gains a +2
bonus to attacks against opponents in any kind of mail or plate armor, since its
heavy blade can easily penetrate even the heaviest armor.
<P></P>
<A NAME="081a9879"></A><B>Three-piece rod. </B>It is said this weapon was invented by a master of the martial arts whose
staff had been broken by his enemy. The three-piece rod consists of three short
wooden staves, linked by rope or chain. It is exceptionally useful for performing
traps, blocks, and defensive disarms; the three-piece rod confers a +4 bonus to
any such attempts.
<P></P>
<A NAME="053474dc"></A><B>Throwing knife. </B>This terrifying weapon resembles a sword with three or four points. The handle
and lower part of the blade appear normal, but the blade forks several times
into a number of dagger-like points. It’s thrown horizontally, so that it spins
parallel to the ground. The throwing knife is usually considered a weapon of
savage cultures.
<P></P>
<A NAME="077c958c"></A><B>Torch. </B>Most torches can be used as serviceable clubs in a pinch. If the torch is
burning, it inflicts 1 extra point of damage. In addition, most animals fear open
flame and may avoid a character waving a burning torch around. Torches only
ignite very flammable substances, so normal clothes and the like won’t usually be
set afire by a single blow from a lit torch.
<P></P>
<A NAME="2b49493a"></A><B>Trident. </B>The trident is the famous three-pronged spear of seafarers and mercreatures.
Fishermen of many cultures use tridents as hunting weapons, but military
tridents are much more scarce.
<P></P>
<A NAME="5cc4ead4"></A><B>Two-handed axe. </B>This mighty weapon consists of a four- to five-foot haft with a very heavy
blade. The axe may be double-bitted, with blades on both sides of the haft, or it
may only have a single blade. It is an unwieldy weapon, but a skilled warrior
can strike blows of tremendous strength with it.
<P></P>
<A NAME="002ed15a"></A><B>Vial. </B>Vials aren’t particularly damaging by themselves, but when filled with acid or
holy water they’re somewhat more dangerous. When a vial is thrown at an
opponent, the attacker may ignore armor—only Dexterity and magical adjustments to AC
count for the defender. If the vial hits, the victim suffers the full damage of
whatever substance is inside. If it misses, it may still inflict damage with a
splash hit depending on where it lands (see Grenade-like Missiles in the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00445.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00445.htm.php.html">DMG</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">.)
<P></P>
<A NAME="6a62de0f"></A><B>War club. </B>The war club is considered a work of art in many cultures. It is carefully
built from the best materials available and often lined with sharp stones or
spikes to increase its damage potential. War clubs cannot be thrown.
<P></P>
<A NAME="3e96d59a"></A><B>Warhammer. </B>The warhammer is very similar in size and balance to the horseman’s pick, but
instead of a point for piercing armor the warhammer is equipped with a blunt
striking head. The warhammer gains a +1 bonus to attacks versus plate armors.
<P></P>
<A NAME="00300210"></A><B>Whip. </B>The whip cannot cause damage to an opponent in any kind of plate, mail, or
leather armors but can still be used to perform a number of special maneuvers. It
gains a +2 bonus to pull/trip and offensive disarm maneuvers. In addition, the
sting of the lash may force normal animals to retreat at the DM’s discretion.
