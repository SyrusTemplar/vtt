All characters must have an Intelligence score of at least 9 to become a
wizard. A new school might require a higher Intelligence score for specialization,
but only in the rarest circumstances should it be higher than 13.
<P></P>
All specializations require a minimum score in a secondary ability. This
minimum score should be at least 12, but no higher than 16. Wisdom, Constitution,
and Dexterity are the most common secondary ability requirements, but Charisma
and Strength are also possible. Remember that setting the ability requirements
high will keep the number of specialists low, and vice versa.
<P></P>
Because some of the somatic components for metamorphic spells require precise
execution, we will set a minimum Dexterity score of 15 for specialists in the
school of metamorphics
