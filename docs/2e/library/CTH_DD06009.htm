These belong most correctly in Kara-Tur, land of <I>Oriental Adventures</I> and ninja, but they could exist in any fantasy setting.

Water shoes are simply large, wickerwork basketlike devices which are worn
over the feet (and come to mid-calf height). The thief balances in an upright
position and propels himself across the water with a paddle or oar. The DM may
insist on a move silently check at some stage. If anything happens to startle the
thief (such as an arrow whizzing past his head or some monster rising up in the
water), a Dexterity test may be called for to avoid falling over into the water.
