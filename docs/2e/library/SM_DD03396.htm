deals in subtleties and suggestion, the invoker deals in naked force,
summoning and controlling massive energies. The invoker requires a Constitution
(Constitution/Fitness) score of 16 or better to withstand the physical stress of this
specialty. The school of invocation is opposed by enchantment/charm and
conjuration/summoning.
<P></P>
In addition to the normal advantages and disadvantages of specialization, the
invoker gains an additional +1 bonus to saving throws vs. invocation/evocation
spells when he reaches 8th level, for a total of +2. At 11th level, this
increases to +3. (These bonuses also apply to magical items that simulate invocation
spells, such as a wand of fire.) At 14th level, the invoker acquires immunity
to one invocation or evocation spell of 3rd level or lower of his choice;
however, this immunity does <I>not </I>extend to similar magical items or breath weapons.
<P></P>
The invoker is a valuable asset to the party on the battlefield, where his
spectacular spells can decimate hordes of low-level monsters or severely injure
tougher opponents. Unfortunately, fear of the invokerâ€™s firepower leads many
opponents to attack the wizard in the hope of disabling him before he can blast
them to ashes.
