<P></P>
This is a god of the good fortune and good luck that all sentient beings hope
will come their way. This is not a god of bad luck or ill fortune.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are practical, common-sense people. They'll help the
flock pray for luck. But they also recognize that a lot of luck is self-made.
They try to analyze the situations of supplicants who seem to have bad luck all
the time, and suggest ways for them to change their lives so that good luck is
more likely to shine on them. They even meddle to give luck a little push;
they'll contrive so that two people who can help each other accomplish a mutual goal
will meet, for example.
<P></P>
Lesser gods of this attribute will be gods of one particular type of luck. The
most popular gods of this type would be gods of gambling luck or luck with
romantic affairs.

Gods of luck are most likely to be female.
