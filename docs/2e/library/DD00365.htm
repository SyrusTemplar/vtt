If the DM consistently gives too little experience to players, they become
frustrated. Frustrated players don't have fun and, usually, quit the game. Even if
they don't quit, players can develop an
&quot;It-doesn't-matter-what-I-do-so-why-bother&quot; attitude. They stop trying to do their best, figuring they will only get
a measly amount of experience whether they play their best or just coast along.
<P></P>
On the other hand, players can be given too many experience points too
quickly. Players in this situation develop an
&quot;It-doesn't-matter-what-I-do-because-I'm-going-to-win&quot; attitude. They quit trying to be inventive and clever, and they
just get by.
<P></P>
Consequently, the DM must take care not to give characters too little
experience or too much. The best approach is to vary the awards given from game to
game, based on the actions of the characters. Players should be rewarded according
to how hard they try and how well they accomplish various goals.
<P></P>
Every game session should have a goal. Some goals are constant, applicable to
any AD&amp;D game. Others are dependent on the individual campaign, storyline,
character levels, and specific adventure. All goals should be clear, understandable
ones that players can see or decipher from clues they get during play.
