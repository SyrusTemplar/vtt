As you'll recall (from the <B>DMG</B>, pages 33, 34), priest spells are divided into categories called <I>spheres of influence.</I> Each spell belongs to one of 16 categories. Those categories include:
<P></P>
All, Animal, Astral, Charm, Combat, Creation, Divination, Elemental, Guardian,
Healing, Necromantic, Plant, Protection, Summoning, Sun, and Weather.
<P></P>
Priests can't cast spells from all spheres of influence. Any specific
priesthood can have <I>major access</I> to one or several spheres, and thus eventually learn to cast spells of any
level from that sphere, and can have <I>minor access</I> to one or several other spheres, and learn to cast spells from only 1st
through 3rd level in that sphere.
<P></P>
When designing a new priesthood, the DM decides which spheres of influence the
priesthood has.
<P></P>
All priesthoods should have major access to the All sphere. Beyond that, the
DM should choose a number of spheres, and the access to each, based on the
attributes of the god being served, and on how combat-efficient the priest is
already.
<P></P>
If a priesthood currently has access to good armor and a wide range of
weapons, the DM should limit the range of spells available to them. If, however, the
priests do not have access to mighty engines of war, the DM may want them to
have a greater ability with magic, reflected by access to more spheres, and major
access to a greater proportion of them.
<P></P>
Priests should have Major access to just about any sphere that has any bearing
on the primary attribute of their god, and at least Minor access to spheres
which have a lesser relationship to their god. (For instance, priests of a God of
War who is noted for his protectiveness might have minor, or even major,
access to the Guardian and Protection spheres.)
<P></P>
Here are some rules of thumb to go by when assigning Spheres of Influence to
specific priesthoods:
<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
If a priesthood is allowed to use metal armors and a good range of weapons, we
consider that it has good combat abilities. Therefore, it should have less
effective magic, including:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I> Major Access To:</I> The &quot;All&quot; Sphere, and two other Spheres.
<P></P>
<I> Minor Access To:</I> Two Spheres.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>The Priesthood Has Medium Combat Abilities</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
If a priesthood is allowed to use metal armors but restricted to a poor range
of weapons, or is not allowed to use metal armors but has access to a good
range of weapons, we consider that it has medium combat abilities. It should have a
more average access to magic, including:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Major Access To:</I> The &quot;All&quot; Sphere, and four other Spheres.
<P></P>
<I> Minor Access To:</I> Four Spheres.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>The Priesthood Has Poor Combat Abilities</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
If the priesthood is not allowed to use metal armors (or even<I> any</I> armors) and has access to a poor range of weapons, we say that it has poor
combat abilities. It should have an enhanced access to magic, including:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Major Access To:</I> The &quot;All&quot; Sphere, and six other Spheres.
<P></P>
<I>Minor Access To:</I> Six Spheres.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Some Definitions</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
&quot;A good range of weapons&quot; is not a very precise definition, but it's harder to
be more precise; what is and is not considered a good range varies with each
individual DM. In general, if the priesthood is allowed access to five or more
different types of weapons (a bow isn't that different from a crossbow for our
purposes, but a mace is different from a spear), or if the priesthood is limited
to a few efficient and high-damage (1d8 and better) weapons (such as swords),
we say that it has a <I>good </I>range of available weapons.
<P></P>
&quot;A poor range of weapons&quot; is just as imprecise. In general, if the priesthood
is allowed access to four or fewer different types of weapons, or has access to
a greater number of weapons which do no more than 1d6+1 damage, we say that it
has a <I>poor </I>range of available weapons.
<P></P>
If a priesthood doesn't allow the priest access to the full number of spheres
appropriate to that type of priesthood, then the DM should supplement the
priesthood with extra Granted Powers. For instance, if a priesthood has Good Combat
Abilities but is designed with major access to the All sphere and <I>only </I>one other sphere, and minor access to two spheres, then the priesthood is
receiving less abilities than it should; it should be given some minor Granted
Power to compensate.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Now, this valiant effort to keep combat abilities and magical abilities
balanced is substantially thwarted by the original Cleric class himself. The Cleric
has major access to 12 Spheres, minor access to one, and the ability to wear
metal armors. In short, he is more powerful than just about any more restrictive
priesthood.
<P></P>
If the players in a campaign are likely not to take priests of specific
mythoi simply because the original Cleric class is more powerful, the DM may wish
to revise the Cleric in his campaign. For more on this, see &quot;<A HREF="DD05656.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD05656.htm">Toning Down the Cleric</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">&quot; in the Role-Playing chapter.
