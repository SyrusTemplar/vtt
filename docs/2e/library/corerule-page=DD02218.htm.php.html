The <I>plant door</I> spell opens a magical portal or passageway through trees, undergrowth,
thickets, or any similar growth--even growth of a magical nature. The plant door is
open to the caster who cast the spell, casters of a higher level, or dryads;
others must be shown the location of the door. The door even enables the caster to
enter a solid tree trunk and remain hidden there until the spell ends. The
spell also enables the passage or hiding of any man-sized or smaller creature;
hiding is subject to space considerations. If the tree is cut down or burned,
those within must leave before the tree falls or is consumed, or else they are
killed also. The duration of the spell is one turn per level of experience of the
caster. If the caster opts to stay within an oak, the spell lasts nine times
longer than normal; if within an ash tree, it lasts three times longer. The path
created by the spell is up to 4 feet wide, 8 feet high, and 12 feet long per
level of experience of the caster. This spell does not function on plant-based
monsters (shambling mounds, molds, slimes, treants, etc.).

The material components for this spell are a piece of charcoal and the
caster's holy symbol.
