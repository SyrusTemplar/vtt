</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The necromancer has engaged in research to augment his or her physical and
mental attributes, raising them above their normal scores (by means of discovered <I>wishes</I>, magical tomes, enchanted pools, and so on). This research results in a total
of 1–3 additional point, which may be distributed by the DM among the
necromancer’s ability scores. Alternatively, the DM may distribute each additional
ability point by randomly rolling a d12: 1) Strength; 2–5) Intelligence; 6–7)
Wisdom; 8–9) Dexterity; 10–11) Constitution; 12) Charisma.
