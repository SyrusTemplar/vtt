With access to any spell and the ability to continuously improve their spell
abilities, bards are not very far behind wizards in terms of sheer magical
power. While they do not gain spell abilities until they reach 2nd level, they
always use their actual character level for calculating level-based effects in a
spell; they have no separate “casting level,” like rangers and paladins.

Bards often employ a different system of magic than wizards, since their
spells can represent ancient songs or enchantments woven from the interplay of
voice, instrument, and dance. Certainly, some systems of magic—alienists or
warlocks, for instance—would be inappropriate for the bard’s magical skills. The bard’s
spell point progression is described in <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03552.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03552.htm.php.html">Table 36</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> : Bard Spell Point Progression.

Generally, bards follow the rules described for <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03506.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03506.htm.php.html">wizards</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> in this chapter for memorizing and casting spells. Like wizards, they may
devote extra spell points to memorize free magicks, memorize spells for greater
effect, use spells at reduced cost, and any other options the DM deems
appropriate. Bards are limited to seven spells of any one level, but continue to gain
spell points after they reach 20th level.
