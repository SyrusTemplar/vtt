<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Disguise:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Characters trained in this proficiency can conceal their appearance through
makeup and costuming. If they seek simply to alter their appearance without
concealing size, sex, or race—for example, to go out in a city without anyone
discovering what they look like—they can succeed without a proficiency check.
<P></P>
If the task is more difficult—the character in disguise meets and talks with
an acquaintance, for example—a successful proficiency check is required.
Characters who try to alter the appearance of their sex, race, or size, must make
successful proficiency checks with a –2 penalty for each category.
<P></P>
Characters who attempt to disguise themselves as specific persons must make
proficiency checks when they encounter and speak with someone who knows the other
individuals. All of these checks suffer an inherent –2 penalty.

Note that the talent of impersonation (<A HREF="DD03099.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03099.htm">see traits</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) can improve a character’s success with the disguise proficiency.
