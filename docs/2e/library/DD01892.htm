The victim of this spell perceives everything as hilariously funny. The effect
is not immediate, and the creature feels only a slight tingling on the round
the spell is cast. On the round immediately following, the victim begins
smiling, then giggling, chuckling, tittering, snickering, guffawing, and finally
collapsing into gales of uncontrollable, hideous laughter. Although this magical
mirth lasts only a single round, the affected creature must spend the next round
regaining its feet, and it loses 2 points from its Strength (or -2 to attack and
damage rolls) for all remaining rounds of the spell.
<P></P>
The saving throw vs. spell is modified by the Intelligence of the creature.
Creatures with Intelligences of 4 or less (semi-intelligent) are totally
unaffected. Those with Intelligences of 5-7 (low) save with -6 penalties. Those with
Intelligences of 8-12 (average to very) save with -4 penalties. Those with
Intelligences of 13-14 (high) save with -2 penalties. Those with Intelligences of 15
or greater (exceptional) have unmodified saving throws.
<P></P>
The caster can affect one creature for every three levels attained--for
example, one at 3rd level, two at 6th level, three at 9th level, etc. All affected
beings must be within 30 feet of each other.
<P></P>
The material components are a small feather and minute tarts. The tarts are
hurled at the subjects, while the feather is waved in one hand.
