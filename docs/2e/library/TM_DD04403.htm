<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
This powerful spell affects all enemies of the spellcasting priest who enter
the area of effect. The spell inflicts a -2 penalty on saving throws, a -1
penalty to armor class, and a -1 penalty to attack and damage rolls. Creatures
friendly to the cleric gain corresponding bonuses--+2 to saving throws, +1 to attack
and damage rolls, and a bonus of 1 to AC. Additional effects are possible,
depending on the Power granting the spell; effects must correspond (or at least
not conflict) with the spheres the priest normally uses. Multiple effects are
possible.
<P></P>
The variation for the Sphere of Wards requires that each hostile creature
entering the area of effect make a saving throw vs. spells with a -4 penalty or
suffer 4d6 points of damage. An affected creature must then flee the area; it is
unable to return. The creature must make a second saving throw vs. spell with a
-4 penalty as it leaves the area or be blinded until magically cured.
<P></P>
The variation for the sphere of Law requires that a hostile creature make a
saving throw every time it wishes to change an action. Thus, if a creature wishes
to stop running and draw a weapon, a successful save is needed or the creature
continues to run. Actions that cannot be continued (e.g., firing an arrow if
the archer has no more arrows) are repeated as empty automatisms. In addition,
creatures hostile to the priest automatically fail saving throws against
Enchantment/Charm spells cast by the priest.
<P></P>
The variation for the Sphere of Chaos requires that hostile creatures make
saving throws vs. spells at -4 or be affected by <I>confusion</I> (as per the spell). Affected creatures have a 5% chance per round of suddenly
being attacked by a <I>phantasmal killer</I>.
<P></P>
All creatures who enter the area of effect are subject to the effects of the
spell. All effects except blindness cease 3 rounds after an affected creature
leaves the area. Creatures reentering the area of effect must make new saving
throws.
