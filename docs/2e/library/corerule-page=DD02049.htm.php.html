The <I>stone to flesh</I> spell turns any sort of stone into flesh. If the recipient stone object was
formerly living, this spell restores life (and goods), although the survival of
the creature is subject to the usual system shock survival roll. Any formerly
living creature, regardless of size, can be thus returned to flesh. Ordinary
stone can be turned to flesh in a volume of 9 cubic feet per level of experience
of the spellcaster. Such flesh is inert, lacking a vital life force, unless a
life force or magical energy is available (for example, this spell would turn a
stone golem into a flesh golem, but an ordinary statue would become a body). If
cast upon stone, the wizard can create a cylinder of fleshy material from 1 to
3 feet in diameter and up to 10 feet long, allowing a passage to be made.
<P></P>
The material components are a pinch of earth and a drop of blood.
<P></P>
The reverse, <I>flesh to stone,</I> turns flesh of any sort to stone. All possessions on the person of the
creature likewise turn to stone. The intended subject of the spell receives a saving
throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If a statue created by this spell is
subjected to breakage or weathering, the being (if ever returned to his original,
fleshy state) will have similar damage, deformities, etc. The DM may allow such
damage to be repaired by various high-level clerical spells, such as <I>regenerate</I>.
<P></P>
The material components of the spell are lime, water, and earth.
