</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This attack stabs the mind of the defender, piercing thoughts and memories.
For every 2 PSPs put into the attack (declared after a successful attack roll is
made), the attacker rolls 1d4 to determine psionic damage against his foe. If
hit, the defender loses that many PSPs or has his mind opened to further psionic
contact if no PSPs remain. A failed attack costs 1 PSP.
<P></P>
Mind thrust has three ranges: short (30 yards), medium (60 yards), and long
(90 yards). At medium range, the defender receives a +2 bonus to his MAC; at long
range, the bonus is +5.
<P></P>
If used against an open mind, mind thrust causes the target to lose the use of
one psionic power (chosen randomly) for 1d6 days. While no psionic defenses
remain, the attacker must still roll the defender's MAC to successfully hit (with
a +2 bonus to the attack roll). This use of the attack costs 2 PSPs. Beyond
opening a closed mind, mind thrust has no effect on nonpsionic minds.
