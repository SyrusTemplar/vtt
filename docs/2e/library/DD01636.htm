<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A natural desire is to have your character own one of everything. Thus
equipped, your character could just reach into his pack and pull out any item he wants
whenever he needs it. Sadly, there are limits to how much your character, his
horse, his mule, his elephant, or his whatever can carry. These limits are
determined by <I>encumbrance.</I>
<P></P>
Encumbrance is measured in pounds. To calculate encumbrance, simply total the
pounds of gear carried by the creature or character. Add five pounds for
clothing, if any is worn. This total is then compared to the carrying capacity of the
creature to determine the effects. In general, the more weight carried, the
slower the movement and the worse the character is at fighting.
