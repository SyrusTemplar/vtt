<FONT SIZE="3">This spell conjures a small horde of semitangible
magical orbs or eyes that can be used to reconnoiter an area at the
wizard&#146;s command. Each of the eyes is about the size of a small
apple and can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions. In
order to report their findings, the eyes must return to the
caster&#146;s hand to replay in the caster&#146;s mind everything
they have seen during their existence. The eyes are subject to
illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect the
wizard&#146;s ability to receive visual information about his
surroundings. The eyes only see as a normal human would&#151;abilities
and spell effects including infravision do not alter the eyes&#146;
vision. It only takes the eye one round to replay one hour of
recorded images.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The spell conjures 1d4 eyes, plus 1 eye per caster
level. The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level, or until
they return to the wizard; after relaying its findings, an eye
disappears. Each eye is AC 4, flies by levitation at a rate of 12,
and has only 1 hit point&#151;a single hit from any weapon or
damaging spell destroys it. A successful <I>dispel magic </I>destroys
all eyes caught in the area of effect. While the individual eyes are
quite fragile, they&#146;re small and difficult to spot, especially
in conditions of poor visibility such as darkness, fog, or rain. Of
course, if the eye is being sent into darkness, then it&#146;s very
possible that it could hit a wall or other similar obstacle and
destroy itself.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">When the wizard creates the eyes, he can specify any
set of instructions or orders that he wishes, up to 25 words. Any
knowledge the wizard possesses is assumed to be known by the eyes as
well, so if the wizard knows what a typical Jakallian merchant looks
like, the eyes do as well. Sample commands might be, &#147;Surround
me at a range of 400 yards and return if you spot any dangerous
creatures,&#148; or &#147;Spread out and search the town for Arweth;
follow him for three turns, staying out of sight, and then
return.&#148; Note that in the first command, the eye only returns if
it spots a creature that the wizard would regard as dangerous; a
seemingly innocuous peasant that is actually a <I>shapechanged </I>dragon
wouldn&#146;t trigger the eye&#146;s return. In any event, if an eye
is ever more than one mile distant from the wizard, it instantly
ceases to exist. However, the wizard&#146;s link with the eye is such
that he won&#146;t know if the eye was destroyed or if it just
wandered out of range.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Some command words can be used to abbreviate the
directions. For example, &#147;surround me&#148; directs the eyes to
form an equally-spaced ring at whatever range is indicated, and then
move with the wizard. As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest
automatically space themselves to compensate. &#147;Spread out&#148;
directs the eyes to move away from the wizard in all directions.
Other commands that might be useful include having them form a line
in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain
range, or have them follow a certain type of creature. The DM is the
final judge of the suitability of the wizard&#146;s directions.</FONT></P>
