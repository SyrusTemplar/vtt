<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wand of Metal and Mineral Detection:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This wand has a 30-foot radius range. It pulses in the wielder's hand and
points to the largest mass of metal within its effective area of operation.
However, the wielder can concentrate on a specific metal or mineral (gold, platinum,
quartz, beryl, diamond, corundum, etc.). If the specific mineral is within
range, the wand will point to any and all places it is located, and the wand
possessor will know the approximate quantity as well. Each operation requires one
round. Each charge powers the wand for two full turns. The wand may be recharged.
