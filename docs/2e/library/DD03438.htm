Optional Limitations for Bards</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Awkward casting method (5): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The bard-s spells require either loud singing or the strong playing of an
instrument of some kind, making it impossible to cast spells discretely or quietly.
He will almost never be able to cast spells without revealing a place of
concealment or tipping off an ambush.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Opposition school (5+): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The bard may not make use of spells from one philosophical school of magic or
make use of magical items that duplicate that school-s effects. (Schools that
are in opposition to any specialty schools of the character can-t be selected
for this restriction.) For each opposing school of philosophy, the character may
take a 5-point restriction.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Reduced spell power (10): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Since he is not a true wizard, the bard-s spells are of less power than a
wizard-s. For purposes of all level-based characteristics (range, duration, area of
effect, damage, and so on), a bard of 2nd?5th level effective casting level is
one level lower, a 6th?9th level bard-s effective casting level is two levels
lower, and a bard of 10th level or higher casts spells as if he were three
levels lower.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Reduced spell progression (15): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The bard can cast one less spell at each level than normal. For example, a
4th-level bard may normally memorize two 1st-level and one 2nd-level spell; with
this restriction, he is reduced to memorizing only one 1st-level spell.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Unreliable casting method (5): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The bard-s unorthodox approach to magic results in occasional failures, with
spells just fizzling instead of taking effect. The chance for failure is 10% per
spell level, less 2% per experience level. For example, a 6th-level bard
casting a 2nd-level spell would have an 8% chance (20 minus 12) of failure.
