By means of this spell, the wizard is able to place another spell upon his
person so that the latter spell will come into effect under the conditions
dictated during the casting of the <I>contingency</I> spell. The <I>contingency</I> spell and the spell it is to bring into effect are cast at the same time (the
one-turn casting time indicated is the total for both castings).
<P></P>
The spell to be brought into effect by the prescribed contingency must be one
that affects the wizard's person (<I>feather fall, levitation, fly, feign death,</I> etc.) and be of a spell level no higher than 1/3 of the caster's experience
level (rounded down), but not higher than the 6th spell level.

</B> Only one <I>contingency</I> spell can be placed on the spellcaster at any one time; if a second is cast,
the first one (if still active) is cancelled. The conditions needed to bring
the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be rather general. For
example, a <I>contingency</I> spell cast with an <I>airy water</I> spell might prescribe that any time the wizard is plunged into or otherwise
engulfed in water or similar liquid, the <I>airy water</I> spell will instantly come into effect. Or a contingency could bring a <I>feather fall</I> spell into effect any time the wizard falls more than 2 feet. In all cases,
the contingency immediately brings into effect the second spell, the latter
being -cast? instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. Note that if
complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell complex
(the <I>contingency</I> spell and the companion magic) may fail when called upon.
<P></P>
The material components of this spell are (in addition to those of the
companion spell) 100 gp worth of quicksilver and an eyelash of an ogre mage, ki-rin,
or similar spell-using creature. In addition, the spell requires a statuette of
the wizard carved from elephant ivory (which is not destroyed, though it is
subject to wear and tear), which must be carried on the person of the spellcaster
for the <I>contingency</I> spell to perform its function when called upon.
