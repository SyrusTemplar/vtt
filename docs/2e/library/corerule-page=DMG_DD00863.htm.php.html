<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wand of Polymorphing:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This wand emits a thin, green beam that darts forth a maximum distance of 60
yards. Any creature touched by this beam must make a saving throw vs. wands
(success indicating a miss) or be <I> polymorphed</I> (as the <I>polymorph others</I> spell). The wielder may opt to turn the victim into a snail, frog, insect,
etc., as long as the result is a small and inoffensive creature.
<P></P>
The possessor of the wand may elect to touch a creature with the device
instead. Unwilling creatures must be hit and are also entitled to a saving throw. If
the touch is successful, the recipient is surrounded by dancing motes of
sparkling emerald light, and then transforms into whatever creature-shape the wielder
wants. This is the same magical effect as the <I>polymorph self</I> spell.
<P></P>
Either function has an initiative modifier of +3. Each draws one charge. Only
one function per round is possible. The wand may be recharged.
