As you saw in the<I> Player's Handbook</I>, everybody knows how to punch and wrestle.
<P></P>
Martial Arts, however, are another matter. Not every character in a normal
medieval-style campaign will know how to utilize oriental-style Martial Arts.
<P></P>
The Martial Arts described in this section aren't any real-world fighting
style; they're a combination of &quot;generic&quot; martial-arts maneuvers in the tradition
of martial-arts movies.
<P></P>
These Martial Arts are only available in a campaign if the DM decides that the
art is available for characters to learn. He must first decide if he wants
characters to be able to use these maneuvers in his campaign, which will tend to
give the campaign a more oriental flavor; then, if he wishes to use them, he
needs to establish a history for these combat abilities. Customarily, they've been
developed by some distant civilization, and recent trade with that culture has
brought some practitioners and teachers of the art to the player-characters'
society.
<P></P>
To learn Martial Arts at its basic level, the character spends one Weapon
Proficiency slot on Martial Arts. Once he has spent that slot, he can use Martial
Arts in the same way that other people use Punching and Wrestling, as we'll
describe immediately below.
