In desperate situations, a character can parry with a missile weapon he is
holding (bow, crossbow, or staff sling, but not sling). If he is successful with
his parry, though, his weapon is ruined; the enemy's attack has destroyed it. He
may continue parrying with it until it is completely destroyed (rules for
destroying weapons and armor appear in the <I>Equipment</I> chapter of this book), but it may never again be used for its original
purpose.
