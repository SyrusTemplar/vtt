   <B>Description:</B> The Falconer is an expert in the handling and training of falcons, birds of
prey capable of learning an impressive range of tricks and tasks. Under the
direction of a skilled Falconer, a falcon can be taught to snatch a coin purse from
a victim's belt, bring down game birds in mid-flight, and fight effectively
against creatures many times its size. In addition to his expertise as a bird
trainer, the Falconer excels as a hunter and outdoorsman.
<P></P>
   <B>Requirements:</B> Standard.
<P></P>
   <B>Primary Terrain:</B><I> Required: </I>The Falconer must choose a primary terrain where falcons are most commonly
found: Desert, Forest, Hill, Mountain, or Plains.
<P></P>
   <B>Role:</B> Many Falconers serve as retainers of kings or nobles. Others freelance as
guides and mercenaries. Some stage public performances in rented halls or on
street corners, demonstrating their birds' remarkable stunts for appreciative
crowds. Regardless of how they make a living, Falconers are held in high regard by
most people, who never fail to be impressed by the Falconer's amazing rapport
with his birds.
<P></P>
   As falcons are extremely sensitive creatures, most Falconers by necessity must
be even-tempered, patient, and self-assured. These traits also make the
Falconer a valuable asset to an adventuring party. The Falconer's comrades will
usually find him dependable and supportive, though perhaps a bit preoccupied with
the needs of his bird. Sometimes falconers will have traits much like their
birds--fierce, swift, and observant.
<P></P>
   In combat, the Falconer fights aggressively, he and his falcon generally
conducting their attacks against the same opponent. If his falcon and a human
companion are both threatened, the Falconer will often choose to defend his falcon.
To prevent misunderstandings, an honorable Falconer will make it clear where his
loyalties lie before he joins an adventuring party.
<P></P>
   <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Bowyer/Fletcher, Forester, Groom, Hunter, Leather worker, Trader.
<P></P>
<B>   Weapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Required:</I> A Falconer must take two of his initial weapon proficiency slots in any of
the following: bow (any), crossbow (light), dagger, knife, sling, spear. The
remaining slots, as well as all subsequent slots, can be used for any weapon of the
Falconer's choice.
<P></P>
   <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonus:</I> Falconry*.<I> Recommended:</I> Alertness*, Bowyer/Fletcher, Endurance, Hunting, Leatherworking, Veterinary
Medicine*.
<P></P>
   <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> A Falconer has no special armor or equipment requirements. However, each
falcon he trains requires a set of falconry training equipment (see Chapter 7).
<P></P>
   <B>Species Enemy:</B> Any.
<P></P>
   <B>Followers:</B> Unlike other rangers, a Falconer receives an allotment of 3d6 followers,
determined at 1st level. The falconer immediately receives a falcon follower at
this time, which counts against his allotment. This falcon will be exceptionally
strong and able. The DM may use the statistics in the Falconry proficiency
description (see Chapter 5) for the initial falcon follower, as well as for any
subsequent falcon followers.
<P></P>
  Until 10th level, a Falconer can only have one follower, and that follower
must be a falcon. If the falcon follower dies or is otherwise lost, a new falcon
follower will arrive in accordance with the guidelines in Chapter 3. The new
falcon counts against the 3d6 allotment.
<P></P>
   A Falconer becomes eligible to receive followers other than falcons when he
reaches 10th level. At 10th level and beyond, the Falconer may have more than one
falcon among his followers, depending on the circumstances of the campaign and
decision of the DM.
<P></P>
   <I>Important Note:</I> Remember that a Falconer's follower will be a bird of rare and remarkable
characteristics and loyalty. The Falconer can also train lesser birds for himself
or others, using the standard training rules.
<P></P>
   <B>Special Benefits:
<P></P>
</B>   <I>Enhanced Training:</I> If a normal falcon has failed to learn a trick or task and become
untrainable, the Falconer can try again after gaining a level.
<P></P>
   <I>Attuned Follower:</I> Under certain conditions, a Falconer is able to establish an exceptionally
strong bond with a falcon follower. The bond enables the falcon to learn more
efficiently, and enhances communication between the falcon and the Falconer.
<P></P>
   Whenever a Falconer acquires a new falcon follower, including the falcon he
receives at 1st level, the falcon may be trained as a normal follower (see
Chapter 3). However, once the Falconer begins to train the falcon (using either the
Standard or Alternate method), the falcon cannot become attuned.
<P></P>
   Otherwise, the Falconer can forego training until he attempts to become
attuned to the new falcon. The attuning attempt takes six weeks. For at least an hour
each day, the Falconer talks to the bird, strokes its feathers, and engages in
other nurturing behavior. The bird learns to respond to the Falconer's voice,
though the Falconer refrains from teaching it any specific tricks or tasks
during this time. (In combat encounters which take place in this period, the falcon
will fly to safety at the first sign of trouble, then return to the Falconer's
shoulder when all's clear).
<P></P>
   At the end of the six-week period, the Falconer makes a Wisdom check. If the
check fails, the attuning attempt has likewise failed. The falcon continues its
relationship with the Falconer as a normal follower. The Falconer may begin to
train the falcon according to either the Standard or Alternate method described
in Chapter 3. The Falconer can't make a second attempt to attune the falcon.
<P></P>
   If the check succeeds, the falcon is attuned. Normally, the Falconer can teach
the attuned falcon a task or trick each time he gains a level, at the same
time he undergoes his own level training. The Falconer may also use the normal
training rule, either the Standard or Alternative method. Training time is half
that given in the falconry proficiency (see Chapter 5). Regardless how it is
trained, an attuned falcon can learn tricks or tasks in any combination, up to one
per level of the falconer. An attuned falcon never becomes untrainable.
<P></P>
   Additionally, once a falcon becomes attuned, it receives a one-time hit point
bonus equal to twice the Falconer's level. For example, if a falcon becomes
attuned to a 3rd level Falconer, the falcon receives a bonus of 6 hit points. This
bonus remains the same, even if the Falconer later advances in level.
<P></P>
   The following benefits apply only to a Falconer and an attuned falcon.
<P></P>
  <I> Fearless Falcon:</I> When fighting on behalf of a Falconer or under a Falconer's direction, an
attuned falcon never needs to make a morale check.
<P></P>
   <I>Falcon Species Enemy:</I> An attuned falcon has its own species enemy. When a falcon follower becomes
attuned, determine its species enemy, either by rolling on the appropriate table
in Chapter 2 (Tables 20-27), or by the DM choosing a particular enemy. The
falcon and ranger may share the same species enemy. The falcon has all of the
species enemy bonuses and penalties described in Chapter 2.
<P></P>
   <I>Attack Bonus:</I> An attuned falcon receives a +2 bonus to all attack rolls, except when
fighting its species enemy (when it receives a +4 bonus).
<P></P>
   <I>Speak With Falcon: </I>A Falconer who reaches 10th level acquires the ability to speak with an
attuned falcon follower. The ability is similar to the 2nd level priest spell speak
with animals, except it requires no components or casting time, and the Falconer
can do so at will.
<P></P>
   <I>Mental Communication:</I> At 15th level, the Falconer can communicate mentally with an attuned falcon
follower. Both the Falconer and attuned falcon can send and receive thoughts at
will, up to a distance of 100 yards per level of the Falconer. Walls or other
physical boundaries have no effect on this ability.
<P></P>
   <B>Special Hindrances:</B> If an attuned falcon dies, or is lost for any other reason, the Falconer
succumbs to grief and despair for 1-4 weeks. During this period of mourning, the
Falconer makes all attack rolls and ability checks at a -2 penalty. Additionally,
during this period, no new followers can be acquired, nor can the Falconer use
the <I>animal empathy</I> ability.
