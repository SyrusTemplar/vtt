Creatures affected by this spell hesitate before executing their intended
actions. This causes them to modify their initiative rolls by +4. The initiative
modifier occurs in the round following the round in which <I>hesitation</I> is cast.

The spell affects 2-8 Hit Dice or levels of creatures, although only one
creature of 4 or more Hit Dice can be affected regardless of the number rolled. All
possible victims are allowed saving throws vs. spells; those failing their
saving throws modify their initiative rolls by +4 for a number of rounds equal to
the caster's level.
