In order to use the <I>shadow walk</I> spell, the wizard must be in an area of heavy shadows. The caster and any
creature he touches are then transported to the edge of the Prime Material Plane
where it borders the Demiplane of Shadow. In this region, the wizard can move at
a rate of up to 7 miles per turn, moving normally on the borders of the
Demiplane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Prime Material Plane. Thus,
a wizard can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Demiplane
of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Prime
Material Plane. The wizard knows where he will come out on the Prime Material
Plane.
<P></P>
The <I>shadow walk</I> spell can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Demiplane
of Shadow, but this requires the potentially perilous transit of the Demiplane
of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality.
<P></P>
Any creatures touched by the wizard when <I>shadow walk</I> is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Demiplane of Shadow.
They may opt to follow the wizard, wander off through the plane, or stumble back
into the Prime Material Plane (50% chance for either result if they are lost
or abandoned by the wizard). Creatures unwilling to accompany the wizard into
the Demiplane of Shadow receive a saving throw, negating the effect if successful.
