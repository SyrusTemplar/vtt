</B> Controlling the flow of money is an important way of balancing your campaign.
Too much--or two little--money can ruin the fun of your game. Give your
characters mountains of gold and game is spoiled. Suddenly wealthy, they no longer
have the urgent need to adventure that impending poverty can provide. Too often
they can buy their way out of difficult situations through bribery or &quot;throwing
money at the problem.&quot;
<P></P>
Worse still, they attempt to apply modern, capitalist ideas to a
quasi-medieval world. They may try to hire an enormous staff of wizards to mass produce
potions and scrolls. They may set up shops to make assembly-line armor. Advances in
organization and production like these come slowly over time, not all at once.
You may have to remind your players to limit themselves to the knowledge and
attitudes of the times.
<P></P>
It is equally bad to keep your characters too poor. You are creating a game
world for a fantasy role-playing game. If the characters are so poor that they
must count every penny they spend, they are leading squalid and unhappy lives.
Reward them when they accomplish things. You shouldn't always frustrate their
desire to get rich. It's just that wealth should come slowly, matched to the level
of the character.
