<A NAME="52a5cf0a"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Allergies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This disadvantage is typically a hay fever problem, where the character is
subject to sneezing outdoors. The actual campaign environment makes a great deal
of difference?in winter settings, this isn?t much of a problem, for example.
The DM should be careful to create some settings where the character?s allergies
are in fact a disadvantage.
<P></P>
The game effects of allergies can come up in several ways. A Wisdom/Willpower
check can be called upon to stifle a sneeze when the character?s party is
setting up an ambush along a forest trail. If the character suffers from severe
allergies, his Strength/Stamina score and Constitution/Health scores must be
reduced by 1?6 points when the pollen count is high.
<P></P>
Other allergies can be created. A character who is allergic to mold, for
example, might suffer these same effects when in a damp, underground location. As
well, he might suffer double damage from mold-based attacks. An allergy to bee
stings or to certain types of food or animals are less likely to affect the game,
but the DM could offer to negotiate a lower character point bonus for the
character who has a lesser allergy as a disadvantage.
