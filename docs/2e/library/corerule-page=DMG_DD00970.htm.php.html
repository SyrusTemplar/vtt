<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Horn of Blasting:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This magical horn appears to be a normal trumpet, but it radiates magic if a <I>detect magic</I> is cast upon it. It can be sounded as a normal horn, but if the correct word
is spoken and the instrument is then played, it has the following effects, both
of which happen at once:
<P></P>
1. A cone of sound, 120 feet long and 30 feet wide at the end, issues forth
from the horn. All within this area must roll a successful saving throw vs.
spell. Those saving are stunned for one round and deafened for two. Those failing
the saving throw sustain 1d10 points of damage, are stunned for two rounds, and
deafened for four.
<P></P>
2. A wave of ultrasonic sound 1 foot wide and 100 feet long issues from the
horn. This causes a weakening of such materials as metal, stone, and wood. The
weakening is equal in effect to the damage caused by a hit from a missile hurled
by a large catapult. See &quot;<A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD00504.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD00504.htm.php.html">Siege Damage</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> &quot; in Chapter 9, and suffer an additional -2 penalty to the die roll described
there.
<P></P>
If a <I>horn of blasting</I> is used magically more than once per day, there is a 10% cumulative chance
that it will explode and inflict 5d10 points of damage upon the person sounding
it.
<P></P>
There are no charges upon a horn, but the device is subject to stresses as
noted above, and each time it is used to magical effect there is a 2% cumulative
chance of the instrument self-destructing. In the latter case, no damage is
inflicted on the character blowing it.
