to travel without actually touching the ground. Among other things, this means
water can be crossed—passed over without effort—and movement is possible
without leaving tracks on any sort of ground. The horse is able to move at normal
speeds, and it will not tire for as long as 12 hours' continuous riding per day
when wearing these magical horseshoes.
