When cast, the<I> speak with monsters</I> spell enables the priest to converse with any type of creature that has any
form of communicative ability (including empathic, tactile, pheromonic, etc.).
That is, the monster understands, in its own language or equivalent, the intent
of what is said to it by the priest and vice versa. The creature thus spoken to
is checked by the DM to determine a reaction. All creatures of the same type
as that chosen by the priest can likewise understand if they are within range.
The priest can speak to different types of creatures during the spell duration,
but he must speak separately to each type. The spell lasts for two rounds per
caster level.
