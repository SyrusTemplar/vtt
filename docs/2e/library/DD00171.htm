Locks are available for a variety of purposes. These range from simple
padlocks suitable for securing a small chest to elaborate inset door locks for houses
and mansions. Simple locks are usually made of iron, steel, or bronze and have
a simple mechanism that opens with one key. Elaborate locks may be made of
gold, silver, or other precious metals. They may have a hidden keyhole or multiple
keys.

Inset locks are usually commissioned to fit a specific door. Padlocks may be
available for ready sale from a locksmith or sometimes a blacksmith. Single key
locks are most common; double key locks are available from perhaps 20% of
locksmiths.
