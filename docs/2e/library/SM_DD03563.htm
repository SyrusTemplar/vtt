Potions</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Among the easiest of items to make, potions range from simple healing brews to
potent mixtures capable of taming dragons or restoring a character to complete
health and sanity. Some potions are clerical potions and can only be
manufactured by priests. These include: the <I>elixir of health, potion of extra-healing, potion of fire resistance, potion
of healing, potion of sweet water</I>, and <I>potion of vitality</I>.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Level Requirements: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Both priests and wizards must be at least 9th level to create potions.
Specialists in the school of alchemy may brew potions at 6th level, but must use
special procedures to do so. They may use the standard procedure after reaching 9th
level or continue to use their special process.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Facilities: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Wizards require an alchemical laboratory or a forge to brew potions; priests
must have a consecrated altar. (See <A HREF="PHB_DD01522.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01522.htm">Chapter 5</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> .) A wizard may need to expand his library in order to obtain the texts and
tomes needed for researching the potion-s formula.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Research: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Before a character can brew a potion, he must discover what processes,
materials, and special ingredients are required, and how these must be combined for
success. This research requires 1d3+1 weeks at a cost of 100 gp per week, but if
the character uses a <I>commune </I>or <I>contact other plane </I>spell to speed his research, he automatically succeeds in the minimum time.
<P></P>
If the character has a full dose of the potion in question to use as a sample,
the research takes only one week and costs nothing. However, he still must
have access to a laboratory or an altar in order to conduct the research.
<P></P>
Alchemists may use the research rules above once they reach 9th level, but
before that they must follow a lengthier and more expensive process if they take
advantage of their ability to create potions before other wizards can. An
alchemist of less than 9th level must spend two weeks and 500 gp per potion level to
research the formula and then pass a learn spells check. (A potion-s equivalent
spell level is its experience point value divided by 100, rounded up.)
<P></P>
Once a character has researched a potion-s formula, he need not research it
again; he can create samples of the potion as often as he wishes, as long as he
follows the cost and time requirements.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Processes and Materials: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Potions that contain only a single-use require one rare material and one
common process; potions that provide several doses with one brewing require an
exotic material and a rare process. (See <A HREF="DD03562.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03562.htm">Special Ingredients</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>at the end of this chapter.) Potions that normally produce more than one dose
include <I>potion of diminution, elixir of health, potion of extra-healing, potion of
fire breath, potion of fire resistance, potion of growth, potion of invisibility,
oil of impact, </I>and <I>potion of rainbow hues</I>.
<P></P>
One of the advantages of the alchemist is that he need not obtain special
ingredients before creating a potion; his knowledge of chemicals and reagents
enables him to simulate these rare materials, whether he is using the alchemical
process or the magical process.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cost and Time: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Assuming that the character is able to obtain any special or unusual materials
required for the potion, it will cost him a number of gold pieces equal to the
potion-s experience point value to brew the potion. This process takes one day
per 100 gp required.
<P></P>
The alchemical process usually requires one full week and 300 to 1,800 gp
(3d6x100) to brew a potion. If the potion-s experience point value is greater than
700, then the alchemist must spend an extra day per 100 experience points
brewing the potion. However, at 9th level, the alchemist may choose to use the
normal potion-brewing rules instead.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Success or Failure: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The base chance for a successful brewing is 70%, +2% per character level, ?1%
for every 100 gp the potion costs. For example, a 13th-level wizard brewing a <I>potion of fire breath </I>would have a success chance of 96% (70% + 26% for character level), less 4%
(400 gp), for a total of 92%. The DM should make this check in secret, since on a
natural roll of 96 or higher the process fails, and the potion is cursed in
some way (typically, it becomes a potion of poison or delusion instead of what it
should be).
<P></P>
Alchemists may instead use a learn spells check, with a +1% bonus per
character level, to see if they are successful in brewing the potion. Or, if the
alchemist is 9th level or higher, he may produce the potion by magical means, using
the normal success check of 70% + 2% per level. If this is the case, the
alchemist gains a +5% to his success chance due to his specialist knowledge of potions.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Talghaz the Enchanter, a 9th-level wizard, decides that he needs to produce a </I>philter of love <I>in order to help a princess fall in love with one of his comrades. Talghaz
already possesses a minimal library and arranges to borrow the laboratory of his
alchemist friend. As a result, he can begin his research without any additional
expense. He uses no special techniques, so the research takes 1d3+1 weeks and
costs him 100 gp per week.
<P></P>
After three weeks, Talghaz finishes his research. He discovers that the potion
requires the tears of a dryad as a rare material and, with some grumbling,
sets out to find a dryad and convince her to shed a few tears for him. One week
(and an interesting adventure) later, Talghaz returns to the laboratory with a
vial full of dryad tears and sets about brewing his potion. A </I>philter of love <I>is worth 200 XP, so it takes Talghaz two days and 200 gp to brew the potion.
<P></P>
When Talghaz finishes, the DM checks in secret to see if he was successful.
The base chance is 70%, plus 18% for Talghaz-s level, less 2% for the potion-s
experience point value. The DM also decides that a philter of love is right up an
enchanter-s alley and gives Talghaz the +5% bonus for specialization. His
total chance of success is 91%; if the DM rolls a 96 or higher, the failure creates
a cursed potion. (Wouldn-t that be a surprise for Talghaz-s friend?)
