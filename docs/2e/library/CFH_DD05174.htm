In this type of campaign, most or all of the player-characters have the same
Warrior Kit. They don't all have to be of an identical class: In a Swashbucklers
campaign, one character could be a Fighter/Swashbuckler, another a
Ranger/Swashbuckler, and another a Paladin/Swashbuckler.
<P></P>
The DM may require that all characters in such a campaign be Warriors, or may
allow a mix of character classes appropriate to the campaign's subject . . .
but the majority of characters must still be Warriors, and other classes can be
represented only by one player-character. For example, in a campaign based on
the legends of Robin Hood, most of the characters will be Warriors with the
Pirate/Outlaw kit; the DM could permit just one or a few to be Thieves; there's only
one Priest (Friar Tuck) and only one Bard (Allen a'Dale).
<P></P>
The purposes of this campaign (other than the normal Having Fun and Going on
Adventures, of course) are to showcase the lives of characters with this Warrior
Kit, and to pursue the goals common to characters who share this Warrior Kit.
So, below, you'll find descriptions of campaigns centered around all the
specific Warrior Kits and their specific goals.
