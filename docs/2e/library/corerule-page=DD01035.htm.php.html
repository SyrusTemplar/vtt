<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Robe of Stars:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This rather ordinary-appearing garment seems typical of apparel worn by a
wizard. However, it will radiate a strong aura of alteration and evocation if
examined for magic. The robe enables its wearer to travel physically on the Astral
Plane, along with all that he is wearing or carrying. The garment also enables
the wearer to survive comfortably in the void of outer space. In other
situations, the robe gives its wearer a +1 bonus to all saving throws.
<P></P>
The robe is embroidered with stars, and the wearer can use up to six of these
as missile weapons, provided he is proficient with darts as a weapon. Each star
is a throwing weapon of +5 value, both to hit and damage. Maximum range is 60
feet and base damage is 2d4 points per hit. The special star weapons are
located on the chest portion of the robe. If the wearer does not use all of these
missiles, they will replace themselves magically at the rate of one per day. If
all six are used, all of the robe's traveling and missile powers are gone forever.
