This spell confronts those affected by it with phantasmal images of their most
feared enemies, forcing an imaginary combat that seems real, but actually
occurs in the blink of an eye. When this spell is cast, the wizard must be able to
converse with the victims to bring the spell into being. During the casting,
the wizard must call out to the creatures to be affected, informing one or all
that their final fate, indeed their doom, is now upon them.
<P></P>
The force of the magic is such that even if the creatures make their saving
throws vs. spell, fear will paralyze them for a full round, and they will lose
1d4 Strength points from this fear (the lost Strength will return in one turn).
Failure to save vs. spell causes the creature or creatures to face their
nemeses, the opponents most feared and inimical to them. Actual combat must then take
place, for no magical means of escape is possible. The foe fought is real for
all intents and purposes; affected creatures that lose will die. If a creature's
phantasmal nemesis from the <I>weird</I> spell is slain, the creature emerges with no damage, no loss of items
seemingly used in the combat, and no loss of spells likewise seemingly expended. The
creature also gains any experience for defeating the weird, if applicable.
<P></P>
Although each round of combat seems normal, it takes only one-tenth of a
round. During the course of the spell, the caster must concentrate fully upon
maintaining it. If the combat goes beyond 10 rounds, those who saved against the
spell can take action. If the caster is disturbed, the <I>weird</I> spell ends immediately. Creatures attacked while paralyzed with fear are free
of the paralysis immediately.
