A helpful way for a wizard to analyze his arsenal is by assigning his spells
to various categories. The following system uses six categories based on a
spell's use in combat situations. The categories include:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Defensive 1.</B> This category of spells provides protection from harm. It includes spells
that make the subject more difficult to hit, increase his resistance to damage,
and shield him from various types of opponents. Usually, a wizard casts this type
of spell on himself or on his allies.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Defensive 2.</B> This category of spells hinders an opponent's ability to attack without
directly causing damage to the opponent. It includes various <I>charm, hold</I>, and blinding spells, along with spells that add penalties to an opponent's
attack rolls. Usually, a wizard casts this type of spell directly on one or more
of his opponents.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Offensive 1.</B> This category of spells increases the chance to inflict damage on an
opponent. It includes spells that give bonuses to attack and damage rolls, as well as
those that increase strength. It does not include spells that directly inflict
damage. Usually, a wizard casts this type of spell on himself or his allies.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Offensive 2.</B> This category of spells directly inflicts damage on opponents. It includes
spells that cause an opponent to lose hit points, such as <I>chill touch</I> and <I>lightning bolt</I>, spells that cause creatures to lose levels of ability, such as <I>energy drain</I>, and spells that cause damage to specific creatures, such as <I>transmute water to dust</I>. Usually, a wizard casts this type of spell on one or more of his opponents,
although exceptions include spells that create or summon entities to fight on
the caster's behalf, such as <I>monster summoning</I>.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Reconnaissance.</B> This category reveals information about opponents or provides warnings about
their actions.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Special.</B> This catch-all category includes spells that have no specific offensive,
defensive, or reconnaissance use in combat.
<P></P>
<P></P>
How do you decide which spells belong to which categories? It is not an exact
science, but rather a generalization based on a spell's most common use in
combat situations. For instance, <I>fireball</I> can be used to destroy inanimate objects, but in combat situations, it is
usually used to inflict damage on an opponent; therefore, it is an Offensive spell
-- Offensive 2, to be exact. <I>Light</I> is helpful for finding the way in a dark cavern, but in combat, it can be
used to blind opponents to reduce their attack rolls, making it a Defensive
spell-- more precisely, a Defensive 2 spell. (For quick reference, it may be helpful
to note each spell's category next to its name on the character sheet.)
<P></P>
If a spell seems to fit into more than one category, that is to be expected.
Remember, the point is not to draw rigid boundaries, but to learn to think in
terms of a spell's function as opposed to its level or flashy name. As an
illustration, here are categorizations of some 1st- and 2nd-level spells from the <I>Player's Handbook</I>.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Defensive 1:</B> <I>Protection from evil, armor, shield, mirror image, invisibilty, blur
<P></P>
<P></P>
</I> <B>Defensive 2:</B> <I>Color spray, enlarge, light, grease, shocking grasp, taunt, wall of fog,
deafness</I>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Offensive 1:</B> <I>Spectral hand, strength</I>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Offensive 2: </B><I>Burning hands, shocking grasp, chill touch, flaming sphere, stinking cloud</I>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Reconnaissance:</B> <I>Alarm, comprehend languages, message, detect undead, ESP
<P></P>
<P></P>
</I> <B>Special:</B> <I>Dancing lights, erase, hold portal, jump, mending, spider climb, wizard mark</I>
<P></P>
<P></P>
The various categories are discussed in detail in the following sections.
Players should use the information to help them assign their spells to categories,
which in turn will enable them to choose the best spells for their wizards to
memorize in a particular situation
