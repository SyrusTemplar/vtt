Overbearing includes most attacks aimed at simply overpowering the target. If
the attackers are seeking to overwhelm the defender through brute strength or
sheer weight of numbers, it’s an overbearing attack. Overbearing is a tactic
available to any creature and can be used against almost any other creature.
Creatures with multiple legs are difficult to overbear. Creatures with no legs at all
are nearly impossible to overbear (because they can’t be knocked down) but
attackers with sufficient strength sometimes can pin them in place. Creatures with
no solid form (immaterial, gaseous, or liquid) cannot be overborne.
