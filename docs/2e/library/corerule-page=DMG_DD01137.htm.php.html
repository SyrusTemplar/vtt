Tables 113 through 119 should be used to determine the properties of an
intelligent weapon: the number of powers, unusual properties, alignment, and special
purpose of the item (if any). Such weapons are useful to give higher-level
fighters some additional tactical options and limited-use special abilities.

The DM is encouraged to design unusual magical weapons along special themes
and for specific campaign purposes, using the tables as guidelines and for
inspiration. Just because a power is rolled doesn't mean it must be given out. If the
DM feels a combination is too bizarre or powerful, he can simply change or
ignore it.
