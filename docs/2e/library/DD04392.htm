By casting an <I>abundance</I> spell, the priest quickens the ripening of a harvest or the growth of
woodland. Fields of crops in the affected area will grow, ripen, and be ready for
harvest in a single day. Seed must be sown any time before the casting of the spell.
<P></P>
An area of woodland will grow as if it had grown for 25 years in one day plus
five years per day for another three days. There must be soil capable of
supporting the woodland for the growth to remain healthy.
<P></P>
The priest must stand anywhere within the area to be affected. The priest
designates the exact size and shape of the area in the casting.
<P></P>
The area of effect is 10 square miles for ripening a harvest and 25 square
miles for woodland growth. This spell does not create effects such as entanglement
or enlargement of the flora within the area of effect.
