In addition to the usual spell characteristics (range, components, duration,
casting time, area of effect, and saving throw), several additional
characteristics are included in these new spells. These refer to material discussed in <A HREF="DD03570.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03570.htm">Chapter 8</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> and include the following items:
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Casting Subtlety: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This describes how easily the spell may be cast without the caster?s action
being spotted for what it is. The number given is the base modifier to an
observer?s Intelligence check based on the physical components and casting time of the
spell. However, the DM may apply situational modifiers as he deems appropriate.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sensory Signature: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Spells possess sensory signatures ranging from small to gargantuan describing
how spectacular and noticeable the spell?s effects are.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Knockdown: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">If the spell causes a knockdown chance when it strikes a creature, the
knockdown die is noted here.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Critical Strikes: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">If the spell is capable of causing a critical strike check, the spell?s size,
number of locations hit, and the type of damage is noted here. For example, <I>lightning bolt </I>would be noted as large (1d3 hits), electricity. Huge creatures treat spells
as if they were one size smaller, and gargantuan creatures treat spells as if
they were two sizes smaller.
<P></P>
If you are not using any of these optional spell characteristics in your
campaign, simply ignore the information; the basic spell description can be used for
play in most campaigns.
