When I first began playing the AD&amp;D® game (more years ago than I care to
remember), the system seemed to offer rules for every conceivable
eventuality—indeed, the books contained more systems and procedures than any player or DM could
possibly need.
<P></P>
It didn’t take long to disabuse myself of that notion. As I recall, it was the
first time the players asked me, the DM, if their characters could swim. How
well? How fast, and for how long? And if their characters couldn’t swim, could
they float for awhile? And how many gold pieces could you carry before you sank
like a stone?
<P></P>
Many of those questions have been subsequently answered in accessories and,
most significantly, in the AD&amp;D 2nd Edition game rules. However, for every
situation defined by rules, and every new procedure introduced to the game, more
questions were asked by creative (dare I say ‘devious’?) players, and more systems
were improvised by every DM.
<P></P>
It would nice the say that the<I> Player’s Option™: Skills &amp; Powers</I> system will put all that to rest—but we’d all recognize that as an
exaggeration, to say the least. Nor would that be a realistic objective. Part of
adventure gaming is the discovery of the unknown and the unexpected, and we’ll always
need a referee to oversee this.
<P></P>
However, I believe that this book adds a lot to the game, and I hope you will
agree that it does so without increasing the game’s complexity. The word
‘option’ is in the title for a very good reason: We have attempted to add to the
number of <B>choices</B> available to players and DMs alike, without adding to the complications of
resolving these choices.
<P></P>
I sincerely hope that you’ll decide that we have succeeded.

All things in nature must evolve in order to keep pace with their
surroundings. Organisms must adapt as their environment changes if they wish to thrive.
This also is true in gaming. The AD&amp;D game is one of the oldest role-playing rules
systems around. And it’s a great system; its longevity is proof enough of
that. But in the time that the AD&amp;D game has existed, gaming itself has evolved,
and so has the game. The original AD&amp;D game evolved from the D&amp;D game in the late
1970s. Then, in the early ‘80s, the Unearthed Arcana book, the first major
evolution of the AD&amp;D game, was published. More evolutions followed, culminating
in 1989 with the publication of the AD&amp;D 2nd Edition game rules. Now, the <I>Player’s Option</I> books (and the DM™ <I>Option: High-level Handbook</I> to be published later this year) represent the latest evolutions of the AD&amp;D
game.
<P></P>
The central concept behind the <I>Player’s Option</I> books is <B>player choice</B>. We wanted to expand the AD&amp;D game in ways that had never been explored
before. We hoped to offer the players and DMs of the AD&amp;D game more options (there’s
that word again) than they ever had. We wanted to give those who play the AD&amp;D
game more choices, more control over their game and their characters than was
previously considered possible. We hope we’ve succeeded, but in truth, that
decision is not in our hands. You, the DMs and players of the game will have the
final say in this matter.
<P></P>
We hope you use these rules in your games. We also hope you’ll give us your
feedback on these rules and the AD&amp;D games you play using them, thus insuring
that the game will continue to evolve.
<P></P>
Me, I’m just happy to have had an impact on the game that has influenced my
life for so many years.
