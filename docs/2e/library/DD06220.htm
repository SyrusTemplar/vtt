The most important element in determining an illusion's believability is its
complexity. The more complex the illusion, the more difficult it is for the
caster to get all the details right, and the more likely it is for a subject to
notice a mistake. There are more details to a fire-breathing dragon than there are
to a stationary boulder, so it is no surprise that a subject would be more
likely to disbelieve the illusionary dragon than he would the illusionary rock.
<P></P>
An illusion can be a re-creation of a non-living (inanimate) or a living
(animate) object. These need to be treated in different ways.
<P></P>
In general, the complexity of non-living objects depends on size (a pebble vs.
a boulder), number (a single boulder vs. a dozen boulders scattered over an
area), and appearance (a smooth gray boulder vs. a sparkling, multi-colored gem).
External forces affecting the object also affect its complexity (wind blowing
pebbles along the ground or an avalanche of boulders tumbling down a hill).
<P></P>
If the illusion has an excessive number of sensory elements, the subject's
saving throw may receive a positive modifier. What constitutes an excessive number
of elements? A single color or texture (for instance, a smooth gray boulder)
is not excessive. Multiple colors and textures (a pile of various types of gems
or minerals) or several different sensory elements (a field of variously
colored flowers that have a variety of fragrances) could be considered excessive, as
could the illusion of motion, such as boulders tumbling down a hill.
<P></P>
These factors are not necessarily cumulative; in fact, only in the most
exceptional cases would an illusion of non-living objects result in a saving throw
modifier of more than +2.
<P></P>
Examples:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> An illusion of a single blue diamond. Saving throw modifier: 0. Nothing about
this illusion is particularly difficult since it is a single, stationary item.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> An illusion of ten thousand sparkling blue diamonds tumbling in an avalanche
down a hillside. Saving throw: +2. There are a large number of items, they're
sparkling, and they're in motion. The comparatively high saving throw bonus is
also justified by the extremely unusual effect--a character might accept an
avalanche of boulders, but an avalanche of diamonds is likely to arouse suspicion.
