hippopotami. Their legs are cylindrical and stocky, with a heavy torso and
clumsy but strong thick-fingered hands. Their faces are very hippopotamus-like, with
small eyes and ears, and their skulls are exceedingly dense and strong. Giff
are not known as towering intellectuals, but they are immensely strong and loyal
to their employers.

The life of soldiering has become the only occupation in giff society, and
bands of giff hire out their services to all causes. Therefore, a giff considers
it his only purpose in life to keep himself fit, strong, and ready for action.
They are fascinated by weapons (the more complicated, the better) and the
trappings of military life, such as regimental histories, parades, and other forms of
spit and polish.
