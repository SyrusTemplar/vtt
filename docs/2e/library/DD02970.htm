<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Kits</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> There are a few rules for players to follow when selecting character kits.
<P></P>
A player may not choose a kit that is barred to his character’s class or race.
In the case of multi-classed characters, if the kit is barred to any of the
character’s classes, he may not select that kit.
<P></P>
A player can have only one kit per character, and the selection must be made
during character creation. The only exception is if these rules are added to an
already existing AD&amp;D game campaign. In this case, the DM and players can agree
on an appropriate kit for each character.
<P></P>
Once a kit is chosen, the player cannot later change it. For example, if a
character has the peasant hero kit, and over the course of a long, successful
campaign he becomes the ruler of his homeland, he does not now assume the noble
kit. He remains a peasant hero. Characters cannot change their pasts.
<P></P>
Remember, a character with a kit can purchase any of the recommended weapon
and nonweapon proficiencies (but not recommended traits) listed for 1 character
point less than the cost detailed in the <A HREF="DD03011.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03011.htm">proficiency section</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
In general, any of the following kits can be used with any character class.
Some combinations, such as paladin/thug are not allowed. Let common sense, the
campaign setting, and the DM serve as guides. These kits also can apply to the
NPCs inhabiting a DM’s campaign. If a player wants to randomly select a kit, he
can use <A HREF="DD02969.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02969.htm">Table 41</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. The table also can be used to generate NPCs.
