<I> Description:</I> The Spy is a gatherer of information. At the lowest level, he is a common
informant, an eavesdropper with his ears open for salable information. The expert
Spy is hired by guilds and governments to infiltrate opponents' buildings and
ranks to find vital, secret knowledge.
<P></P>
To take the Spy kit, a thief must have a minimum Intelligence of 11.
<P></P>
<I>Role:</I> Spies are vital in supporting any large organization such as a guild or
government. Information is the key to success, whether thieves are preparing for a
burglary or a nation is preparing for war, and the Spy's role is to provide that
information.
<P></P>
Most Spies are in the permanent service of one such organization. A small
number may be double (or triple) agents, but that is very risky. A few are
freelance, and their main problem is this: to find employment, they must be known; but
if they're known, they have difficulty being successful.
<P></P>
Spies may come from any background. A large percentage, in fact, are from the
lower classes, close in touch with the word on the street and all the secret
channels of society. A smaller number of elite Spies exist, either in permanent
positions (e.g., a count who reports word on his liege's troop movements to a
rival kingdom, or a treacherous castle steward). Most of these characters would
not be of the Spy rogue kit, since spying is secondary; the focus of their life
is (or at least was) something else.
<P></P>
But there are also talented individuals ready to go anywhere, risk any danger,
and encounter a lot of excitement on the way to finding the knowledge they
seek. They excel at infiltration, in finding information, not just in selling what
they know. Exciting Spies, and player characters, are usually of this sort.
<P></P>
The standard penalty for spying (if the crime is beyond the low levels of
spreading rumors, eavesdropping, and scoping out potential burglary targets) is
death, and Spies from one nation to another can hardly expect anything in the line
of &quot;diplomatic immunity.&quot;
<P></P>
<I>Secondary Skills:</I> Any.
<P></P>
<I> Weapon Proficiencies: </I>The normal range of weapons open for thieves' proficiencies applies to Spies
as well, and they are not required to take any in particular. A Spy can use
nonthief weapons (for the purpose of disguises), but cannot take proficiency in
them.
<P></P>
<I>Example:</I> To help impersonate a castle guard, a Spy carries a halberd. He could use it
combat, but he would suffer a nonproficiency penalty. To increase his chances
of success, he would probably switch to a different, familiar weapon-even a
dagger or knife-unless circumstances prohibit it (e.g., people around him would be
surprised to see him not using the halberd, and might thereby see through the
disguise).
<P></P>
<I> Nonweapon Proficiencies:</I> Required: Disguise, Gather Intelligence, Observation. Recommended: Alertness,
Begging, Etiquette, Forgery, Heraldry, Local History, Reading/Writing, Reading
Lips, Trailing.
<P></P>
<I>Skill Progression: </I>An effective Spy usually needs a fairly even distribution of thief skills,
since his vocation can bring him into any number of diverse situations.
<P></P>
<I>Equipment:</I> Spies in the medieval setting don't have all the fancy gadgetry of their
modern counterparts. They may equip themselves liberally with what is available,
however, such as boots with hidden compartments in the soles, thieves' equipment,
and so forth. See the later chapter on equipment for a host of ideas.
<P></P>
<I> Special Benefits:</I> None.
<P></P>
<I>Special Hindrances:</I> None.
<P></P>
<I>Races:</I> Elves and half-elves, with their love for knowledge, are especially
predisposed toward this kit. However, the problem that all demihuman Spies face is the
difficulty of appearing disguised as a member of another race. They therefore
risk having a rather limited range of professional assignments.
