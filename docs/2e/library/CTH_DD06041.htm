<I>Terrak, the Master, looked through the hazy air of the hideout. The acrid
scent of charcoal smoke mingled with the sweat dripping freely from his assembled
thieves. Indeed, the air in the attic remained always fetid, for even on a cool
night such as this they dared not open any passage to the outside. So
precarious was their position in the city, so firm was the Black Duke's grip on the
populace, that any hint of their presence here would bring swift and brutal
reprisal.
<P></P>
For the hundredth time, Terrak examined the members of his small band. They
were brave men and women, and he trusted them all. They were bound to him not by
any bonds of love—though he knew they respected him—but instead by a common,
flaming hatred. He wondered, again, if such a ragged assemblage could actually be
a threat to one as mighty as the Duke. But then he sighed, knowing they had no
choice.
<P></P>
Straight across from him, Terrak saw Ardina, the weaver. The old woman
practiced her trade skillfully during the day, and none suspected that her bottles of
dye, or her carefully wrapped bundles of cloth, were used to smuggle the gains
of the band around the city, and even to locations beyond the high wall. Even
now the band gathered in the attic of her shop, since she had risked her cover
and her life to provide them this temporary hideout.
<P></P>
Wistfully, Terrak remembered the guildhall, built with the profits of his long
labors, and even the sweat of his own brow. The building had contained secret
passages, hidden compartments, deadly traps, and easily defensible combat
stations. But it had all gone up in smoke when the Black Duke's enforcers had
attacked. Terrak's eyes misted as he thought of Serana, his beautiful, young Serana,
calling to him with her last words before the flames had taken her, had taken
so many of them.
<P></P>
But the Master Thief hardened his mind and his plans. Indeed, it had been
those same precautions, the secret doors and the hidden compartments, that had
allowed this small remnant of his band to escape. Now they gathered here, dry
kindling awaiting the spark that would ignite the flames of their revenge.
<P></P>
Terrak turned to an old man beside him. &quot;And so, Rorden, the Duke's treasury
awaits us now?&quot;
<P></P>
The man nodded his balding head. Terrak reminded himself that the man was not
as old as he looked. The Duke, however, had seized Rorden's wife for use as a
concubine many years earlier. By threatening her with death, the ruler had
forced the talented Rorden to keep his books and provide him with information. Now,
the Duke's threat to claim the man's daughter for a similar fate had finally
driven Rorden to fight against his brutal lord.
<P></P>
&quot;Indeed, Master.&quot; Rorden spread a piece of parchment on the floor. &quot;You see
here the layout of the Duke's mansion. I have marked the secret passage to the
vault, though I could not gain the key to the lock. I am sorry, but the Duke
keeps it on a key around his neck.&quot;
<P></P>
Terrak waved away the man's apology. Once they found the lock, he knew Xeno
could open it. Indeed, the lockpicker even now instinctively flexed his fingers
and licked his lips. Xeno, too, had lost his woman in the Duke's raid. Terrak
knew he would perform with skill on this night.
<P></P>
&quot;And the painting?&quot; asked Terrak, carefully watching the other members of his
band. He saw Rocko flex unconsciously, grasping the stump of his right arm with
his left hand. Rocko had lost his hand as a mere boy, when the Duke's watchmen
had caught him stealing bacon in the marketplace. Rocko was brave, but not
terribly bright. He, of all of them, had expressed the most misgivings about the
plan to steal the piece of art along with the Duke's treasury of gems.
<P></P>
&quot;Remember, the Duke is ruled by his vanity above all else,&quot; Terrak reminded
them, directing his measured stare at the unflinching Rocko. &quot;That painting of
himself, the work he paid thousands of gold pieces for that it may hang in his
great hall, serves as a symbol of his vanity. It has left a bitter taste in the
mouths of the entire city. Its theft will put a large dent in the Duke's armor
of rulership!&quot; (At least, I hope it will!), Terrak concluded silently.
<P></P>
&quot;Now, the challenges,&quot; the Master Thief continued. He looked at Kyrin, to his
left.
<P></P>
&quot;I will have the wagon ready,&quot; the girl answered solemnly. She had been just
old enough to understand her loss when her parents had died in the inferno of
the guildhouse. Terrak knew that she spoke the truth.
<P></P>
&quot;Here are the magic mouths.&quot; Terrak gestured at the parchment as Rorden nodded.
<P></P>
&quot;My spell of silence will be ready,&quot; nodded another thief, a thin and wiry man
of indeterminate age. Only the golden sheen of his blond hair suggested his
true race. The half-elf was a skilled thief, but at times his talents as a
magic-user were even more valuable to the band.
<P></P>
&quot;These walls are oiled to prevent scaling,&quot; explained Rorden, gesturing around
the periphery of the courtyard.
<P></P>
A snicker came from a young woman across the room, and Terrak allowed himself
a slight smile of his own. The Black Duke would need more than slippery walls
to stop Bria the acrobat and her grappling hook. &quot;Just remember to drop a rope
for the rest of us,&quot; reminded the Master.
<P></P>
&quot;And finally, the guards,'' pointed Rorden. &quot;They are commanded by Puroch,
whose loyalty the Duke extorts by holding his family at knifepoint.''
<P></P>
&quot;The family is now safe in hiding?&quot; asked Terrak, looking at the old
weaverwoman.
<P></P>
She nodded with a toothless grin. &quot;Puroch will join us now.&quot;
<P></P>
Terrak looked again at his small, capable band. He knew them all, understood
their strengths and their weaknesses. He would not betray them, and he knew they
would not betray him.
<P></P>
&quot;We cannot hope that the theft of a painting and a few gems will bring the
power of this duke crashing down,&quot; he said softly. &quot;But if, by this theft, we can
force the entire city to see him for the madman he is—and his madness will be
plain to all when he discovers the defaced painting hanging above the outer gate
of his mansion!—we can do him great harm.&quot;
<P></P>
&quot;And too, we can pave the road to our return. Soon, my loyal comrades, we will
become the influential guild that we were once before!&quot;
<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
The thief campaign resembles any other AD&amp;D® game campaign in many respects:
There must be a challenge for the PCs to face, the challenge must be balanced to
the strength of the characters, and the rewards must be enjoyable enough to
keep everyone having a good time—but not so abundant as to drastically inflate
the finances of your campaign world.
<P></P>
But it is in the specifics of play that some of these campaign aspects can
take on unique and entertaining features when applied to a campaign involving many
thief characters.
<P></P>
This section explores some of these features, providing detail to DMs and also
players.
