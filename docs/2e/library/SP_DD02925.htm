themselves into swans. In human form, they are indistinguishable from other people,
although they-re frequently women of striking looks and grace. In swan form, they
are great white birds of extraordinary beauty. All swanmays carry a magical
token of some kind-a ring, cloak, or belt, for instance-that allows them to change
shape.

Swanmays belong to a special sisterhood of druids and rangers, living in
communal lodges in hidden forests. Their homes are always near silent lakes or
marshes. They oppose poachers, raiders, and others who disturb the natural order of
the land, and they act as friends and protectors of the forest folk. Many
swanmays give up routine adventuring to guard their homes against the forces of
evil, but a few-player character swanmays-wander the land to fight evil wherever
they find it.
