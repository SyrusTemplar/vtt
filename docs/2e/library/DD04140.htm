Priests and clerics are the servants of Powers--immortal entities with
abilities far beyond those of mere mortals. Yet these servants do not wield magical
forces equal to those of wizards; priests have nothing to compare with the wish
spell, for example. Circumstances will arise when a priest should be able to
call upon the magical energies controlled by his Power to achieve something
extraordinary in serving a sacred duty. Quest spells are designed to satisfy these
extremes and allow the priest to wield high-powered magic without drastically
altering the scope of his magic.
<P></P>
Quest spells are a category of powerful spells without an assigned level. They
should not be confused with the 5th-level spell quest, which is a specific
single spell.
<P></P>
While quest spells are powerful, they are not as powerful as the energies used
by Powers. If a god chose to flatten a mountain or raise an island, he could
probably do so. Priests cannot achieve such huge effects; they are still mortal
beings. But quest spells do provide a priest with magic more powerful than any
other priestly magic; a quest spell could easily mean the difference between
success or failure in a mission. Quest spells are capable of affecting large
areas or numbers of creatures and allow the shaping of great energies; they are
often difficult or impossible to resist or dispel.
<P></P>
Quest spells are not part of a priest's normal repertoire. These spells are
granted powers, bestowed directly by one's deity to achieve special goals.
