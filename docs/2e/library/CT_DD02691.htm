</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Attackers who have made successful overbearing attacks have an advantage over
the defender in the following round. The attackers can release the opponent or
try for a pin.
<P></P>
If the attackers release the opponent, they can immediately attempt another
unarmed attack, draw a weapon and attack (this counts as a half-move action), or
attempt some other action normally available to characters, such as movement.
<P></P>
If the attackers try for a pin, conduct another opposed Strength roll. If the
attackers win, the opponent is pinned (<A HREF="DD02691.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02691.htm">see below</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). If the defender wins, the attackers must leave the defenderâ€™s square and
the defender can spend a half move or an attack to stand up, just as if she had
suffered a knockdown.
