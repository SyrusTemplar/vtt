Every item that is to be imbued with magic must be of the finest quality,
specifically created for the purpose of placing enchantments upon it. An item must
be created from one or more special materials, each of which must undergo a
certain number of special processes. A character creating a sword, for example,
must first commission a rare and unusual blade to be crafted. A regular sword
from the local smithy cannot become a <I>sword +3 frost brand</I>. Creating a magical item is not a matter of picking up a few household
articles and muttering an incantation.

<A HREF="DD01289.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01289.htm">Table 23</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> lists the materials and processes various types of items require. Some of
these are more difficult to complete or acquire than others, as explained in the
notes to the table. Table 23 gives the suggested number of materials and
processes each item requires as well as a few suggestions. It is up to the DM to
decide exactly what materials and processes are necessary; this requires a great
deal of creativity on the DM's part. In any case, the character does not
automatically know what the requirements are.

Gathering all the necessary materials can take a lot of time. Ideally, the DM
should create a series of adventures that allows the character to obtain
everything. The character is free to get help from any other character who can be
persuaded to join the hunt.
