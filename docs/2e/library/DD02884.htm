<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Subability Checks</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Subabilities are more specific definitions of a character’s aptitudes. They
can be used more often to determine the success of actions beyond simple
proficiency checks. The concept of ability checks was introduced in the <A HREF="PHB_DD01727.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="PHB_DD01727.htm">Player’s Handbook</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">. This concept is expanded with subabilities. Specific examples of the various
subability checks follow. The lists are not intended to be all-encompassing,
but simply guidelines of the uses of subability checks.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Stamina:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> This subability is used to ascertain a character’s physical exertion over a
period of time. Sample opportunities to call for Stamina checks include a
character holding a heavy weight or propping up a collapsing ceiling. When a
character is in pursuit of an NPC or monster that has the same movement rate, the
Stamina check determines who will tire first. Other checks could involve long-term
physical exertion such as swimming vast distances, defending the castle walls
from attackers over the course of hours or days, or staying awake long enough to
memorize spells for the next day—after a long day of adventuring.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Muscle:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Times to call for Muscle checks include when characters try to pick up heavy
objects, leap chasms, arm wrestle, and display feats of strength.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Aim:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Potential times to use Aim checks include when characters enter games of
skill, such as darts; when they try sleight-of-hand maneuvers; and when they try to
catch things thrown at them, such as balls, coins, or books.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Balance:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Balance checks can be called for when a character walks along a narrow ledge
to reach a window, when he flees across a rope bridge while trying to avoid
attackers’ missile weapons, and when he catches a handhold after an enemy damages
that rope bridge and causes it to collapse.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Health:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Health checks can be used to determine a character’s resistance to a disease,
and to find out if a character catches the flu going around the kingdom. They
also determine a character’s resistance to intoxicants, drugs, or poisons.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fitness:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Fitness checks can be used to gauge an adventurer’s resistance to longer-term
hardships such as forced marches, food or water deprivation, and non-lethal
torture.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Reason:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Good times to call for Reason checks include when a character is searching
for clues at the scene of a crime, when someone is trying to learn new
information, or when a character is attempting to read a code or decipher a cryptic
message.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Knowledge:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Knowledge checks can be used when characters try to understand a strange
language or recall bits of information they have seemingly forgotten.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Intuition:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> These checks are called for when adventurers think they are being followed,
that their NPC friend is acting strangely, or when someone attempts to con them.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Willpower:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Willpower checks are needed when a character’s force of will is challenged,
such as when he is offered a bribe, is interrogated, or is blackmailed. Other
possibilities include when a character tries to persuade an NPC about an
important issue or point, or when a character is tortured to surrender valuable
information.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Leadership:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Situations calling for Leadership checks include when an adventurer leads
NPCs into battle, when one adventurer asks a favor of another, or when a character
attempts to instill a belief or attitude into a crowd or mob.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Appearance:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Appearance checks can be used in social circumstances where the involved
character has no established reputation. Or the checks might determine if an NPC
becomes romantically interested in the character.
