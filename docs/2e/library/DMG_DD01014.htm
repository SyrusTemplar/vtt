<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Periapt of Foul Rotting:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This engraved gem appears to be a gem of small value. If any character claims
it as his own, he will contract a terrible rotting disease which can be removed
only by application of a <I>remove curse</I> spell followed by a <I>cure disease</I> and then a <I>heal, limited wish</I>, or <I>wish</I> spell. The rotting can also be countered by crushing a <I>periapt of health</I> and sprinkling its dust upon the afflicted character. Otherwise, the
afflicted loses one point each of Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma per week
beginning one week after claiming the item. When any score reaches 0, the character
is dead. Each point lost due to the disease will be permanent regardless of
subsequent removal of the affliction.
