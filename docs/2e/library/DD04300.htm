This spell allows the priest to determine the &quot;tenor of the now&quot;--in other
words, to learn the &quot;force&quot; that is most dominant at the time. To cast the spell,
the priest generates a series of random numbers and then studies the pattern
contained in that string of numbers. This pattern contains information about
current conditions.
<P></P>
In game terms, when this spell is cast, the DM communicates to the priest's
player a single word or short phrase (no more than five words) describing the
&quot;tone&quot; of the situation. Examples of suitable &quot;tones&quot; are &quot;imminent danger&quot; (the
DM knows a dragon is approaching the area); &quot;peace and tranquility&quot; (the woods
in which the PCS camp may look threatening, but the area is actually free of
evil influence); or &quot;betrayal&quot; (one of the PCS' hirelings is actually a spy of
their enemy). The DM can make this comment cryptic, but it should always be
accurate and contain some useful information.
<P></P>
This spell has no specified area of effect. The result of <I>moment reading</I> will always concern the priest and anyone else in his immediate vicinity, but
the definition of &quot;vicinity&quot; will vary depending on the circumstances. For
example, the tenor of the moment might be &quot;severe danger&quot; if the priest is
entering the territory of a dragon who attacks interlopers on sight.
<P></P>
The tenor of the moment is always personally applicable to the priest. For
example, even if the priest is in a nation dangerously close to war with its
neighbor, this condition will not appear in the tenor of the moment unless the
priest is personally involved (if he's currently in the direct path of an invading
army, for instance).
<P></P>
One casting of this spell tends to &quot;taint&quot; subsequent castings of the same
spell unless they are separated by a minimum length of time. If a priest casts
this spell twice within 12 hours, the second reading gives the same result as the
first, regardless of the actual situation. If a second priest casts the spell
within 12 hours of another priest's use of the spell, he receives an accurate
reading.
<P></P>
The material component is a set of 36 small disks made of polished bone
engraved with runes that represent numbers. These disks are not consumed in the
casting.
