<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>Wu Jen</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Description:</B> The Wu Jen is a wizard from
cultures based on medieval oriental civilizations. He is a sorcerer
of mysterious power and uncertain fealty. Unlike the oriental
samurai, the Wu Jen seldom answers to a lord or master. His primary
allegiance is to himself and to his craft.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The Wu Jen seldom lives among the masses, preferring
instead to dwell in the wilderness where he can contemplate the
secrets of nature without interruption. Living the life of a hermit,
the Wu Jen concentrates on purifying his body and mind, thus making
him more receptive to the supernatural forces of the world.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">To be a Wu Jen, a wizard must have an Intelligence of
at least 13. He cannot be of lawful alignment, but may still be good,
evil, or neutral. The Wu Jen kit cannot be abandoned.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Preferred Schools:</B> Wu Jen prefer the schools of
conjuration/summoning, alteration, and invocation/evocation.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Barred Schools:</B> There are no barred schools for
the Wu Jen.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Role:</B> Unless the campaign has an eastern
setting, the DM, in conjunction with the player, should invent a
plausible explanation for the Wu Jen's appearance so far from home.
Perhaps the Wu Jen is on a religious pilgrimage. Perhaps a magical
device or spell transported the Wu Jen to the western world, either
intentionally or unintentionally. Or perhaps the Wu Jen is on a
decade-long quest for knowledge or self-awareness, and his travels
have brought him to the other player characters.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Whatever the reason, the Wu Jen should add a touch of
oriental intrigue and exotic culture to a western-based party. His
fellow player characters should find the Wu Jen's habits strange and
fascinating. For instance, a Wu Jen prefers to record his spells on
scrolls instead of in spell books. Perhaps he prays to the sun for an
hour each day at dawn, or maybe he eats only roots and berries. A Wu
Jen keeps his emotions hidden, and his motives are equally difficult
to discern. It is unlikely that the Wu Jen shares the party's goals
and moral code; if he agrees to join the party, it is probably due to
his intellectual curiosity.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The DM is within his rights to forbid Wu Jen from the
campaign. Before a player selects this kit, he must check with the DM
to make sure that Wu Jen are allowed.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Secondary Skills:</B> Required: Scribe.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Weapon Proficiency:</B> Required (choose one of the
following): Blowgun, short bow, dagger, dart, sling. Alternately, the
Wu Jen can choose from the selection of oriental weapons listed in
Table 9. The Wu Jen has an automatic and permanent +1 bonus to hit
whenever using the weapon he has chosen for his Weapon Proficiency.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Bonus Proficiencies:
Etiquette, Artistic Ability (Painting, Calligraphy, or Origami).
Recommended: (General) Riding (Land-based), Cooking, Dancing,
Singing; (Wizard) Astrology, Herbalism, Spellcraft; (Priest, double
slot) Musical Instrument; (Rogue, double slot) Blind-fighting,
Gaming, Juggling, Tumbling.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Equipment:</B> The Wu Jen must buy all weapons from
the choices listed in the Weapon Proficiency entry above. He may have
no more than 10 gp remaining when he has finished purchasing his equipment.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Special Benefits:</B> When a Wu Jen reaches 4th
level, he gains the power to summon massive magical energies that
allow him to cast any one spell that is three or more levels lower
than his level at maximum effect. The spell automatically has maximum
range, (if desired), duration, and effect. Thus, a 4th-level Wu Jen
can cast a 1st-level spell at maximum effect. A Wu Jen can use this
ability once per day.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Special Hindrances:</B> The Wu Jen operates under
special taboos that do not affect other characters. Though the taboos
may seem trivial or even ridiculous to other characters, the Wu Jen
takes them quite seriously-- violating a taboo causes the Wu Jen to
lose levels of ability, lose spells, become ill, or even die (the DM
decides the exact penalty). A 1st-level Wu Jen has one taboo and
gains an additional taboo every five levels thereafter (at 6th level,
11th level, and so on). The DM selects the taboos. Some suggestions
follow; the Wu Jen:</FONT></P>
