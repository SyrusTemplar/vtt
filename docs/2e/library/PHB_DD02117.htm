Upon casting a <I>time stop</I> spell, the wizard causes the flow of time to stop for one round in the area
of effect. Outside this area the sphere simply seems to shimmer for an instant.
Inside the sphere, the caster is free to act for 1d3 rounds of apparent time.
The wizard can move and act freely within the area where time is stopped, but
all other creatures, except for those of demigod and greater status or unique
creatures, are frozen in their actions, for they are literally between ticks of
the time clock. (The spell duration is subjective to the caster.) Nothing can
enter the area of effect without being stopped in time also. If the wizard leaves
the area, the spell is immediately negated. When the spell duration ceases, the
wizard is again operating in normal time.
<P></P>
Note: It is recommended that the DM use a stopwatch or silently count to time
this spell. If the caster is unable to complete the intended action before the
spell duration expires, he will probably be caught in an embarrassing
situation. The use of a <I>teleport</I> spell before the expiration of the <I>time stop</I> spell is permissible.
