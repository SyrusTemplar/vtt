<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When designing a monster, avoid extremes. It is a common mistake to make a
monster incredibly tough for no reason. Really tough monsters are very rare! If a
monster has an extreme ability or combat statistic, there should be a good
reason. In the same light, fit the monster's abilities to its description. Players
need a fair chance to anticipate what the monster might do. For example, a
monster that can fly should have wings, or else usually be encountered aloft. If a
monster will have a surprising ability, keep it to just one, and have a good
reason for the surprise.
<P></P>
Not all monsters have to be evil. There are many other reasons a monster can
be dangerous without arbitrarily making it evil. For example, any creature will
fight to protect its family or territory whether it is good or evil.
<P></P>
Characters should be able to negoitate with or intimidate many creatures, but
negotiating with a monster does not always mean giving it treasure. Most
animals will put off an attack if tossed a free meal they can eat in peace;
intelligent creatures have many different motivations. Try not to force characters into
having to kill every monster they meet. If a monster is left alive after an
enounter, it might be encountered again, and become a regular part of the campaign.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>CLIMATE/TERRAIN:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Restrict your monsters reasonably. As a rule, only tool-making creatures can
be found in every climate or every terrain. Remember that the physical design of
a monster should make sense for the climate and the terrain.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>FREQUENCY:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Monsters should not dominate the landscape unless your campaign plot requires
them to. Most monsters avoid settled areas because organized groups of humans
and demihumans tend to kill them.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>
<P></P>
ORGANIZATION:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Give a lot of thought to this entry; it determines the group tendencies of the
monster. A pack can be controlled by controlling its leader. A flock, on the
other hand, has no leader, but it does have a pecking order.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>ACTIVITY CYCLE:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Most monsters need to rest. When are they out and about? When are they
sleeping? These habits should make sense with the diet and climate/terrain of the
monster.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>DIET:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">What does the monster eat? Not every monster is a man-eater. A wild bull is
just as dangerous as a tiger, but it does not eat meat. Remember, fangs and claws
imply carnivores, tusks and horns imply herbivores.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>INTELLIGENCE:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Avoid the tendency to make monsters too intelligent or too stupid. A creature
living in the middle of the jungle with no manipulative organs is not likely to
be intelligent. Really high intelligence usually implies civilization, or at
least sophisticated tools. On the other hand, monsters that must fight to
survive must have enough intelligence or other natural ability to conquer their foes.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>TREASURE:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Treasure is usually collected only by intelligent creatures. An animal type
may guard a treasure for another creature, but the treasure itself belongs to the
intelligence that set it there as a guard. Monsters that care little for
riches and magical items might still have some as a result of encounters, but things
will be scattered and ill-kept, often rusting away to worthlessness.
Intelligent monsters, on the other hand, will use their magical treasures to their best
advantage -- which may be no help at all to the characters!
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>ALIGNMENT:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This is a broad description of the moral and ethical tendencies of the
monster. A creature of animal intelligence has no morals or ethics, and hence is of
neutral alignment. In general, try to avoid extremes, unless these fit the
monster.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>NO. APPEARING:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The number of monsters typically encountered should correspond to the other
facts about the monster. A solitary monster does not travel in a pack of 20! In
general, carnivores travel in small groups, herbivores travel in large groups.
This number is also a good way to keep things balanced; weak monsters are
dangerous in large numbers, while a strong monster all alone is easy prey to a
well-organized group of heroes.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>COMBAT STATISTICS:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This includes such values as Hit Dice and Armor Class. They should match the
physical description of the monster. A well-designed monster fights the way it
looks. A small, fuzzy creature with big, soft eyes should not have 25 Hit Dice,
an Armor Class of -8, and swoop through the air to attack. The amount of damage
done should reflect the weapon being used. Avoid the tendency to give monsters
excessive Hit Dice and damage capabilities. The DM is the only person who gets
a kick from seeing a PC suffer 40 points of damage in one round; players don't
find that amusing at all.

See <A HREF="DMG_DD00383.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00383.htm">Chapter 9</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> of the <I>DMG</I> to determine THAC0 for monsters.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>APPEARANCE:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Include in the physical description of the monster its size, weight, color
(skin, hair, eyes, etc.), smell, noises, type of movement (graceful walk,
shambling gait, etc.), typical clothing, and preferred weapons.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>COMBAT:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Include any special combat abilities or disabilities. Be sure to cover any
basic strategies or tactics the monster might use. Remember, smart monsters use
smart tactics. The strategies should reflect their natural advantages and
disadvantages.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>HABITAT/SOCIETY:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">How does the monster relate to others of its kind, and to strangers? When do
they work together and when do they fight? How do they choose leaders and how do
these leaders rule? What are the goals of these monsters? Where do they live
and how does this affect their behavior? Do they use or make tools? If so, what
types and how are they made? Why does this monster have treasure? How does it
get it? What is the nature of the family, and how many live together? Does the
monster have special guards or allies and how frequently are they found together?
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>ECOLOGY</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>:</B> This should include the types of food eaten -- as well as what eats them, if
anything. Any useful by-products should be listed, such as fur or edible parts.
You may list uses for magical items or spells. On the other hand, don't turn
your monster descriptions into shopping lists. The PCs are heroes, not butchers
or fur trappers. List other creatures that live in harmony with the monster or
compete against it, along with information about the size and nature of its
territory.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>VARIANTS:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">If there are major subraces, they should be detailed here. This may be a
stronger leader type, an inferior servant race, or a DM special, such as skeletons
that hurl their finger joints like <I>magic missiles</I>.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>XP VALUE:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Guidelines for awarding experience are found in <A HREF="DMG_DD00363.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00363.htm">Chapter 8</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> of the <I>DMG</I>.

access to only devotions, +2 if the creature has both sciences and devotions.

In addition to the Hit Dice Value Modifiers listed for monsters in the <I>DMG</I>, consider the following optional modifiers: +1 for any special movement which
gives an advantage, not just flying; +2 for magic resistance over 50%, +1 for
magic resistance of 50% or under; +2 for breath weapons which can cause more
than 20 points damage per attack, +1 for other breath weapons.
