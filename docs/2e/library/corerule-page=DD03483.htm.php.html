The Library
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The single most important tool in the wizard’s laboratory is his library. <I>Every </I>wizard has a library, even if it consists of nothing more than his spell books
and a handful of old texts and journals. Depending on the campaign flavor and
the prevalence of magic, wizards may find that ancient grimoires and codices
are the only source of new spells, potion formulae, or procedures for creating
magical items. Unless they go to extraordinary lengths to unearth, purchase,
copy, or steal these books, their advancement in the arcane arts can come to a dead
halt.
<P></P>
When a character builds and outfits a laboratory of any type, a basic library
is assumed to be included in the overall price. This collection allows the
wizard to conduct the basic functions of the laboratory—brewing potions and
manufacturing special inks for scroll creation, making magical items, or conducting
spell research. However, the materials in a lab’s initial collection only allow
the character to research the formula for one potion or scroll, one magical
item, and one 1st-level spell. In effect, the library that the wizard acquires to
outfit his laboratory is only sufficient for the first two or three research
efforts he undertakes. After these initial studies, the wizard must expand his
library in order to undertake new research efforts.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Alchemists and Artificers: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">These two specialist wizards do not need to increase the size of their library
in order to discover new formulae or procedures. Their specialist abilities
bypass this requirement; the character’s expertise allows him to do without many
of the texts and canons other wizards find necessary.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Library Requirements: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Expanding a library and collecting volumes suitable for advanced research
takes time and money. The total value of the wizard’s library governs the research
he can undertake there, as shown in <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03484.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03484.htm.php.html">Table 13:</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Libraries.
<P></P>
<B>Library Expense </B>is the total investment the character makes in acquiring books, references,
and other research materials. The initial library expense is simply the cost of
the character’s laboratory, so if a wizard builds a research laboratory and then
spends 2,000 gp on expanding his initial library, he can research 2nd-level
spells.
<P></P>
<B>Number of Potion Formulae </B>represents the maximum number of potions the wizard can research given a
library of the listed size. Using the correct enchantments and materials is a
critical part of potion-brewing, and wizards must invest some time in researching the
correct formula and procedure for any particular potion. (See <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03554.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03554.htm.php.html">Chapter 7</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> .) For example, a wizard who purchases an alchemical laboratory can determine
the formula for two types of potion (<I>flying</I>, for instance) with the materials at hand, but in order to learn the formulae
for additional potions, he must spend money to expand his reference library.
<P></P>
<B>Number of Item Formulae </B>represents the maximum number of magical item creation processes the wizard
can discover using a library of the listed size. Each magical item has its own
unique “formula”—materials and procedures required to successfully produce one
item. The initial laboratory included in a forge allows the wizard to research
the creation of one type of magical item, such as a <I>rope of climbing </I>or<I> boots of the north</I>. Discovering the requirements for additional types of magical items requires
a larger and more complete library.
<P></P>
<B>Maximum Spell Research Level </B>is the highest-level spell the wizard can research, given the library at hand.
The basic research laboratory allows the wizard to research 1st-level spells,
but if he wants to indulge himself in more advanced studies, he’ll have to
obtain additional texts, references, and materials.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Finding Books: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Naturally, a library worth 10,000 gp is not a heap of treasure waiting to be
carted off by the nearest adventurer. It is a labor of love and care, created
over years by the dedicated efforts of an intelligent and well-organized
character. And, unfortunately, building a library can be a tedious and exhausting task.
Important volumes may take years to find.
<P></P>
Generally, a library is composed of books ranging in value from 50 to 500 gold
pieces, although unusual works may cost much more. Thus, a library valued at
2,000 gp might include 15 to 20 books in the 50–100 gp range, three or four
valued at 100–200 gp, and maybe one or two in the 300–500 gp range. While it’s not
necessary to catalog every single book that is contained in the collection,
it’s a good idea for the DM to identify a handful of <I>critical works</I>, or references that are so central to the wizard’s studies that the library
just isn’t complete without them. Finding or tracking down these rare volumes
can be quite a challenge, creating many adventure hooks for a PC wizard!
<P></P>
If the DM is generous, he can assume that the wizard can find everything he
needs, given time, and assume that one week of library-building allows the
character to spend up to 500 gp on books he needs. In other words, increasing a
library’s size and value by 2,000 gp would require four weeks of dedicated effort on
the wizard’s part. Finding a rare or unusual text (or, treasure of treasures,
an intact collection!) in an adventure could save a wizard a great amount of
time and money.
<P></P>
However, building a library can be far more difficult than just spending
money. In medieval societies, books were hand-written, and there might be only six
or seven copies of a book the wizard needs to be found <I>anywhere</I>, let alone in the local bookseller’s shop. Particularly rare or valuable
tomes may change hands through sale, deceit, or thievery dozens of times,
disappearing from common knowledge.
<P></P>
In addition to the problem of scarcity, it’s possible that some significant
works required by a wizard might not be written in his native language but
instead in the language of a far-off kingdom. An ambitious character might be forced
to learn his campaign’s equivalent of Latin, Sanskrit, or Mandarin Chinese for
no other purpose than to read a single book. Another problem might be
suppressed or forbidden books; trading in banned works could get a character into a lot
of trouble.
<P></P>
Last but not least, the current owner of the book the character seeks may have
no wish to part with it, especially if it’s considered dangerous or unique.
The wizard may be able to persuade the book’s owner to allow him to make a copy
of the text, or he may have to consider more direct action to acquire the
necessary materials.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Library Size: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Large collections of books require space, just like laboratories. The basic
references included in the cost of a laboratory don’t take up any additional
space above and beyond the laboratory’s requirements, but expanded libraries
require at least 25 square feet for each 2,000 gp value. For example, a library
valued at 10,000 gp would require 125 square feet (a 10-foot by 121/2-foot room).
This may sound like a generous amount of space, but keep in mind that many of
these tomes are extremely large and bulky, and require special shelving, displays,
and cabinets. All these furnishings are included in the cost of the library.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Care and Protection: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A wizard’s library is an investment of great value to the character eventually
exceeding even the most complete laboratories and forges. Naturally, the owner
should be quite interested in making sure nothing happens to it. The library
should be in a dry, secure room that is well-ventilated but not open to the
weather. Dampness can quickly mold or destroy books, especially those made without
modern preservatives. Last but not least, the wizard should consider <I>fire traps </I>or similar spells to guard the room against intruders.
