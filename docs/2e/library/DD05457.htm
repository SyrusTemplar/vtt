The DM can create as many gods for his pantheon as his imagination will allow
him. He doesn't have to work up an extensive set of legends about every god;
even in the real world, many gods of various mythologies were scarcely more than
a name and an attribute. As his campaign continues, the DM can flesh out the
descriptions of these gods to his heart's content.
<P></P>
Some of the traits which characterize the gods, and can be defined by the DM
for each god or pantheon, include:
<P></P>
<B>Immortality:</B> Are the gods immortal? In most pantheons, the gods are certainly<I> ageless</I>; that is, they do not grow old. But in some, they are not just ageless, they
also cannot be killed; regardless of how severely they might be wounded, with
time they will always fully recover from injury. In others, the gods can be
killed by sufficient force. For example, in the Greek myths, the gods are undying,
while in the Norse myths the gods face eventual certain death at the battle of
Ragnarok.
<P></P>
<B>Indestructibility:</B> As a further level of what was just described, some gods which are immortal
are also described as indestructible. No force on heaven or Earth can hurt them
(except by hurting their feelings, by betraying them). This is sometimes the
trait of the greatest god of a pantheon, and is usually the trait of the only god
of a monotheistic religion (one which believes in only one god).
<P></P>
<B>Influence on the World:</B> How much influence does the god have on the mortal world, the world of
animals, the world of plants? With some gods, there is very little of such influence.
A god whose attribute is the unchanging stars, for instance, might exert a
little influence on the sailors who navigate by stars, but could have very little
effect on anyone or anything else. On the other hand, gods relating to powerful
human emotions or preoccupations (such as love, war, creativity, and so forth)
might exert a great deal of influence on the world, especially if it is said
that every application of his attribute requires the god's help or permission.
For instance, if it requires the aid or permission of the god/goddess of
childbirth for every human birth to take place, then that deity is exerting a profound
effect on the world.
<P></P>
<B>Interest in the World:</B> Additionally, some gods are very interested in what goes on in the mortal
world, while others are entirely disinterested. Naturally, those who are
interested are more prone to meddle in mortal affairs than those who aren't. In fact,
gods who are disinterested in the world might punish characters who are bold
enough to call upon them.
<P></P>
<B>Intentions Toward the World:</B> Finally, there's the question of what the god's intentions are toward the
world . . . especially toward the sentient races of the world. Some gods are
content just to pursue their attributes and make sure they are properly worshipped
and recognized. Others may have more far-reaching plans. This is especially
true of evil gods, who wish to bring about the destruction of races, other gods,
or the entire world; it is also true of ambitious gods, who wish to cast down
the ruling gods, take their place, and reshape the world to their own liking.
<P></P>
<B>Inhibitions:</B> Some gods and pantheons had limitations placed upon them. These might have
been limitations placed by some greater power of the universe, or merely enforced
by the greatest of the gods. Often, these inhibitions dictate how much aid or
hindrance the gods can offer to mortals, whether or not they can help their
favorite men and beasts directly or indirectly, etc.

As an example of how a familiar god matches these characteristics, let's look
at the Greek goddess Aphrodite.
<P></P>
She was immortal, as were most or all of the Greek gods. She certainly was <I>not</I> indestructible, and was in fact once wounded in battle by the Argive hero
Diomedes.
<P></P>
She had a very profound influence on the world, for it was she who put all
varieties of the emotion of love in the breasts of man and beast. Even the other
gods, with the exception of Hestia, Athena, and Artemis, were regularly affected
by her power.
<P></P>
Her interest in the world was limited to a couple of areas: Making sure that
all humankind respected her (which generally meant that all humans knew love at
one time or another, and thus did not deny her); and making sure her special
favorites, such as her mortal son Aeneas, survived and prospered. Other than
that, she appeared to have no special intentions toward the world.
<P></P>
Aphrodite had a couple of inhibitions restricting her: First, she and all the
Olympians were subject to a higher destiny, which not even Zeus could thwart.
Second, physically, she and most other gods could be hurt or even defeated in
battle by the mightiest Greek heroes. Third, the god-king Zeus obviously
preferred for gods to help their favorites indirectly rather than by showing up in
person. All these inhibitions affected the way Aphrodite and the other Olympians
related to their favorite &quot;player-characters.&quot;
