finished gems. The worker needs good light and an assortment of chisels, hammers,
and hard cutting blades.

The gem cutter can do decent work without a proficiency check; the stones cut
will be valued in the typical range for that type of gem. However, if the
cutter seeks to do a unique and very high-quality job, a proficiency check is called
for. Failure means the stone is destroyed, but success results in a gem of
double the usual value.
