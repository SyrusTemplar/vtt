Any priest can specialize in Punching (or Wrestling, or Martial Arts). Of all
the types of priests, though, only the Fighting-Monk can specialize in more
than one unarmed combat style. The DM may decide for his own campaign that Priests
other than the Fighting-Monk may not specialized in any unarmed combat, or
that certain types of priests (for example, of the god of peace) may not.
<P></P>
In order to do specialize in Punching, the Priest must devote a Weapon
Proficiency slot to Punching. When he does, he gets the following benefits:
<P></P>
He gains a +1 bonus to all his attack rolls with Punching;
<P></P>
He gains a +1 bonus to all damage with Punching; and
<P></P>
He gains a +1 <I>chart bonus </I>with all Punching attacks.
<P></P>
The chart bonus is a reflection of the character's superior accuracy with
Punching. When the Fighter-Monk rolls and successfully hits, as you know, the roll
itself determines which maneuver was made.
<P></P>
But on a successful hit, the Punching Specialist can modify that result. If he
has a <I>chart bonus</I> of +1, he can choose the maneuver one higher or one lower on the chart.
<P></P>
<I>Example: The fighter-monk Toshi punches an orc. He rolls a 18 to hit, and this
turns out to be a successful hit. On the &quot;Punching and Wrestling Results&quot;
chart, we see that this is a Rabbit Punch. But Toshi is a Punching Specialist with
a chart bonus of +1. He can choose instead for the result to be a Wild Swing
(which does less damage and has an inferior chance of accomplishing a knockout)
or a Kidney Punch (which does the same damage but has a superior chance of
accomplishing a knockout). He changes the maneuver from a Rabbit Punch to a Kidney
Punch.
<P></P>
</I> Only if a character Specializes in Punching and thus has a <I>chart bonus</I> can he affect his punch results in this manner.
