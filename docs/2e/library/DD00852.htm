<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wand of Fire:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This wand can function like the following wizard spells:
<P></P>
<B>? </B><I>Burning hands:</I> The wand emits a fan-shaped sheet of fire 10 feet wide at its end and 12 feet
long. Each creature touched suffers six points of damage. The sheet of fire
appears instantly, shoots forth dark red flames, and snuffs out in less than one
second. It expends one charge.
<P></P>
<B>? </B><I>Pyrotechnics:</I> This function duplicates the spell of the same name. It has an initiative
modifier of +2 and expends one charge.
<P></P>
<B>? </B> <I>Fireball:</I> The wand coughs forth a pea-sized sphere that streaks out to the desired
range (to a maximum of 160 feet) and bursts in a fiery, violet-red blast, just like
the <I>fireball</I> spell. The initiative modifier is +2, and this expends two charges. The fireball inflicts 6d6 points of damage, but all 1s rolled are counted as 2s
(i.e., the burst causes 12-36 points). A saving throw vs. wand is applicable.
<P></P>
<B>? </B> <I>Wall of fire:</I> The wand can be used to draw a fiery curtain of purplish-red flames 1200 feet
square (10' x 120', 20' x 60', 30' x 40', etc.). The flames last for six
rounds and cause 2d6+6 points damage if touched (2d4 points if within 10 feet of the fire, 1d4 if within 20 feet). The flames can also be shaped into a ring
around the wand user (but the circle is 25 feet in diameter). The initiative
modifier is +3, and its use expends two charges.
<P></P>
The <I>wand of fire</I> can operate just once per round. It can be recharged.
