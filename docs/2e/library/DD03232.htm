<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">PSIONIC POWERS</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> There are five parameters integral to each psionic power. They are:
<P></P>
<A NAME="47976935"></A><A NAME="47976935"></A><A NAME="47976935"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>MAC:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The number that the user must roll against with an MTHAC0 roll to activate
the power against an open mind. Bonuses to a power-s MAC score make it lower,
thus harder to hit. While penalties make it higher, and thus easier to roll
against. See ?<A HREF="DD03211.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03211.htm">Using Psionic Powers</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">? for more details.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>PSP Cost:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The number of PSPs that must be spent per round to use a psionic power. The
secondary number is the PSP cost if the MTHAC0 roll fails.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Range:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The maximum distance from the user at which the power has an effect. -Touch?
requires the user to make physical contact with the target-that is, a THAC0
roll.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Area of Effect:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The physical area or number of beings a power affects. -Personal? only
affects the user.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Prerequisite:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Other sciences or devotions a character must know before being able to use a
particular power. Some prerequisites will list a level. This is the lowest
level a psionicist using this psionic power can be.
<P></P>
Once a psionicist has mastered the powers of his mind, the results can be as
spectacular as the explosive force of the psychokinetic science called detonate
or as subtle as the clairsentient devotion called see sound. Originally from <I>The Complete Book of Psionics, Dragon Kings,</I> and <I>The Will and the Way,</I> the psionic powers described in this chapter have been revised to reflect the
new psionics system.
<P></P>
Obviously, not every psionic power could be contained here. For the most part,
however, changes have been kept to a minimum and are listed on the <A HREF="DD03297.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03297.htm">Psionic Powers Summary</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. The summary provides the statistics needed to convert existing powers to the
new system. The revised statistics, the MAC score, and the reconfigured PSP
cost replace the power score, initial cost, and maintenance cost from the old
psionics system.
<P></P>
The powers are divided alphabetically into the five disciplines (<A HREF="DD03233.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03233.htm">clairsentience</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, <A HREF="DD03247.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03247.htm">psychokinesis</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, <A HREF="DD03260.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03260.htm">psychometabolism</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, <A HREF="DD03273.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03273.htm">psychoportation</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, and <A HREF="DD03284.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03284.htm">telepathy</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). The major powers (sciences) are presented first in each section, followed
by the minor powers (devotions). Each entry includes certain parameters, as
described in the accompanying sidebar.
<P></P>
If you-re new to psionics, skip the following paragraph. The explanation of
the changes from the old psionics system to the new may be confusing. If you-ve
used psionics often in your past campaigns, however, the following paragraph may
help you understand the <I>why</I> behind some of the system changes.
<P></P>
Power scores have been replaced by MAC scores, as the base mechanic for
psionics has been changed from a proficiency system to a combat system. Initial costs
and maintenance costs have been combined into a single PSP cost. Preparation
time has been eliminated. Optional results also have been eliminated, though
they can still be used if DMs and players desire.
