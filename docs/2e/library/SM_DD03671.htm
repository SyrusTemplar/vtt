The most humble of priestly spells is the orison, a brief prayer or invocation
of a minor nature. Typically, priests learn a number of <I>orisons </I>as acolytes or students in order to hone their spellcasting skills and
emphasize concepts, ideals, or phrases of particular importance to the faith. Because
an <I>orisons </I>is not even on par with other 1st-level magic, a priest memorizes a number of
individual <I>orisons </I>equal to three +1 per level (up to a maximum of nine) when he devotes a
1st-level spell slot to <I>orison</I>. In other words, a 1st-level priest can memorize four <I>orisons </I>for one 1st-level spell slot, a 2nd-level priest can memorize five, and so on.
<P></P>
Unlike <I>cantrip</I>, an <I>orison </I>must have a specific effect, although the priest need not decide which
incantation he will use until he actually casts the spell. Regardless of the prayer
chosen, the <I>orison-s </I>duration is never more than one round per level. Known <I>orisons </I>include the following:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Alleviate: </B>A single creature suffering from nausea or pain is relieved of its discomfort.
Magically induced nausea or pain is only alleviated if the victim passes a
saving throw vs. spell with a ?2 penalty.
<P></P>
<B>Calm: </B>A single creature that has been startled or frightened is soothed. Victims
suffering from magical fear may attempt a save vs. spell with a ?2 penalty to calm
themselves.
<P></P>
<B>Clarity: </B>For the duration of the orison, the priest-s speech is clear and free of
impediment-useful for readings from sacred texts and other such rites. Magical
conditions such as <I>confuse languages </I>cannot be overcome by this <I>orison</I>.
<P></P>
<B>Courage: </B>The priest gains a +1 bonus to his next attack roll, as long as the attack is
made within the spell-s duration.
<P></P>
<B>Guidance: </B>The priest gains a +1 bonus to a Wisdom or Intelligence check to determine the
right course of action in a moral dilemma or puzzle.
<P></P>
<B>Healing: </B>By his touch, the priest may heal a creature of 1 point of damage.
<P></P>
<B>Magic sense: </B>If there is a persistent spell effect or magical item within 10 yards, the
priest feels a recognizable tingle or sensation of some kind. He has no way to
determine what item or spell may have caused the reaction.
<P></P>
<B>Memory: </B>Any item the priest commits to memory during the spell duration is more
completely and permanently learned; he gains a +2 bonus to any checks to recall the
exact appearance, wording, or meaning of an item, text, or message.
<P></P>
<B>Resistance to magic: </B>The caster gains a +1 bonus to his next saving throw against magic of any
type, as long as it occurs during the <I>orison-s </I>duration.
<P></P>
<B>Resistance to poison: </B>The priest gains a +1 bonus to his next saving throw vs. poison, as long as it
occurs during the <I>orison-s </I>duration.
<P></P>
Other orisons of similar power or scope may be permitted by the DM. Generally,
an <I>orison </I>should not affect more than one creature or die roll at a time, and an <I>orison </I>that can actually cause immediate harm to a creature should inflict no more
than 1 or 2 points of damage. An offensive <I>orison </I>would be quite rare and most probably associated with an evil or chaotic
priesthood.
