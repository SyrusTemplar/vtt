<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Robe of Blending:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This ordinary-appearing robe cannot be detected by magical means. When it is
put on, however, the wearer will know that the garment has very special
properties. A <I>robe of blending</I> enables its wearer to appear to be part of a rock wall or a plant—whatever is
appropriate. It can even make the wearer appear to be a creature of his choice.
<P></P>
The robe does have its limits: It will not make its wearer appear to be more
than twice normal height or less than one-half normal. It does not impart vocal
capabilities—either understanding or imitating the creature the wearer looks
like. (In situations where several different forms are appropriate, the wearer is
obliged to state which form he wishes the robe to camouflage him as.)
<P></P>
Creatures with exceptional (15+) or better Intelligence have a 1% per
Intelligence point chance of detecting something amiss when they are within 30 feet of
someone disguising himself with a <I>robe of blending.</I> Creatures with low Intelligence or better and 10 or more levels of experience
or Hit Dice have a 1% chance per level or Hit Die of likewise noting something
unusual about a robe-wearing character. (The latter is cumulative with the
former chance for detection, so an 18 Intelligence wizard of 12th level has a 30%
chance—18% + 12%—of noting something amiss.) After an initial check per
eligible creature, successive checks should be made each turn thereafter, if the same
creatures are within the 30-foot range. All creatures acquainted with and
friendly to the wearer will see him normally.
