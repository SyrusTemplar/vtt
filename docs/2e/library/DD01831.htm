When an <I>identify</I> spell is cast, magical items subsequently touched by the wizard can be
identified. The eight hours immediately preceding the casting of the spell must be
spent purifying the items and removing influences that would corrupt and blur
their magical auras. If this period is interrupted, it must be begun again. When
the spell is cast, each item must be handled in turn by the wizard. Any
consequences of this handling fall fully upon the wizard and may end the spell,
although the wizard is allowed any applicable saving throw.
<P></P>
The chance of learning a piece of information about an item is equal to 10%
per level of the caster, to a maximum of 90%, rolled by the DM. Any roll of 96-00
indicates a false reading (91-95 reveals nothing). Only one function of a
multifunction item is discovered per handling (i.e., a 5th-level wizard could
attempt to determine the nature of five different items, five different functions of
a single item, or any combination of the two). If any attempt at reading
fails, the caster cannot learn any more about that item until he advances a level.
Note that some items, such as special magical tomes, cannot be identified with
this spell.
<P></P>
The item never reveals its exact attack or damage bonuses, although the fact
that it has few or many bonuses can be determined. If it has charges, only a
general indication of the number of charges remaining is learned: powerful (81% -
100% of the total possible charges), strong (61% - 80%), moderate (41% - 60%),
weak (6% - 40%), or faint (five charges or less). The faint result takes
precedence, so a fully charged <I>ring of three wishes</I> always appears to be only faintly charged.
<P></P>
After casting the spell and determining what can be learned from it, the
wizard loses 8 points of Constitution. He must rest for one hour to recover each
point of Constitution. If the 8-point loss drops the spellcaster below a
Constitution of 1, he falls unconscious. Consciousness is not regained until full
Constitution is restored, which takes 24 hours (one point per three hours for an
unconscious character).
<P></P>
The material components of this spell are a pearl (of at least 100 gp value)
and an owl feather steeped in wine; the infusion must be drunk prior to
spellcasting. If a <I>luckstone</I> is powdered and added to the infusion, the divination becomes much more
potent: Exact bonuses or charges can be determined, and the functions of a
multifunctional item can be learned from a single reading. At the DM's option, certain
properties of an artifact or relic might also be learned.
