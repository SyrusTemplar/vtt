</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Utter the words -high-level character? to just about any group of AD&amp;D? game
fans and you are certain to get a strong reaction. Veteran players often shake
their heads in disgust, but there are a few whose eyes gleam with fond memories.
Referees often look pained or confused. Everyone, it seems, has an opinion
about high-level play.

If you are a fan of high-level campaigns, there is very little I can say about
this book. You have probably already thumbed through the pages, lingering over
the choicest bits. Perhaps you-ve studied the rules and tables of legendary
monsters in <A HREF="DD01247.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01247.htm">Chapter 2</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> or considered the possibilities that the new character powers from <A HREF="DD01360.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01360.htm">Chapter 7</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> can bring to your game. Enjoy!

If your opinion of high-level play is lukewarm or worse, you might be
wondering why I wrote this book at all. I-ll share a secret with you. Before I started
this book, I wasn-t any too fond of high-level play either. My mind began to
change, however, as I began planning the book and talking to people about what it
should contain. Although high-level play can be difficult, I learned that
there have been plenty of successful high-level campaigns over the years.
<P></P>
Along the way, I began thinking about an old character I once played: Ellis
Strongheart. Ellis began life as a 1st-level ranger full of spunk, and he wound
up as a the lord of a huge castle. Ellis had a list of powerful enemies as long
as your arm and an equally long list of allies, including a time-traveling
dragon and a host of servants and retainers. The campaign that gave birth to Ellis
is long gone, but Ellis is now firmly ensconced in my own campaign as an NPC.
The players in my game are strangely attracted to Ellis (lesser mortals call him
Lord Strongheart). Ellis is very much a viable character, with a long history
and an enigmatic reputation. To me, Ellis is proof that high-level play can be
worthwhile, even if it does get rather wild.

This book-s first chapter, The Seven Maxims, discusses what DMs have to do to
make sure their campaigns stand up to the rigors of high-level play. All
campaigns require work, but high-level games require a special touch, and it is the
lack of that knowledge that causes many high-level games to go astray. If you
have tried a high-level game and failed, the material in the first two chapters
should help you avoid critical mistakes. The rest of the book provides ideas for
keeping a game-and its player characters-fresh. There are rules and
suggestions for building adventures and whole new worlds, conducting magical duels, and
making magical items. Two chapters are worth special note: <A HREF="DD01317.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01317.htm">Chapter 6</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, True Dweomers, and <A HREF="DD01350.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01350.htm">Chapter 7</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, High-Level Characters. Both of these chapters introduce new powers into the
game.

True dweomers are essentially 10th-level spells. I included them not just to
satisfy power gamers, but to allow high-level spellcasters to create
world-shaking magic. When the rules are used properly, the casting of a single true
dweomer can keep a group of PCs busy for a long time. <A HREF="DD01350.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01350.htm">Chapter 7</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> includes some hard-and-fast rules about what characters can do. In it there
is a <A HREF="DD01352.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01352.htm">revised rule</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> for automatic failure of saving throws-something that places a little fear
back into high-level character-s lives-and a host of new powers. Don-t be put off
by these new abilities; their purpose is twofold: First, they give players
something to look forward to. No longer do high-level characters simply accumulate
more hit points once they reach 9th or 10th level. Second, they put truly epic
abilities into the hands of player characters. These new powers are not going
to allow PCs to lay waste to the countryside, but using one indisputably marks
a character as a legendary figure. That-s what high-level play is all about.
