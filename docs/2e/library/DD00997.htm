<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Manual of Stealthy Pilfering:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This is a guide to expertise at thievery. It is so effective that any thief or
bard who reads it and then spends one month practicing the skills therein will
gain enough experience points to place him at the mid-point of the next higher
level. The text disappears after reading, but knowledge is retained for three
months. As with other magical texts of this sort, however, the knowledge cannot
be recorded or repeated to others. Any additional reading of a similar manual
is of no benefit to the character.
<P></P>
Fighters and wizards are unable to comprehend the work. Priests, rangers, and
paladins who read even a word of the book suffer 5d4 points of damage, are
stunned for a like number of rounds, and, if a saving throw vs. spell is failed,
they lose 5,000-20,000 experience points as well. In addition, such characters
must <I>atone</I> within one day or lose one point of Wisdom.
