<FONT SIZE="3">This spell reveals to the caster all spells,
enchantments, dweomers, and magical properties present in one
creature or object. One property, spell, or power is revealed each
round in approximate order of when the spells were cast or the
properties were acquired. (If the DM doesn&#146;t know which spells
were placed on the subject first, a random roll for order of
discovery is fine.) The caster has a base 50% chance to discern the
existence and identity of a particular spell or property, +2% per
level to a maximum of 99%. The only enchantments that remain
inscrutable to <I>analyze dweomer </I>are those surrounding artifacts
or relics.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>A 16th-level wizard finds an unknown wand and
decides to use </I>analyze dweomer <I>to study it. The DM knows that
it&#146;s a </I>wand of fire<I>, and he decides that the spells </I>enchant
an item, fireball, burning hands, <I>and </I>wall of fire <I>were
used to create the wand, in that order. In the first round, the
wizard has an 82% chance to identify </I>enchant an item<I>; in the
following round, an 82% chance to discover </I>fireball<I>; in the
next round, an 82% chance to perceive </I>burning hands<I>; and so
on, for all remaining enchantments. Note that the DM could have
decided that any rare or unusual materials or processes used to
create the wand would also be revealed as if they were spells.</I></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">After the wizard analyzes one object or creature, the
spell ends, even if its duration has not expired yet. Casting this
spell is physically taxing; the wizard must pass a system shock check
or be exhausted and unable to do anything but rest for the next 1d8
hours. While this spell is most frequently used in the comfort and
safety of the wizard&#146;s laboratory, a mage could also cast <I>analyze
dweomer </I>to study the magical seals and barriers on a portal, to
determine just how a companion has been cursed, or to examine a
potential opponent for defensive spells.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The material component for this spell is a tiny lens
of ruby or sapphire set in a small golden loop. The gemstone must be
worth at least 1,000 gp.</FONT></P>
