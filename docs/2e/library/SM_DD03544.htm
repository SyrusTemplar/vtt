</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Priests of druidical or agricultural powers may be able to use preserving
magic (see <A HREF="DD03523.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03523.htm">Defilers and Preservers</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> ). Preservers draw their magical energy from the lifeforce that surrounds
them but are careful not to draw too much. If the preserving magic system is
allowed for wizards, this option should not be available for priests—it’s a good
idea to keep the flavor and methodology of wizard magic and priest magic distinct
and separate.

Preservers strongly resemble ritual priests, since both must gather their
energy before casting their spells, but preservers harness the lifeforce around
them, while ritual priests rely on the power of their deity.
