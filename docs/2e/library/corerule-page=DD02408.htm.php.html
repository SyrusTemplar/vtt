done before the round ends.

Fatigue is a measure of the character’s endurance over a prolonged combat. At
the end of each round, the character checks to see if the combat has lasted
long enough for him to become fatigued or exhausted.
<P></P>
Retreats occur when a figure is forced to fall back by the press of the fight.
This can have the effect of breaking up an enemy line or forcing the
retreating character over a cliff, into quicksand, and so on.
<P></P>
The DM makes morale checks for the monsters, if appropriate. Most creatures
don’t care to carry a losing battle to their own deaths and will try to break off
the fight if things aren’t going their way.
<P></P>
Last but not least, characters who are suffering from spell effects, poison,
or special critical hits suffer damage or fight off the effect. The exact
procedure is determined by the type of condition the character is suffering from.
