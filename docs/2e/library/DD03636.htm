<FONT SIZE="3">By means of this spell, the wizard places a magical
command upon a creature of 7 Hit Dice or less to carry out some
service, undertake a task, or refrain from some action or course of
activity. The caster specifies the conditions of the <I>lesser geas </I>when
he casts the spell; the victim must be intelligent, conscious, able
to understand the caster, and not under the influence of any spells
or effects that affect or control its mind. The <I>lesser geas </I>cannot
compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that will result in
certain death, although the wizard can use the spell to coerce the
subject into almost any other nondestructive course of action. The
victim is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the <I>lesser geas</I>,
but suffers a &#150;2 penalty on its save if the wizard is of higher
level or Hit Dice, or a &#150;4 penalty if the wizard is more than
twice the victim&#146;s level or Hit Dice.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The wizard must be careful in the wording of his <I>lesser
geas </I>since the casting and fulfillment are tricky. The subject
should be given a tangible, achievable goal, with clear courses of
action available to him. &#147;Climb that mountain!&#148; or
&#147;Tear that mountain down rock by rock!&#148; are legitimate
geases, but a geas such as &#147;Become a mountain!&#148; is just not
specific enough to work.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Similar to the 6th-level spell <I>geas</I>, the <I>lesser
geas </I>compels the subject to obey the wizard&#146;s command. If
the <I>geased </I>creature fails to follow the wizard&#146;s
instructions, it will grow sick&#151;each week that passes, the
creature loses one point from each ability score, 1 hit point per Hit
Die, and suffers a cumulative &#150;1 penalty to attack rolls and
saving throws. These penalties cannot reduce an ability score to less
than 3, reduce a creature to less than 1 hit point per Hit Die, or
reduce its attacks and saves by more than 4 points. The <I>lesser
geas </I>can be countermanded by a <I>remove curse </I>spell, or a <I>limited
wish </I>or <I>wish</I>. However, if the subject entertains thoughts
of removing the <I>lesser geas</I>, it will protect itself by giving
the subject a warning headache. If the subject persists, then the
sickness will begin,</FONT></P>
