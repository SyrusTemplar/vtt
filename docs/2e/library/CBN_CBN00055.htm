<FONT SIZE="3">With the touch of a bare hand, the necromancer can
infect a victim with a deadly disease (see Chapter Three for notes on
the plague and leprosy, or the description for </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="PHB_DD02178.htm">cure
disease</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> in the<I> PHB</I>).
Alternatively, the necromancer&#146;s touch may inflict mummy rot or
a permanent version of <I>contagion</I>. The DM must decide on the
single effect of a scabrous touch.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">This power operates continuously and cannot be
controlled (ordinarily, the wizard will wear a glove over the deadly
hand to protect those nearby). The first symptoms of the disease
appear 1&#150;10 rounds after physical contact occurs with the
wizard&#146;s deadly hand, though it may take weeks (or, in the case
of leprosy, much longer) for the disease to run its full course. This
magical disease may only be cured by a wizard, priest, or paladin of
higher level than the necromancer.</FONT></P>
