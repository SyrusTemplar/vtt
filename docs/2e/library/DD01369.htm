Wizards </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">High-level wizards are unquestionably the most powerful characters in the
campaign. While physically weak, the right combination of protective magical items
can make them all but invulnerable to attack except by high-level warriors—who
often have a hard time getting close enough to make melee attacks—and other
high-level wizards. Wizards continue to receive extra proficiencies and hit points
until level 30. Wizards receive very little in the way of special skills once
they reach 20th level, as their ability to create magical items and cast an
ever-increasing number of spells—including 10th-level spells—gives them a great
deal of power already.
