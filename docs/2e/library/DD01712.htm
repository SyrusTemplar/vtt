<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The first step in making a missile attack is to find the range from the
attacker to the target. This is measured in yards from one point to the other. This
distance is compared to the range categories for the weapon used (see <A HREF="DD01625.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01625.htm">Table 45</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> in Chapter 6: Combat).
<P></P>
If the distance is greater than the long range given, the target is out of
range; if the distance is between the long- and medium-range numbers, the target
is at long range; when between the medium- and short-range numbers, medium range
is used; when equal to or less than the short-range distance, the target is at
short range.
<P></P>
Short-range attacks suffer no range modifier. Medium-range attacks suffer a -2
penalty to the attack roll. Long-range attacks suffer a -5 penalty. Some
weapons have no short range since they must arc a certain distance before reaching
their target. These attacks are always made with an attack roll penalty.
