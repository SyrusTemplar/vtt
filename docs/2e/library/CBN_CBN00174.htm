<B>Physical Description: </B>Sarzec was once a tall and handsome man, but a previous accident has left him
a crippled hunchback with horribly twisted legs. He walks slowly and painfully
in a bowlegged gait, but he stubbornly refuses to seek medical treatment. The
prideful wizard will not even use a staff or cane as a crutch. Sarzec is
approaching his early thirties, but his blue eyes are ringed with darkness, and his
raven-black hair is shot with silver. He has a loud and commanding voice and
speaks with an air of determination.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Background:</B> Formerly an apprentice of the necromancer Pizentios (see his NPC sheet),
Sarzec fell into an oubliette while feeding one of his Master-s prisoners on Sahu.
The fall shattered his body, but he survived, and his life was spared by the
escaping prisoners. Enraged by his student-s failure, Pizentios refused to set
the broken bones, which healed and fused at awkward angles, leaving him a
permanent cripple. Pizentios successfully convinced Sarzec that the prisoners were to
blame for his disfigurement, and when Sarzec finished his studies, the master
even outfitted him with a ship and a zombie crew to hunt down the renegade
sailors who crippled him.
<P></P>
Sarzec now scours the seas in a trim caravel, the <I>Scrofula</I>, with a junior necromancer and a crew of zombies. They patrol the sea lanes
near the Isle of Sahu, preying upon understaffed merchant ships, constantly on
the lookout for the adventurers who wrecked Sarzec-s body and filled his life
with unending pain. The necromancers have a small base on Sahu and report back
occasionally to Pizentios, who is pleased with their progress and keeps them well
outfitted in exchange for prisoners and tribute. Sarzec enjoys the current
arrangement with his former mentor (and as an Undead Master, he revels in the
command of an undead crew), but his thirst for revenge takes him on ever wider
forays from the coast of Sahu.
<P></P>
As a natural leader, Sarzec enjoys the complete authority over his undead
crew. These twenty zombies (hp 12?16 each) have been fortified by <I>embalming</I>, which also prevents them from decomposing in the intense sun and heat at
sea.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Role-Playing Notes:</B> Sarzec is a cruel, foul-tempered bully who suffers in constant physical pain
from his old injuries. He lashes out, often violently, against any who disagree
with his opinion (these are scarce on a ship crewed mostly by mindless
undead). In battle, Sarzec-s first action is usually to cast <I>spirit armor</I> in defense, then use a <I>lightning bolt</I> to soften up the enemy while sending over a zombie boarding party. He then
casts <I>spectral hand</I> to deliver touch-related attacks, afterward animating a pair of <I>skeletal hands</I> or casting <I>bone dance</I> on a fallen foe. He will not hesitate to use his magical bead, scroll, or
poisoned darts if pressed in battle.
<P></P>
Sarzec-s intelligent mind has easily grown accustomed to sea travel. He
chooses his potential victims carefully, always screening their ships from a safe
distance with the help of his huge raven familiar, Malvolio. If a target seems
weak or helpless, he maneuvers the <I>Scrofula </I>so it has the wind advantage and attacks. The <I>Scrofula</I> has been rigged for speed. Lacking heavy supplies or cargo and forewarned by
Malvolio-s reconnaissance, she can outrun most merchant ships.
