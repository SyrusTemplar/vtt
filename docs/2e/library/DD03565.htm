Other Items</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
This broad category includes all other types of magical items, including
rings, wands, staves, rods, miscellaneous magical items, and weapons and armor.
Player characters can manufacture almost any kind of magical item appearing in the <A HREF="DMG_DD00521.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00521.htm">DMG</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> , except for magical books, tomes, manuals, librams, grimoires, or artifacts
of any kind.
<P></P>
In addition, a player character may be restricted from creating a particular
item by his class. Wizards can create <I>any </I>magical item that is not specifically reserved for the use of priest
characters (i.e., an item such as a <I>staff of curing</I>) or limited to certain races (such as <I>boots of elvenkind</I>). Racial items are created by priests of that particular race. If the item
can be used by other characters as well as priests (for example, <I>helm of teleportation</I>), the wizard can manufacture the item. On the other hand, priests and
specialist wizards can only create items that they can use. When creating an item, a
specialist wizard gains a +5% bonus to his chance of succeeding.
<P></P>
The most important aspect of an item’s enchantment has very little to do with
its purpose or form. Magical items are divided into several loose classes that
are based on the nature of the enchantment: single-use, limited-use,
single-function, and multiple-function.
<P></P>
<A NAME="c66f0479"></A>
<P></P>
<B>Single-use </B>items are depleted after a single usage. Most potions and scrolls fall into
this category, but these have been discussed already. Other single-use magical
items include such things as <I>beads of force</I>, <I>incense of meditation</I>, or any of <I>Quaal’s feather tokens</I>.
<P></P>
<A NAME="90338d33"></A>
<P></P>
<B>Limited-use </B>items have a set or variable number of charges that may be used before it is
expended. Some
<P></P>
limited-use items can be recharged, but only if they are recharged before
their last charge has been expended. Other limited-use items may have
multiple-functions (see below). Most wands and staves are limited-use items. Other
limited-use items include such devices as a <I>ring of wishes, bag of beans, scarab of protection, </I>or the special properties of <I>armor of fear</I>.
<P></P>
<A NAME="e0ac6ef8"></A>
<P></P>
<B>Single-function </B>items have only one power, which functions continuously or on demand. Some
single-function items have time limitations, after which they cannot be used until
they replenish their magical energy. Some single-function items may feature a
limited-use feature, in addition to the persistent powers. Items such as a <I>ring of shocking grasp, amulet of life protection, boots of speed, </I>and <I>wings of flying </I>are good examples of single-function items.
<P></P>
<A NAME="a15968c4"></A>
<P></P>
<B>Multiple-function </B>items have more than one power and may also feature additional limited-use
powers. Good examples include the <I>rod of alertness, ring of elemental command, cloak of arachnida, </I>or the <I>helm of brilliance</I>.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Level Requirements: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Both wizards and priests must be at least 11th level to create any kind of
magical item other than a potion or a scroll. Wizards are also limited by the
spells required to actually create the item—<I>enchant an item, permanency</I>, and any other appropriate spells. Priests, on the other hand, do not cast
spells to create items, but instead use a consecrated altar (see <A HREF="DD03476.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03476.htm">Chapter 5</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> ).
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Facilities: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Wizards require a well-equipped forge and may need to expand their personal
libraries in order to conduct the necessary research. (Again, refer to <A HREF="DD03476.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03476.htm">Chapter 5</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> .) Priests must have access to a specially consecrated altar. In addition,
both wizards and priests may find it very useful to have some skilled assistants
nearby.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Research: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Before a character can begin work on a magical item, he must first discover
the steps necessary to create it! This requires research time and effort.
Generally, a character must spend 1d6+1 weeks and 200 gp per week in order to find out
how to build the item, although the DM may rule that exceptionally powerful
items (5,000 XP value or greater, or any item such as a <I>girdle of giant strength </I>that imparts drastic and persistent bonuses to a character) requires
consultation with a sage or some special effort on the part of the character to research.
<P></P>
<I>Contact other plane </I>and <I>commune </I>spells are particularly useful in this step of item creation, since the
successful use of one of these divinations reduces the research time to the minimum
required.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Processes and Materials: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The exact nature of the processes and materials required varies from item to
item depending on its category and type. However, all items require an <I>enchant an item </I>spell (or the equivalent priestly ceremony), and many require a <I>permanency </I>spell to boot.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="fee79d27"></A><A NAME="fee79d27"></A>
<P></P>
<B>Rings </B>require one common process, usually some type of carving, engraving, pouring,
shaping, or forging. In addition to this process, magical rings have other
requirements based on their type:
<P></P>
<P></P>
Single-function rings require one exotic material;
<P></P>
Multiple-function rings require one exotic material and one exotic process per
<P></P>
function;
<P></P>
Limited-use rings require one exotic material and one exotic process per use.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Rings created by wizards must be prepared with an <I>enchant an item </I>spell and finished with a <I>permanency </I>spell, although charged rings such as the <I>ring of the ram </I>do not require the <I>permanency </I>spell, since it can be recharged. Naturally, the character must also cast any
spells required for spell-like functions.
<P></P>
<A NAME="ae04168d"></A><A NAME="ae04168d"></A>
<P></P>
<B>Rods, staves, and wands</B> are not completed with a <I>permanency </I>spell and lose their magic if their charges are ever completely exhausted.
Again, the type of item determines what processes and materials are required:
<P></P>
<P></P>
Single-function wands and staves require one rare material and one rare
process;
<P></P>
Single-use or single-function rods require one exotic material and one rare
<P></P>
process;
<P></P>
Multiple-function rods, staves, or wands require one exotic material, and one
<P></P>
exotic process per function;
<P></P>
Limited-use rods, staves, or wands require one exotic material, and one exotic
<P></P>
process per use.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Materials for these devices could include the actual shaft or handle, a
special headpiece or crystal, or special heels or caps for the ends. Processes might
include carving, engraving, painting, or tempering.
<P></P>
<A NAME="81f248d8"></A>
<P></P>
<B>Miscellaneous magical items </B>require an enchant an item spell (or the appropriate priestly ceremony), but
single-use and limited-use items do not require <I>permanency </I>spells.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Single-use and single-function items require one exotic material and one
exotic
<P></P>
process;
<P></P>
Limited-use items require one exotic material per function and two exotic
<P></P>
processes per use;
<P></P>
Multiple-function items require one exotic material per function, one exotic
<P></P>
process, and one rare process per function.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Naturally, the materials and processes used will vary widely with the nature
of the item in question. Considering that miscellaneous magic includes
everything from articles of clothing to boats and decks of cards, the actual
construction or creation of the item could include anything imaginable! See <A HREF="DD03562.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03562.htm">Special Ingredients</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>for ideas.
<P></P>
<A NAME="71dfa1f0"></A><A NAME="71dfa1f0"></A><A NAME="71dfa1f0"></A><A NAME="71dfa1f0"></A>
<P></P>
<B>Magical weapons and armor </B>require an <I>enchant an item </I>and a <I>permanency </I>spell or the priestly equivalents (see pages 121–122 in the <A HREF="DMG_DD00530.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00530.htm">DMG</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> ). In addition, devices with expendable charges (<I>armor of fear</I>, for example) must be imbued with the appropriate spells. Weapons and armor
that have no special properties except for conferring combat bonuses are
considered single-function items; items with <I>blending, command, disruption, throwing, hurling, accuracy, speed, distance,
venom, homing, lightning, piercing, sharpness, wounding, </I>or <I>vorpal </I>properties are considered multiple-function items. Armors that have special
but expendable properties (<I>fear </I>and <I>etherealness</I>) are limited-use items; and expendable items such as magical arrows or
javelins are single-use items.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Single-use weapons require one rare material and one common process;
<P></P>
Single-function weapons and armors require one exotic material, one common
<P></P>
process, and one rare process;
<P></P>
Multiple-function weapons and armors require one exotic material and process,
<P></P>
one rare process, and one common process per function;
<P></P>
Limited-use armors and weapons require one exotic material and process, one
<P></P>
rare process, and one common process per use.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cost and Time: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Again, the cost and time required to manufacture magical items varies
depending on the category and the type of item. For example, if a mage wishes to create
a single-function ring worth 1,000 XP, then he must not only spend 1,000 gp
(see the “Cost in XP” column of <A HREF="DD03566.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03566.htm">Table 38</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Magical Item Cost and Time Requirements), but he must also spend 10 weeks
(one week for every 100 gp spent) constructing the item.
<P></P>
The cost of any special processes or materials is not included in the base
cost to create the item, so if a wizard discovers that he must crush one hundred
pearls to create his <I>dust of disappearance</I>, it’s up to him to find the pearls. The time requirements do not include any
special quests or processes the character must undertake in order to create the
item.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Success or Failure: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">All magical items that fall into this broad category share the same success
roll. Assuming the character follows all the necessary steps, there is a base 60%
chance of success, +1% per caster level, –1% per spell or special process
required to create the item. (The caster’s initial <I>enchant an item </I>or finishing <I>permanency </I>spells do not count against his success chance.) While specialist wizards
receive a 5% bonus to their success chance when creating an item using abilities
from their school of specialization, artificers gain a special 10% bonus to their
success chance due to their superior item-crafting skills.
<P></P>
At the DM’s option, characters who display exceptional ingenuity or go to
extreme lengths to create an item from the very best, most appropriate materials
and processes available may receive an additional bonus of +5% to +15% on their
success chance.
<P></P>
If the character rolls a 96 or higher on his success check, the item is cursed
in some way. For example, a character attempting to produce a <I>cloak of displacement </I>might create a <I>cloak of poisonousness </I>instead. If for some reason the character was trying to create a cursed item,
a roll of 96 or higher is a simple failure—he doesn’t create a beneficial
device instead!
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I> Thedaric is a 14th-level fire mage who decides to create a </I>wand of fire <I>for those times when he’s low on memorized spells. He easily meets the level
requirement and spends a little money refurbishing a laboratory (in this case, a
forge) that he found in the ruins of an archmage’s tower. The forge comes with
a library sufficient for researching the </I>wand of fire <I>(it’s the first item Thedaric has tried to make). Thedaric uses a contact
other plane spell to minimize his research effort, so he only requires two weeks
and 400 gp to learn how to create the wand.
<P></P>
As described in the <A HREF="DMG_DD00846.htm"></A></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="DMG_DD00846.htm">DMG</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> , the </I>wand of fire <I>is a multiple-function item (it has four separate uses), and a limited-use
item, since it uses charges. The DM decides that the wand requires one exotic
material, and four exotic processes, in addition to the necessary spells, cost, and
time. Thedaric discovers that the wand must be forged by a master smith of the
azer (a race of fire-dwarves from the Elemental Plane of Fire), from brass
smelted in the efreeti City of Brass, tempered by the fiery breath of an adult red
dragon, graven while still soft with runes of power, using a fire sapphire (a
mythical gemstone the DM just made up on the spot), and finally polished with a
mixture containing the ash of a thousand year-old tree destroyed by fire. With
a heavy sigh, Thedaric sets out on months of quests, challenges, and
adventures, arranging all of the materials and processes.
<P></P>
Several months later, everything’s ready. Thedaric journeys to the elemental
plane of fire, obtains the efreeti brass, gets the azer smith to work it into a
wand, engraves it with the fire sapphire, tricks a dragon into tempering it,
and finally polishes and finishes the item in his own workshop with his special
mixture of ash. The construction of the item required an amount of gold equal to
one-fifth the wand’s XP value (900 gp in this case) and 4 weeks per 100 gp,
for a total of 36 weeks of forging, tempering, and polishing!
<P></P>
Thedaric is well-satisfied with his work so far, but now he has to make the
wand magical. First, he’ll need to use enchant an item in order to prepare the
wand to receive spells. After four days, the enchant an item is finished, and
Thedaric attempts a saving throw vs. spell to see if it succeeded. His
elementalist bonuses to saving throws vs. fire apply, and Thedaric passes with a
surprisingly close shave. He then casts </I>burning hands, pyrotechnics, fireball<I>, and </I>wall of fire <I>into the wand. Each spell requires 2d4 hours per spell level, so this ends up
taking several days in and of itself. Since he must check the success of each
enchantment and doesn’t know if any one spell will take, Thedaric casts another
battery of the same spells into the wand, just to make sure that he gets all
the functions desired—at worst, the wand will have a few extra charges on it, so
this is a reasonable precaution against the possibility of failing in one of
these steps. Since the </I>wand of fire <I>is a limited-use item, it does not require a </I>permanency <I>spell to complete it; after his second round of spells, Thedaric declares that
he is finished. (He’s not worried about stocking up on charges right now; he
just wants to complete the initial enchantment, and recharge the wand to its
maximum potential later.)
<P></P>
The DM rolled saving throws vs. spells for each spell Thedaric placed into the
wand, and as it turns out, the extra four spells were an unnecessary
precaution; Thedaric succeeded the first time around. Now the DM checks to see if the
overall process was a success or failure. The base chance of success for a wand
is 60%, plus 14% for Thedaric’s level, –12% for spells and special processes.
The DM decides that Thedaric was particularly resourceful, and gives him a +10%
bonus, and since Thedaric is a fire specialist, he gains an additional +5%
bonus, for a total success chance of 77%. Thedaric succeeds and now has a </I>wand of fire<I>; the DM decides that the spells he placed into the wand became its first 8
charges (each spell was cast into the wand twice.)
<P></P>
Now, Thedaric will probably seek to recharge the wand. Recharging items
requires another enchant an item spell, but this one is automatically successful. He
can then begin to place spells into the wand to increase the number of charges,
up to its maximum of 50. So, after close to a year of adventuring and
construction, Thedaric finishes his </I>wand of fire<I>! Considering the immense time and effort this took a 14th-level character,
you can see why magical items should be rare and unusual things!
<P></P>
