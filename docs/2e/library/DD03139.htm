<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Powerful Enemy:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A powerful enemy is a disadvantage that must be incorporated into the
background and story of a campaign?obviously, with a lot of input from the DM. A
character with a powerful enemy acquired that bitter foe before the start of the
campaign. The enemy can be a monster, or perhaps a high level wizard or cleric, or
it can be a nobleman, demihuman ruler, or perhaps a bandit chieftain. The
reason for this vendetta should be defined by the DM, and can go back even to
before the character?s birth?a family feud, for example, or a need to remove the
last heir to a line.

Whatever the enemy?s nature, it must be powerful and pervasive enough to
affect the character wherever he goes in the campaign. While this does not mean that
the PC?s life is one long chase scene, he will need to keep a wary eye over
his shoulder. The enemy will routinely send agents after the character. Also, the
enemy should have good conduits of information, being able to keep general
tabs on the PC in city, town, and perhaps even wilderness environments.
