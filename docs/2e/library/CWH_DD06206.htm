The successful casting of a spell requires intense, uninterrupted
concentration from the caster. If the caster's concentration is interrupted by an attack, a
sudden noise, or any other distraction, the spell is lost.
<P></P>
In certain situations, the caster may have trouble focusing or sustaining his
concentration. He may be suffering from an extreme headache or other illness.
He may be dizzy, fatigued, or otherwise disoriented. Or he may have had a little
too much wine and is feeling the after-effects. In such cases, the DM can rule
that the wizard is unable to cast spells as effectively as he normally would.
In extreme cases-- for instance, if the wizard's headache is so severe that he
is unable to stand or open his eyes-- the DM might rule that the wizard is
completely unable to cast spells until his condition improves.
<P></P>
In less extreme cases, the DM can require the wizard to make a successful
Intelligence Check before attempting to cast any spell to see if he can muster the
necessary degree of concentration. After the wizard announces which spell he
will attempt to cast, the player rolls 1d20. If the result is less than or equal
to the wizard's Intelligence, the spell is cast normally. If the result is
greater than the wizard's Intelligence, the spell is lost.
<P></P>
The DM might wish to add a penalty or bonus to these Intelligence Checks. For
instance, if the wizard is disoriented as a result of falling out of a tree and
landing on his head, the DM might require a -2 modifier to his Intelligence
Checks prior to casting his spells.
