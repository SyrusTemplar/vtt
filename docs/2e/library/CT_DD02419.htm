Compare these two actions: one character with a readied bow decides to fire at
an orc chieftain 40 feet away, and a second character with a readied sword
decides to run over to the orc and take a swing at him. Which action is resolved
first? Obviously, the archer’s attack will arrive before the swordsman gets his
swing. Moving takes time, especially in a 10–15 second combat round.
<P></P>
Characters don’t instantaneously blink across a battlefield just because it’s
their turn to move. They begin their move at one point in time and then finish
moving sometime later. A character who begins his move when fast actions are
resolved may finish his move while average or slow actions are resolved.
<P></P>
Movement always begins in a character’s base initiative phase and is performed
in half-move increments, one phase at a time. For a half-move action, the
total amount of movement takes place in a single phase. For a full-move action, the
character moves no more than half of his total movement in each of two
consecutive phases, so a sprinting character is actually travelling 1.5 times his full
normal movement in each of his two movement phases. After any movement is
completed for the character, the rest of the combat action is resolved. Note that
an action may be delayed by movement, but it will never occur sooner than normal
because of movement. In other words, if a fast character with a two-handed
sword (a slow weapon) chooses to make a half-move and attack, the half-move occurs
in the fast phase, but the attack does not happen until the slow phase (unless
the character was <A HREF="DD02427.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02427.htm">charging</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">; see below).
<P></P>
Note that when several allies (characters or creatures that all won or lost
initiative together) are acting in the same phase, characters performing actions
do so before their companions begin to move.

<I> For example, Boldo the swordsman intends to take a half-move and attack an
orc, while his companion, Fletcher the bowman, prepares to fire an arrow at it. If
Boldo’s half-move and Fletcher’s shot both occur in the same phase, the arrow
actually streaks toward the orc before the swordsman lunges forward to close
with it.

Also note that the 1-square adjustment of a no-move action is considered
simultaneous with the action itself. Thus, the adjustment and the no-move action all
occur before any normal movement is performed by allies who are eligible to do
so during the same phase.
