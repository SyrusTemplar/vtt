The priest's god or the rules of the priestly order might force the priest to
undertake some actions that the local authorities just don't understand or
approve of. (See below, under &quot;<A HREF="DD05652.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD05652.htm">Society's Punishments</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">,&quot; for more on this.) If the priesthood is not protected against prosecution
by the secular (non-priestly) authorities, then the priest might find himself on
trial for any illegal action performed in the god's name.

Gods usually don't appear in court as defense witnesses. Therefore, the
priest-PC must defend himself through legal means without the benefit of divine
testimony. If he's convicted, he might have to escape jail to avoid execution; he
might even choose to accept execution in order to dramatize the injustice of
his plight. Or, the court might sentence him to some suicidal mission to atone
for the crime he committed. He isn't required by the court to go on the mission
alone, but no NPC adventurers want to march with him into certain doom. Thus the
priest character is again brought into an adventure because of his faith, and
his friends the other PCs, if they truly are his friends, will accompany him on
this quest.
