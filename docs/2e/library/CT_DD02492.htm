Some weapons, such as the sai or the swordbreaker, are suited for breaking a
trapped enemy weapon. When a weapon of this type is used to trap an enemy
weapon, the trapping character can declare an attempt to break the weapon. The
trapped character must roll a successful item saving throw vs. crushing blow for his
weapon or it breaks; for metal weapons, this is a 7 or better on 1d20. The
weapon?s magical bonus applies.
<P></P>
If the break attempt fails, the trapped blade is automatically freed.
Otherwise, the weapon is broken. Only swords, knives, or weapons with sword-like
components (such as a halberd?s spike or a glaive) can be broken.
