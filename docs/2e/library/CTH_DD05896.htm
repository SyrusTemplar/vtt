Because the ruler(s) of the guild are of such major importance, many DMs will
be prepared to put some extra effort into designing them in some detail. For
those who don't want to have to go to the trouble, the blueprint profiles (later
in this chapter) can be used for guildmasters. For the more industrious, why
settle for the usual option of (say) a human or half-elf guildmaster with the
usual high skills and appropriate magic items, or the sourpuss old dwarf with his
smelly leather armor who is the secret behind-the-scenes master thief? Guild
design does include such natural racial possibilities, but there are other, more
exotic, options.
<P></P>
The DM will always want to design these cases individually, but a few examples
won't go amiss-these can be ripped off with or without DM development, or used
as a spur to DM imagination.
<P></P>
<I> Dragon:</I> A dragon makes an excellent guildmaster. Some can<I> polymorph self</I> into human (half-elf, etc.) form as a natural ability, others can use the
spell of the same name, others still might have a magical item permitting this
change of appearance. Dragons are vain and love treasure, so what more natural
than a stream of junior thieves bringing pretty treasures to the &quot;guildmaster&quot; as
a tithe? The guildmaster can also, of course, have many charmed servants from <I>charm person</I> spells.
<P></P>
<I> Deepearth Creature:</I> Drow and Illithid are the best candidates. Appearance can be disguised with
an illusion spell, the use of a mask (imagine cowled, masked thieves protecting
their identities in a council meeting-a very sensible set of precautions), a <I>hat of disguise</I>, or in other ways. The guildmaster could aim at gaining wealth, power,
information, all for nefarious purposes which PCs should want to stop. Combatting
such a guildmaster (or even a ruling council) is an excellent introduction to
deepearthing, a pleasure no player should be denied.
<P></P>
<I>Extraplanar Creature:</I> Denizens from evil planes make excellent guildmasters. They like having
power, gaining information, and wealth isn't something they are wholly indifferent
to. Plus they have lots of time on their hands to indulge themselves by being a
thieves' guildmaster. Their powers of disguise and concealment make it easy to
maintain the pretense of humanoid form.
<P></P>
<I>Intelligent Monster:</I> A troll as guildmaster is not terribly likely. But how about a beholder?
efreet? rakshasa (a particularly good choice)? a faerie dragon using its many
spells? There are many possibilities!
<P></P>
If the DM decides on a special guild ruler, there are several questions which
he needs to consider:
<P></P>
<P></P>
* Can the ruler pass itself off as a normal race? This will usually be
important for retaining the loyalties of guildmembers. A spell, magical item, innate
power, or plausible reason for seclusion will be needed.
<P></P>
* How did the creature get to the top? Either it must have thief skills, or be
able to simulate these (with spells, magical items such as<I> gauntlets of dexterity,</I> etc.), if it has worked its way up through the ranks. Or, it must have been
able to replace someone at the top of the guild (through assassination, etc.).
<P></P>
* Why does this creature want to be guildmaster? The possible reasons are
money (tithes), information (thief spy reports), power, amusing itself (a faerie
dragon, or an evil denizen with a few decades to kill), and the like.
<P></P>
If the DM is prepared to think through such issues, then a special ruler type
can be great fun.
