</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The six character abilities are described below. Each description gives an
idea of what that ability encompasses. Specific game effects are also given. At
the end of each ability description is the table giving all modifiers and game
information for each ability score. The blue-shaded ability scores can be
obtained only by extraordinary means, whether by good fortune (finding a magical book
that raises a score) or ill fortune (an attack by a creature that lowers a
score).
