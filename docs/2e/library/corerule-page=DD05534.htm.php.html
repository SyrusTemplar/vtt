<P></P>
This god's interest is in the safe and successful birthing of children and,
subsequently, their protection and nurturing.
<P></P>
His priests take those interests to heart, and, because of the god's
protective aspects, tend to learn fairly powerful combat magics.
<P></P>
One lesser god of this attribute would be the god of Youth, representing
children and youths of all ages from birth to the verge of adulthood.
<P></P>
Gods of birth, children, and youth tend to be female.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Ancestors,
Community, Fertility, Healing, Love, Marriage, and Race. The priests of this god
dislike the priests of Death, Disease.
