<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Book of Infinite Spells:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This magical work bestows upon any character of any class the ability to use
the spells within its pages. However, upon first reading the work, any character
not already able to use spells suffers 5d4 points of damage and is stunned for
5d4 turns. Thereafter, he can examine the writing without further harm. The <I>book of infinite spells</I> contains d8 + 22 pages. The nature of each page is determined by random die
roll. Make a percentile roll and consult the following table:

If a spell is written on a page, determine the spell level by rolling 1d10 for
a priest spell and 1d12 for a wizard spell. If the result is 8-10 (for priest)
or 10-12 (for wizard) make a second die roll—1d6 for priests, 1d8 for wizard
spells. Once the spell level is known, the DM can select particular spells or
determine them randomly. Record page contents secretly, and <I>do not reveal this information to the holder of the book.</I>
<P></P>
Once a page is turned it can never be flipped back—paging through a <I>book of infinite spells</I> is a one-way trip. When the last page is turned, the book vanishes. The owner
of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened, once per day only.
(If the spell is one that the character would normally be able to cast by
reason of class and level, however, the spell can be cast up to four times per day
due to the book's magical powers.)
<P></P>
The owner of the book need not have the book on his person in order to use its
power. The book can be stored in a place of safety while the owner is
adventuring and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of its power.
<P></P>
Each time a spell is cast there is a chance that the energy connected with its
use will cause the page to magically turn (despite all precautions). The owner
will know this and possibly even benefit from the turning by gaining access to
a new spell. The chance of a page turning is as follows:
