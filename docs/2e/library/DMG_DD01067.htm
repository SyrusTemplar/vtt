<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Vacuous Grimoire:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A book of this sort is identical to a normal one, although if a <I>detect magic</I> spell is cast, a magical aura will be noted. Any character who opens the work
and reads so much as a single glyph therein must make two saving throws vs.
spell. The first is to determine if one point of Intelligence is lost or not; the
second is to find if two points of Wisdom are lost. Once opened and read, the <I>vacuous grimoire</I> remains; to be destroyed, the book must be burned and a <I>remove curse</I> spell cast. If the tome is placed with other books, its appearance will
instantly alter to conform to the look of these other works.
