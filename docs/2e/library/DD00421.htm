To make a called shot, a player must announce his intention before any
initiative dice are rolled. Upon doing so, he suffers a +1 penalty to his initiative
(representing the time spent carefully aiming his attack).
<P></P>
When the character does get a chance to act, his attack roll suffers a -4
penalty. If the roll succeeds, the called shot accomplishes what the player wanted;
if the roll missed, no damage occurs.
<P></P>
Because the AD&amp;D game uses a generalized system for damage, called shots
cannot be used to accomplish certain things. Against a creature, a called shot will
only cause the normal amount of damage allowed the weapon. Attempts to blind,
cripple, or maim will not succeed. So what can it do?
<P></P>
A called shot can cause a target to drop items or react in some other, more
subtle, way. It can penetrate weak points in armor. It also can be used in
attempts to knock an object out of a hand, shatter a flask, or otherwise damage
items. Called shots can be very useful in activating the trigger of a known trap (if
this can be done with a weapon) or in impressing the locals in an archery
contest.
