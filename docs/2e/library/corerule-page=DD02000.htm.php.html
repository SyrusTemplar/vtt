By means of this spell, the wizard summons up a phantom watchdog that only he
can see. He may then command it to perform as guardian of a passage, room,
door, or similar space or portal. The phantom watchdog immediately commences a loud
barking if any creature larger than a cat approaches the place it guards. As
the faithful hound is able to detect invisible creatures and ward against the
approach of ethereal creatures, it is an excellent guardian. It does not react to
illusions that are not at least quasi-real.
<P></P>
If the intruding creature exposes its back to the watchdog, the dog delivers a
vicious attack as if it were a 10-Hit Dice monster, striking for 3d6 points of
damage. It is able to hit opponents of all types, even those normally subject
only to magical weapons of +3 or greater. Creatures without backs (for example,
ochre jellies) are not attacked. The faithful hound cannot be attacked, but it
can be dispelled. The spell lasts for a maximum of one hour plus half an hour
per caster level, but once it is activated by an intruder, it lasts only one
round per caster level. If the spellcaster is ever more than 30 yards distant
from the area that the watchdog guards, the spell ends.
<P></P>
The material components of this spell are a tiny silver whistle, a piece of
bone, and a thread.
