This spell creates a billowy cloud of magical vapors that moves in the
direction of the prevailing wind at a rate of 20 feet per round. A strong wind
(greater than 15 miles per hour) breaks it up in 4 rounds, and a greater wind (25 MPH
or more) prevents the use of the spell. Thick vegetation disperses the cloud in
2 rounds.
<P></P>
The <I>cloud of purification</I> transmutes organic filth, garbage, and vermin (mice, rats, rot grubs, and so
on) into an equal quantity of pure water. For example, a nest of rot grubs
caught in the cloud would &quot;melt,&quot; becoming small puddles of clean water. If the
spell is cast over a body of water, the cloud merges with a portion of the water
equal to its own size, transmuting any filth, microbes, small fish, or other
&quot;impurities&quot; into clean water.
<P></P>
The cloud's vapors are heavier than air, so they sink to the lowest level of
the land (even down holes in the ground). Thus, this spell is perfect for
cleansing a sewer or well.
<P></P>
This spell in no way affects magical creatures or creatures larger than a
normal rat.
