<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
?? The most important elements of a paladin's ethos are his <I>strictures</I>, a set of inviolable rules from the <I>PH</I> that the paladin must follow at all times. The paladin's strictures are as
inflexible as his ability requirements; they are part of what defines a character
as a paladin and distinguishes him from other classes.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Lawful Good Alignment</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
?? Every paladin must be lawful good. The moment he abandons the conditions of
this alignment is the moment he stops being a paladin.
<P></P>
?? At the heart of a lawful good alignment is the belief in a system of laws that
promotes the welfare of all members of a society, ensures their safety, and
guarantees justice. So long as the laws are just and applied fairly to all
people, it doesn't matter to the paladin whether they originate from a democracy or a
dictator.
<P></P>
?? Though all lawful good systems adhere to the same general principles, specific
laws may be different. One society may allow a wife to have two husbands,
another may enforce strict monogamy. Gambling may be tolerated in one system,
forbidden in another. A paladin respects the laws of other lawful good cultures and
will not seek to impose his own values on their citizens.
<P></P>
?? However, a paladin will not honor a law that runs contrary to his alignment. A
government may believe that unregulated gambling provides a harmless
diversion, but a paladin may determine that the policy has resulted in devastating
poverty and despair. In the paladin's mind, the government is guilty of a lawless
act by promoting an exploitative and destructive enterprise. In response, the
paladin may encourage citizens to refrain from gambling, or he may work to change
the law.
<P></P>
?? Particularly abhorrent practices, such as slavery and torture, may force the
paladin to take direct action. It doesn't matter if these practices are
culturally acceptable or sanctioned by well-meaning officials. The paladin's sense of
justice compels him to intervene and alleviate as much suffering as he can.
Note, though, that time constraints, inadequate resources, and other commitments
may limit his involvement. While a paladin might wish for a cultural revolution
in a society that tolerates cannibalism, he may have to content himself with
rescuing a few victims before circumstances force him to leave the area.
<P></P>
?? When will a paladin take a life? A paladin kills whenever necessary to promote
the greater good, or to protect himself, his companions, or anyone whom he's
vowed to defend. In times of war, he strikes down the enemies of his ruler or
church. He does not interfere with a legal execution, so long as the punishment
fits the crime.
<P></P>
?? Otherwise, a paladin avoids killing whenever possible. He does not kill a
person who is merely suspected of a crime, nor does a paladin necessarily kill
someone he perceives to be a threat unless he has tangible evidence or certain
knowledge of evildoing. He never kills for treasure or personal gain. He never
knowingly kills a lawful good being.
<P></P>
?? Though paladins believe in the sanctity of innocent life, most kill animals
and other nonaligned creatures in certain situations. A paladin may kill animals
for food. He will kill a monster that endangers humans, even if the monster is
motivated by instinct, not evil. While some paladins avoid hunting for sport,
others may hunt to sharpen their combat and tracking skills.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Magical Item Limit
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
?? The paladin's limited access to spells also extends to the number of magical
items he may possess. Under no circumstances may a paladin retain more than 10
magical items, regardless of his level, kit, or status.
<P></P>
?? Paladins are limited not only to the number of magical items, but also the
type. Specifically, a paladin can have the following:
<P></P>
?? <B>One suit of magical armor.</B> This excludes all pieces of normal armor that have been temporarily
enchanted, as well as accessories such as a <I>cloak of protection</I>,<I> a helm of protection</I>,<I> </I>or<I> boots of speed</I> (all of which count against the paladin's miscellaneous item limit). A single
piece of magical armor, such a chest plate, counts as a full suit for
limitation purposes.
<P></P>
?? <B>One magical shield.
<P></P>
?? Four magical weapons.</B> This excludes all normal weapons temporarily affected by <I>enchanted weapon</I> or similar spells, but includes <I>holy swords</I>. A quiver or case of arrows or bolts counts as one item. Individual arrows
and bolts are counted as one item if they have special magical properties, such
as <I>arrows of direction</I> and <I>arrows of slaying</I>.
<P></P>
?? <B>Four miscellaneous magical items.</B> This category includes rings, rods, staves, gems, and scrolls. A <I>bag of beans</I>, a set of<I> ioun stones</I>, and a<I> deck of many things</I> each count as one item. A magical potion counts as one item, regardless of
the number of doses. Items temporarily enchanted by spells are excluded.
<P></P>
?? To ensure that a paladin stays within his limit, it's important to clarify who
owns each of the party's magical items. In general, a paladin won't use a
magical item unless it's his. It doesn't matter who actually carries the item; if a
paladin has claimed ownership, it belongs to him. A paladin may loan items to
his companions, but so long as he retains ownership, loaned items count against
his limit.
<P></P>
?? Conversely, if a paladin has 10 items, he won't borrow items from other
characters. A paladin won't look for ambiguities to exploit; he remains true to the
spirit as well as the letter of these rules.
<P></P>
?? Of course, a paladin may not know that an item is magical when he acquires it.
But as soon as he becomes aware of its special properties, he's obligated to
give it away or to get rid of another item to remain within his limit.
<P></P>
?? A paladin may voluntarily rid himself of a magical item if he finds a more
desirable one. For instance, he may give up an<I> arrow of direction</I> if he discovers a <I>javelin of lightning</I>.
<P></P>
?? Excess magical items may be given to other lawful good characters, donated to
the paladin's religious institution, or simply discarded. Since excess items
technically don't belong to the paladin (he won't claim ownership), they may not
be sold or traded, even if the paladin intends to funnel the profits to a
worthy cause.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Wealth Limits
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
?? A paladin has no interest in wealth for its own sake. He seeks spiritual
rather than material satisfaction, derived from serving his faith and his government
to the best of his ability. To a paladin, the pleasures of ownership are
fleeting, superficial, and ultimately debasing. The rewards of duty are lasting and
deep.
<P></P>
?? Still, the paladin realizes that a certain amount of money is necessary to
survive. Rather than forego money altogether, he retains enough wealth to meet his
worldly obligations and sustain a modest lifestyle.
<P></P>
?? A paladin doesn't expect handouts, nor does he rely on the generosity of
strangers or his companions. He feels responsible to pay his own way and takes pride
in his self-sufficiency. He earns income from treasure, rewards, and fees, the
same as anyone else. Unlike most other characters, however, the paladin
operates under strict guidelines as to how he can spend his money and how much he can
save.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Budgeting
<P></P>
</B>?? A paladin requires funds to cover the following expenses:
<P></P>
?<B>? Food.</B> A paladin is responsible for feeding himself and his steed. To hold down
costs, the paladin might hunt his own game, and may gather fruits, nuts and
vegetables from the wilderness.
<P></P>
<B>?? Weapons, armor, and clothing.</B> This includes the costs of purchase, upkeep, repair, and replacement. A
paladin seldom skimps in this area, spending as much as his funds will allow to
secure the highest-quality equipment.
<P></P>
?<B>? Tack and harness.</B> As with weapons and armor, many paladins splurge to buy the best, especially
for bonded mounts.
<P></P>
?<B>? Lodging.</B> When sleeping outdoors isn't practical, paladins seek out the least expensive
inns.
<P></P>
?? <B>Taxes and licenses.</B> The paladin must make all payments required by his liege. He must also pay
all foreign tolls and fees levied during his travels.
<P></P>
?<B>? Training costs.</B> A paladin may pay a tutor for training, providing the tutor is of lawful good
alignment and the paladin has permission from his patron. (See <A HREF="DD05427.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD05427.htm">Chapter 7</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> for more about training procedures.)
<P></P>
<B>?? Miscellaneous provisions. </B>Including medicines, lantern oil, clothing, bedding, and grooming supplies.
Many paladins prefer to forage, improvise, or manufacture these items instead of
buying them outright, in order to save money.
<P></P>
?? <B>Salaries.</B> Fair salaries are required for all servitors and henchmen.
<P></P>
<B>?? Stronghold expenses.</B> A paladin pays all costs associated with the construction and maintenance of
his stronghold.
<P></P>
<B>Strongholds
<P></P>
</B>?? In addition to his contingency fund, a paladin may also maintain a separate
fund to save for a stronghold. As explained in Chapter 7, construction prices
vary wildly, though all are expensive. A paladin may have to save for years, even
decades, to accumulate enough wealth to build a stronghold. A wise paladin,
then, begins his stronghold fund as soon as possible; 1st level isn't too early to
start saving.
<P></P>
?? Once a paladin establishes a stronghold, he acquires a universe of new
expenses, particularly those involving personnel and maintenance. The paladin must
adjust his monthly budget accordingly. He may also wish to build up his
contingency fund to cover two or three months' worth of overhead.
<P></P>
?? An established stronghold typically falls into one of three economic
categories, each of which has a particular impact on the paladin's finances:
<P></P>
<I>?? Subsidized</I>. The stronghold has no significant agricultural or manufacturing base. Any
crops or goods produced at the stronghold are insufficient to pay the
stronghold's maintenance costs and employees. The paladin must make up the difference out
of his own pocket, which raises his monthly financial obligations dramatically.
<P></P>
?? It's not unusual for a paladin to subsidize a new stronghold until it gets up
and running. With careful management and a little luck, a stronghold becomes
self-sustaining within a few months or, at most, a few years. Some paladins,
however, subsidize their strongholds indefinitely, usually for one of two reasons:
<P></P>
? The stronghold was never designed to generate income, functioning instead as
a military stronghold, training center, hospital, or religious sanctuary. Such a stronghold requires the commitment of
a paladin with considerable resources.
<P></P>
? The stronghold was designed to generate income, but due to misfortune or
incompetent management, never succeeded. Should the paladin decide to cut his losses and abandon the stronghold, he
must first see to the well-being of his faithful employees, giving them adequate
severance pay and doing what he can to find them new jobs.
<P></P>
?? <I>Self-sustaining</I>. The stronghold pays its own way through the sale of crops, goods, or
services. The paladin needn't subsidize the operation in any way, nor does he have to
worry about the proper disposal of excess profits (there aren't any). This is
the ideal arrangement for most paladins.
<P></P>
?? <I>Profit-making</I>. The stronghold generates regular and dependable profits from the sale of
crops, goods, or services. The paladin uses these profits to expand his holdings
(to provide jobs for more people or to further glorify his deity, never for
personal gain) or to increase his donations to his church or other worthy causes. A
profit-making stronghold usually requires extra time and attention from the
paladin, or the services of skilled managers.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Excess Funds</B>
<P></P>
?? All of a paladin's excess funds must be forfeited. This includes all money
remaining after he pays his regular expenses, as well as any money not
specifically allocated to a savings fund for building a stronghold. He may keep a
contingency fund equal to two or three times his normal monthly budget (including
maintenance costs and employee salaries for his stronghold) but no more. He may <I>not</I> stockpile money to buy gifts, leave to his heirs, or pay a friend's expenses.
<P></P>
?? What does a paladin do with the excess? He has three options:
<P></P>
? <I>Refuse it</I>. If an appreciative community offers him a sack of gems for destroying a
vampire, he politely declines. (&quot;Your gratitude is more than sufficient.&quot;) If he
discovers a treasure chest filled with pearls, gold pieces, and a book of poetry,
he takes the book and leaves the rest (and he's likely to give the book to a
friend or a library after he's finished reading it).
<P></P>
? <I>Donate it to the church</I>. This does <I>not</I> count as a regular tithing (see the Tithing section below), as it's not
considered part of his income.
<P></P>
? <I>Donate it to another worthy institution of lawful good alignment</I>. Suitable recipients include hospitals, libraries, and orphanages. Research
facilities, military organizations, and governmental operations are acceptable
only if the paladin is certain that the money will be spent on lawful good
projects.
<P></P>
?? Within these guidelines, a paladin may dispose of his excess funds as he
wishes. He may donate treasure to a hospital on one occasion, and refuse a monetary
reward for rescuing a kidnapped prince on another. However, he may <I>never</I> give his excess funds to another player character, or to any nonplayer
character or creature controlled by a player.
<P></P>
?? Remember, too, that just because a paladin declines a reward for rescuing a
prince doesn't mean his fellow party members can't accept it. If a paladin kills
an evil dragon, then walks away from its treasure hoard, his companions are
still free to help themselves.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Loans</B>
<P></P>
?? A paladin falling on hard times or confronted with unanticipated expenses may
arrange for a loan from a lawful good character or institution. While borrowing
money may be a humiliating experience, it's rarely an ethos violation unless
the paladin borrows money he doesn't need or doesn't intend to repay.
<P></P>
?? In general, a paladin may borrow only small amounts of money (say, an amount
equivalent to his monthly budget). He may also borrow the minimum amount
required for an emergency; an opportunity to buy a treasure map leading to a <I>holy sword</I> doesn't qualify, but medicine to treat a dying companion might. Borrowing
money to pay the monthly operating expenses of a stronghold is allowed, but only
if necessary to keep lawful good workers employed or to make vital repairs. (A
leaking roof can wait; a crumbled wall probably can't.) A paladin should strive
to repay his debts as quickly as possible.
<P></P>
?? Repeated borrowing is discouraged, and chronic debt should be considered an
ethos violation. If a paladin borrows money for several consecutive months, he
might lose his stronghold, his bonded mount, or any other obligation that's
costing him more than he can afford.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Tithing
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
?? A paladin must give 10% of all his income to a lawful good institution. This
10% is called a <I>tithe</I>. In most cases, a paladin tithes to his church or other religious
organization. If he doesn't belong to a church or operates independently (as in the case
of the Expatriate character kit described in Chapter 4), he may designate any
lawful good organization, such as a hospital or university, as the recipient of
his tithes. A paladin has no say in how his tithes are spent, though the money
typically goes towards the institution's maintenance, recruitment, equipment,
and education costs. A paladin usually tithes to the same institution for his
entire career.
<P></P>
?? A paladin's first tithe usually comes out of his starting funds of 5d4 x 10
gp. After that, he must tithe from all sources of income, including rewards,
treasure, wages, and profits generated from his stronghold. When he acquires a gem
or magical item, he owes his designated institution 10% of the item's value (as
determined by the DM), payable at the earliest opportunity. If he finds a
diamond worth 500 gp, he owes 50 gp; if the gem is lost or stolen, he still owes 50
gp (the institution isn't penalized for the paladin's carelessness).
<P></P>
?? Tithes are due only on funds the paladin actually claims for himself. If he
walks away from a treasure or refuses a reward, no tithes are necessary.
<P></P>
?? It's the paladin's responsibility to get his tithes to his institution as soon
as possible. A monthly payment will suffice in most cases, with the paladin
turning in 10% of all the income he's acquired in the previous four weeks. If a
monthly payment is impossible or impractical?for instance, if the paladin is on
a mission halfway around the world, or if he's a prisoner of war?he may make
other arrangements, providing he offers a satisfactory explanation. A paladin may
personally present his tithings to his institution or he may deliver them by
messenger.
<P></P>
?? Tithes carried by the paladin but not yet delivered are still considered to be
the property of the institution. A starving paladin who has no other funds
aside from 10 gp of tithes may <I>not</I> spend his tithes on food, unless he first petitions his deity for permission.
If he's behaved responsibly?say, if he used his last gold piece to pay for
treatment of a dying child?permission is usually granted, with the understanding
that the tithes must be replaced.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Alignment of Associates</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
?? A paladin is known by the company he keeps. Ideally, a paladin associates only
with good-aligned companions. Relationships with neutral characters may be
tolerated in limited circumstances, but prolonged contact may result in an ethos
violation. <I>Any</I> association with an evil-aligned character can be construed as an evil act.
In general, a paladin bears responsibility for the actions of his associates,
even those taken without his knowledge or consent.
<P></P>
?? <B>Hirelings.</B> Without exception, all of a paladin's men-at-arms and stronghold employees
must be lawful good. The paladin should do his best to determine their alignment
before he hires them. Should a hireling commit an evil act or otherwise reveal
himself to be of an alignment other than lawful good, the paladin has no
recourse but to fire him and, if necessary, turn him over to the proper authorities
for prosecution.
<P></P>
?? In some cases, a paladin shares responsibility for the evil actions of his
hirelings. For instance, a paladin's stable master commits murder. The paladin may
not be legally liable, but he may be considered an accomplice in an ethical
sense. Although the authorities may not prosecute the paladin, he may still
suffer a punishment for violating his ethos, particularly if he was remiss in
investigating the stable master's background prior to his employment. As always, it's
up to the DM to determine if an ethos violation has been committed.
<P></P>
?? <B>Henchmen. </B>A paladin accepts only lawful good characters as henchmen. As with a hireling,
the paladin should make every effort to determine a potential henchman's
alignment before an alliance develops. The paladin must immediately dismiss a
henchman who commits an evil act.
<P></P>
?? <B>Good characters.</B> In an adventuring party, a paladin naturally gravitates to other lawful good
player characters, making them his confidants and closest companions. Rarely,
however, can a paladin choose the composition of his party, as fate often throws
together characters of vastly different outlooks. A paladin cooperates with a
party so long as the majority of the characters are good-aligned; a majority of
neutral characters or the presence of even a single evil character may present
problems.
<P></P>
?? A paladin can maintain a comfortable partnership with a neutral good
characters, despite his reservations about the neutral good character's indifference to
social structures. However, the neutral good character must be working strictly
in the interests of good. A paladin is less at ease with chaotic good
characters, owing to their independent nature and lack of respect for authority. But a
paladin will work with chaotic good characters so long as their behavior
complies with his goals.
<P></P>
<B>?? Neutral characters.</B> Next to good characters, some paladins feel most comfortable with lawful
neutral characters, admiring them for their sense of duty and loyalty to their
government. This, of course, presumes the lawful neutral characters serve
reasonably benevolent governments, not despots or slave traders.
<P></P>
?? A paladin will cooperate with a party that contains a minority of lawful
neutral or true neutral characters. But he most likely keeps neutral characters at
arm's length, resisting their gestures of friendship. Instead, he tries to serve
as an example to the neutral characters, hoping to convince them through words
and deeds that a commitment to good results in a richer, fuller life. So long
as neutral characters refrain from committing evil acts, a paladin continues to
work with them.
<P></P>
?? A paladin won't join a party consisting entirely of neutral characters, unless
the stakes are exceptionally high. He may, for instance, work with a neutral
party to retrieve a holy artifact, rescue his king, or save his church from
destruction. For less momentous undertakings, such as treasure hunts or
reconnaissance expeditions, the paladin should excuse himself. (If a party mostly consists
of neutral PCs, the DM should explain the general nature of a new adventure to
a player with a paladin PC. The player should have the option of gracefully
bowing out of the adventure or choosing another character.)
<P></P>
<B>?? Evil characters.</B> Because he is duty-bound to suppress evil, a paladin won't tolerate an evil
PC. He may take the evil PC into custody, physically restrain him, or demand his
expulsion from the party. If all else fails, the paladin severs his ties with
the party and go his own way. In any event, inaction is unacceptable.
<P></P>
?? A paladin finds it difficult, if not impossible, to avoid contact with evil
NPCs. They're everywhere: walking down a street, dining at an inn, shopping at a
bazaar. A paladin's ethos doesn't compel him to attack or even confront all
evil NPCs; in many cases, hostile confrontations could be counterproductive,
particularly if such an action distracts the paladin from a more important mission,
or if it triggers retaliation from the NPC's companions against innocent
bystanders.
<P></P>
?? Time and circumstances permitting, a paladin may question evil NPCs, follow
them, or make inquiries about them. None of these actions violate a paladin's
ethos when used in moderation. (However, spying and similar actions should be a
last resort, because they connote deception). A paladin walks on shaky ground,
however, the moment he begins an association with an evil NPC that could be
perceived as friendly or compliant.
