Making the Switch</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">

Adding spells, magical items, or the critical hit rules to an existing
campaign is fairly easy, but a DM may have trouble with some other material in this
book. In particular, existing spellcasters may wish to take advantage of new
class abilities or optional specializations that weren’t available when the
character was first created. There are several ways to handle this. First, there’s no
reason that a DM couldn’t allow a player to “re-design” his character,
incorporating the abilities he thinks his character should have had all along. If a PC
cleric comes from a savage tribe and portrays himself as a barbarian, it’s
perfectly reasonable to allow him to rebuild his character as a shaman (see <A HREF="DD03419.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03419.htm">Chapter 2</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> ) and continue play. If the player is altering his character without any good
rationale or explanation for why he’s making the change, the DM can require
the character to pay a penalty of 10% to 50% of his experience point total,
depending on the DM’s assessment of the scope of the alterations.

There are a couple of things a player should <I>not</I> be able to do by redesigning his character. A character shouldn’t change
specializations without a very good justification, so a necromancer shouldn’t be
rebuilt as an enchanter or wild mage, and a specialty priest of Lathander
shouldn’t become a priest of Helm. A character’s basic ability scores, equipment,
proficiencies, hit points, and general personality shouldn’t change. If a player
was playing a barbarian cleric correctly, he was probably choosing skills and
weapons appropriate for a shaman—and if he wasn’t selecting these skills, the
reasoning behind the switch becomes much more suspect. Finally, a character
shouldn’t actually change classes or become dual-classed or multi-classed.

described in <A HREF="DD03506.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03506.htm">Chapter 6</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> . Try running a brief “trial adventure” using the rules before incorporating
them into your campaign. The spell point rules provide spellcasters with a lot
more flexibility than the standard magic system without increasing their raw
combat or spell power, but if PCs are allowed to make use of spell points, NPCs
and monsters should be able to as well.
