Tournaments may be fought with blunted lances. Blunted lances work just as
normal lances, but they do damage like Punching damage (i.e., 75% of all damage is
temporary, and wears off after the end of the match). Blunted lances do not
have metal or pointed heads; they weigh as much as regular lances, but cost only
half as much.
