When this spell is cast, the priest's body shudders and glows with a
shimmering aura as it becomes a vessel for the power of his god. As a result, the caster
may choose to increase one ability score (only Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, and Charisma are eligible) by +1 per three levels of his experience (+1 at
3rd level, +2 at 6th, etc.).
<P></P>
Only one attribute may be increased. The effect lasts for the duration of the
spell. Attributes may be increased above the normal restrictions due to race
and class, to a maximum of +6. All benefits for exceptional attributes listed in
the <A HREF="PHB_DD01425.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01425.htm">Player's Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> apply; however, the divine abilities found in the <I>Legends &amp; Lore</I> book cannot be gained by use of this spell.
<P></P>
For example, an 18th-level priest with Strength 15 could increase his Strength
to 21 for 18 rounds, granting him a +4 attack bonus, a +9 damage adjustment,
etc.
<P></P>
When the spell ends, the energy abruptly leaves the priest's body, leaving him
physically and mentally drained. He is nearly comatose and can do nothing but
rest for the next 4d6 turns. A successful Constitution check (at the priest's
normal attribute score) reduces this time by 50%.
<P></P>
The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a vial of holy water
that has been blessed by the high priest of the character's faith.
