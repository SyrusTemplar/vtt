By casting this spell, the wizard creates a powerful magic in some specially
prepared object--a statuette, a jeweled rod, a gem, etc. This object radiates
magic, for it contains the power to instantaneously transport its possessor to
the abode of the wizard who created it. Once the item is enchanted, the wizard
must give it willingly to an individual, at the same time informing him of a
command word to be spoken when the item is to be used. To make use of the item, the
recipient must speak the command word at the same time that he rends or breaks
the item. When this is done, the individual and all that he is wearing and
carrying are instantly transported to the abode of the wizard. No other creatures
can be affected.
<P></P>
The reversed application of the spell transports the wizard to the immediate
vicinity of the possessor of the enchanted item, when it is broken and the
command word spoken. The wizard will have a general idea of the location and
situation of the item possessor, but has no choice whether or not to go (making this a
rare casting indeed!).
<P></P>
The material components used include gemstones totaling not less than 5,000 gp
value (whether they are faceted gems or not is immaterial). The components can
be enchanted only once per month (usually on a night of a clear, full moon).
At that time, the object is set for the type of succor and its final destination
(either the location of the spellcasting or an area well known to the wizard).
