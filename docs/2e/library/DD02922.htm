limbs, stringy hair, and warty hides. They are usually ill-tempered beings who
enjoy violence for its own sake, indulging in all manner of cruelty to
entertain themselves. Ogres are extremely strong and hardy, but their lack of mental
prowess is the stuff of legend.

Ogres live by raiding and scavenging, taking what they want from those too
weak to defend themselves. A player character ogre is rare in the extreme—the
intelligence and character necessary to rise beyond the petty cruelties and
appetites of their kind just isn’t found in many ogres.
