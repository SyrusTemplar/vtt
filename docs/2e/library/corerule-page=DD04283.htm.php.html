This cooperative spell allows the priests to create a beneficial atmosphere
within a specified area. Companions of similar alignment to the casters will feel
fortified and encouraged while in the sanctified area. The spell can be cast
by a single priest or a group of priests.
<P></P>
After casting <I>sanctify</I>, the affected area is imbued with the deity's majesty. For followers of that
deity, the area radiates a holy aura. These followers gain a +2 bonus to saving
throws against all fear- and charm-based powers (a +2 to morale for
BATTLESYSTEMâ„¢ rules units). Persons of the same alignment as the caster but of different
faiths gain a +1 to saving throws (+1 in BATTLESYSTEM rules). The effect
applies only as long as the characters remain in the sanctified area.
<P></P>
Creatures intent on harming the priest or his followers suffer a -1 on saving
throws vs. fear and charm (-1 to morale for BATTLESYSTEM rules units) when on
sanctified ground.
<P></P>
Undead creatures within the area are easier to turn; any priest standing on
sanctified ground turns undead as if he were one level higher.
<P></P>
Although this spell can be cast by a single priest, it is most effective when
cast by several priests at once. The duration of the spell is equal to one
round per level of the caster. When several priests cast the spell, the level of
the most powerful priest is used, with two rounds added for every contributing
priest. Thus, one 8th-level and three 6th-level priests would give the spell a
duration of 14 rounds (8+2+2+2).
<P></P>
<I>Sanctify</I> is often used in conjunction with focus to protect the grounds of a temple or
encourage men defending a castle.
<P></P>
The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of dirt
from the grounds of an existing temple of the same faith.
<P></P>
The reverse of this spell, <I>defile</I>, functions in an identical manner with respect to saving throws for charm and
fear. However, priests standing on defiled ground who attempt to turn undead
do so at one level lower than their current level.
<P></P>
The material components for the reverse are the priest's holy symbol and a
handful of earth from a grave.
