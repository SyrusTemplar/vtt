<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Not everything an individual does is a matter of training, practice, and
education. Certain things, such as artistic talent or naturally keen senses, are
inherent. These inherited characteristics might be combined with skills to provide
a high level of mastery, but the talents themselves cannot be
learned?characters have them or they don?t. The greatest masters in any field of endeavor, of
course, combine a high level of natural talent with extensive training. A
combination of a trait with a high level of nonweapon proficiency can allow a
character to simulate this level of accomplishment. The greatest minstrels of the
realm, for example, possess the trait of musical ability, probably both vocal and
instrumental. Additionally, they have gained through practice and learning, a
high proficiency in playing musical instruments.
<P></P>
In the <I>Skills and Powers</I> rules, talents and other inherent abilities are represented as traits. These
traits can confer significant game advantages on a character, and can often
amplify the effects of related nonweapon proficiencies. Since they are significant
enhancements, they are also relatively difficult to acquire.
<P></P>
Character points must be spent at the time of character creation if players
want to select traits. Once a trait is assigned to a character, it is regarded as
permanent. Unlike proficiencies, traits cannot be improved as a character
develops. For the most part additional traits cannot be gained by a character who
already has been involved in adventuring (though if the judge deems it
appropriate, a rationale can be devised to explain why a character suddenly discovering
a hitherto unknown trait).
