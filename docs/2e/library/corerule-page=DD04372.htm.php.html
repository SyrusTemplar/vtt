This spell compels one or more living creatures to serve as mounts for the
caster and his companions. The spell affects up to 10 Hit Dice or levels of
creatures with Intelligence of 4 or lower. Creatures used as mounts must be of
suitable size to carry at least one rider; smaller creatures can be used as pack
animals.
<P></P>
Each intended mount receives a saving throw vs. spell. Creatures failing their
rolls become docile and obedient, allowing riders to mount them, and moving at
the speed and direction indicated by the caster.
<P></P>
To maintain the enchantment, the caster must remain within 10 yards of one of
the affected creatures, and each affected creature must remain within 10 yards
of another. The affected creatures will do nothing for the caster other than
carrying riders and gear; they will not fight (although they will fight to defend
themselves), nor will they intentionally endanger themselves. Any overtly
hostile act by the caster or a rider against any mount breaks the enchantment for
all the mounts.
<P></P>
When the enchantment ends or is broken, the creatures take no action for one
round, then behave as their natural instincts direct.
