Conditional Magic
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> In this system of priestly magic, deities grant the ability to cast spells
based on the priest?s need, not just on form or prayer. A faithful priest
following his patron power?s tenets will usually receive the spells he requests, but a
priest who strays from the path will soon find that his patron no longer
supports his actions. While the urgency of the priest?s request is a consideration,
the deity?s primary concern is whether or not the use of that particular spell
will benefit the deity?s own purposes and causes at that moment. The priest?s
spell powers will vary with the interest and support of his deity.
<P></P>
<P></P>
The following option is used for conditional magic:
<P></P>
<P></P>
Spells belonging to a minor sphere of access are more costly than spells from
a major sphere, as described earlier. Priests may request free or fixed
theurgies by meeting the normal spell point costs.
<P></P>
Many of the normal priest restrictions are still in place for priests using
conditional magic. First of all, priests must still ?memorize? any spell that he
wishes to have access to. After all, if the priest is granted the ability to
cast the spell, then he should be familiar with exactly how to go about doing so!
Secondly, while the priest can cast spells at a higher character level than
his own, he cannot use spells from spell lists above his own spell level.
<P></P>
Before a priest actually begins play using this system of magic, the player
and the DM should take some time to define <I>positive </I>and <I>negative conditions </I>for that priest?s faith. These are situations or guidelines that define the
deity?s interests and ensure that the priest only invokes his god?s power in
pursuit of the deity?s aims. Here are some examples of conditions:
<P></P>
<A NAME="ffbb8c58"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>
<P></P>
Positive Conditions</B>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The priest is engaged in combat against a traditional enemy of the god or the
faith, such as giants for a priest of Thor, or orcs for the priest of an elven
god.
<P></P>
The priest is located in a place sacred or special to the deity, such as a
mountaintop for a god of the air, or a deep forest for a druidical power.
<P></P>
The priest is engaged in a situation favorable to
<P></P>
the deity; fighting for a god of war, trading for a merchant power, committing
theft or burglary for a god of thieves, or in the open during a storm for a
storm god.
<P></P>
The priest?s spell will directly benefit another worshipper of the same deity,
such as healing a paladin of the same faith or using spells to protect
townspeople who follow the priest?s religion.
<P></P>
The spell fulfills a traditional role or guideline of the power?starting a
fire for a fire god, sowing deceit for a god of mischief, or offering advice or
guidance in the case of a god of wisdom or knowledge.
<P></P>

<P></P>
Negative Conditions
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The spell aids or supports a traditional enemy.
<P></P>
The priest is located in a place inimical or opposed to his power (a wind
priest adventuring underground, a fire priest venturing out on the ocean, etc.)
<P></P>
The priest is involved in a situation distasteful or opposed to his patron
power (a priest of chaos using his spells to restore order, a priest of healing
attempting to injure someone with his spells, a priest of battle trying to avoid
or escape from a fight).
<P></P>
The spell will directly or indirectly injure or discomfit a fellow worshipper
or the temple?s interests.
<P></P>
The priest has failed to observe one of his patron?s holy days or rites, has
violated his alignment, or has generally misrepresented his patron recently.
<P></P>
<P></P>
As an example of how these conditions might work, consider the case of a
priest of Tempus from the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. (Tempus is a chaotic
deity of battle and storms.) For his positive conditions, he selects casting
spells in battle, casting spells during a storm, and casting spells that enhance or
augment a warrior?s ability to fight, such as <I>bless, emotion</I>, and other such enchantments. For his negative conditions, he selects casting
spells outside of a fight, avoiding or fleeing a battle, and spells that aid
lawful characters. Naturally, the DM can either set up these conditions himself
or allow the player to set them
<P></P>
up and then approve the conditions.
<P></P>
Any time the priest casts a spell, the player should compare the number of
positive conditions that apply to the number of negative conditions, and consult <A HREF="DD03543.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03543.htm">Table 32</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Effects of Conditions.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Maglas, the priest of Tempus previously described, is locked in battle with an
ogre during a thunderstorm. Deciding that things aren?t going his way, he
decides to cast an </I>obscurement <I>spell to cover his escape. Since he is in battle, and the weather is
appropriate, he has two positive conditions. On the other hand, he?s getting ready to
flee, which is a negative condition. There is a net +1 positive condition, which
means that Maglas can cast the spell normally.
<P></P>
</I>
<P></P>
In this system, if a priest casts a spell, it?s still expended until he can
re-memorize it . . . but saving spell points may allow the character to find room
for an extra free theurgy. For example, if Maglas manages to save 8 spell
points by casting several spells in favorable conditions, he may now add a
1st-level free theurgy to his spell repertoire for the day.
