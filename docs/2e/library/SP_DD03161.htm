<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Ways to Spend and Save Money</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The economies of campaign worlds vary widely. At the most primitive level,
money is an unknown concept??economics? is a matter of finding someone with the
proficiency to do a certain task, and then bartering, persuading, or cajoling
him to do it.
<P></P>
In a more typical game environment, however, characters will have means of
counting their money, and an interest in acquiring as much of it as they can get
their hands on.
<P></P>
But what to do when that treasure sack gets too heavy to carry around? Of
course, a character can always convert silver to gold, and then gold to gems, as a
means of keeping his money portable. For those players who want to take a
little more practical approach to the problem, here are some suggestions:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="797e8567"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Moneylending
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> As explained under Debts, above, a character?s wealth includes those funds
owed him by other characters. Whether he wants to charge interest, a character can
keep a large sum of money in his own name by allowing someone else to use it
for awhile.
<P></P>
There are, of course, risks. Even the most trusting character will want to get
something in writing (which may entail finding a scribe or some formal
witness). Then there is the matter of the debtor?s honesty, not to mention the
misfortunes that might befall the fortune. Still, by lending his money and taking an
I.O.U in exchange, a character relieves himself of the need to cart all that
treasure around.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="313c835a"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Entrepreneurism
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The entrepreneurial spirit exists in virtually every environment where money
is a quantifiable entity. In a campaign, the entrepreneur is anybody who spends
his money on a risky venture that stands a chance of making him a greater
return than his initial investment.
<P></P>
There are several means of doing this?a player needs to decide if he wants his
character involved in the daily work of the venture, or if he wishes to give
his money to a trusted NPC and see what happens.
<P></P>
A character can offer to sponsor a talented NPC (or PC, for that matter). If
an apprentice displays a great deal of pottery skill, the sponsor might buy him
a wheel, clay, dyes, and a small shop in which to work. In return, the potter
would pay a portion of his earnings to his sponsor?either on an ongoing basis,
or until the debt and interest have been paid off.
<P></P>
Other subjects of sponsorship can include entertainers?jugglers, minstrels,
acting companies, and the like?merchants (see <A HREF="DD03161.htm#29a81089"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03161.htm#29a81089">Trading</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, below), and any character who would like to open a small shop or tavern of
his own.
<P></P>
Business opportunities also can be found in many campaign worlds. Whether a
player wants to open his own business, or pay for another character to take his
chances, money can be spent to set up shops, inns, ferry and other transport
services, and so on. Virtually any kind of service or goods in the campaign world
will require some initial investment before a PC or NPC can get started.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="cccb7960"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Charity
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Charity is not an investment in any calculated financial sense, but it can pay
big dividends to a generous player character. Anyone who makes a practice of
sharing his wealth with those less fortunate will earn a deep and lasting sense
of gratitude from those he helps. The archetype of this role, of course, is the
legendary figure of Robin Hood.
<P></P>
This gratitude can be manifest in many ways. If fortunes reverse, a
formerly-wealthy character can find that those he once aided are now willing to aid him
in return. Too, those who benefit from a PC?s charity will tend to regard their
benefactor quite protectively. They will pass along information about the plans
and intentions of the PC?s enemies, and even seek to thwart those plans by
diversion, pretended ignorance, and so forth.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="3196ac38"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Scutage
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This medieval form of debtorship represents a payment made by a knight or
other character who owes fealty to a higher lord. In lieu of joining the ruler?s
current military campaign, the character can pay a scutage fee. Often the king
will welcome a payment of gold or gemstones even more than he would the services
of one more blade. Alternately, if the PC is the ranking character, he can find
his coffers swelled by the ranks of his followers who have more important
things to do than help him slay the pesky dragon, or drive off the marauding orcs.
<P></P>
The exact terms of scutage must be negotiated. Relevant factors will include
the dangers of the contemplated campaign, the wealth of the underling, and the
need of the ruler to have help. Also, scutage may be demanded after the fact?if
the knight didn?t show up when he was expected, the king will probably come to
see him after the campaign. In this case the scutage fee will be significantly
higher than the previously negotiated settlement.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="29a81089"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Trading
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> One of the most time-honored means of making money involves taking something a
character has in plenty, and carrying it where that plentiful item is in great
demand. Ideally, the character then gathers some cargo that will draw high
prices when he returns home. Trading missions can occur over land or water.
<P></P>
A character may contribute money to a sea captain who?s planning to carry a
load of local wool, wine, and dye across a small sea. On the far shore, the
seaman will barter for spices, silk, and steel. When he returns and sells those
goods locally, all the investors will ideally receive their share of the profits.
<P></P>
The trials and tribulations faced by such traveling merchants are too numerous
to count. Ships sink, sandstorms scatter desert caravans, and bandits prey on
weakly-defended parties.
<P></P>
Trading expeditions can make splendid adventures, if the players are
interested in sending their characters on such a trek. Alternately, a wealthy PC can put
his funds at the disposal of a reputable sea captain or merchant and see what
kind of profits or losses result. The DM will need to adjudicate these
attempts, factoring in distance traveled, risks of weather, terrain and banditry, and
the relative worth of the goods in their points of departure and arrival.
<P></P>
For example, a character gathers the funds to purchase 100 mules, 100 pack
saddles, and 400 bolts of fine wool. His journey will take him over a mountain
range and through a forest known to contain goblins. If the PCs accompany the
caravan, the DM could present attacks by griffons in the heights, several harassing
attacks by goblins, one major ambush, and a challenging river crossing. Each
of these might cost the caravan one or more mules, and several loads might be
lost in the river even if the mules make it across. When the caravan reaches its
destination, the characters can also role-play the bartering of the wool for
other goods or treasure. In the end, the profit or loss of the mission will be a
matter of gaming adventure.
<P></P>
Alternately, the character might fund a group of NPCs to perform this mission.
The DM will then judge the risks and losses of the mission, as well as the
honesty of the NPCs. After a suitable period of game time has passed, those NPCs
will (hopefully) show up at the PC?s home base to give him his profits.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Gronyard, a mighty warrior, returns from an extended adventure during which he
<P></P>
rescues the daughter of the king from an evil dragon, slays the dragon, and
acquires some 12,000 gold pieces worth of treasure?gems, coins, and a precious
artifact, a comb of gold, studded with diamonds.
<P></P>
Upon his return to civilization, Gronyard is made a baron by the king, who is
tremendously grateful that his daughter was spared. The title includes a large
house that is in need of some repair, but does not include ownership of any
significant lands.
<P></P>
Up to this point, Gronyard can cash in some of his treasure for character
points?4,000 gp for each point. However, he decides not to do this. Instead, he
invests 2,000 to fix up the house, and another 5,000 to buy a large swath of prime
farmland. He decides to keep the golden comb (worth about 3,000) as his
portable treasure, which leaves him another 2,000 gp as spendable assets.
<P></P>
With that money he invests in a caravan of goods which can travel through the
newly opened mountain pass (now that Gronyard has slain the dragon that used to
block the way.)
<P></P>
If Gronyard now decides to buy a character point, the cost will still be 4,000
gp because he can?t divest himself of liquid assets just before making this
trade.
<P></P>
Gronyard also has some intangible wealth, in that the king is still going to
be grateful for his daughter?s life. If Gronyard needs a hand, chances are that
the king will remember this debt. On the other hand, the king will also
remember Gronyard as a mighty warrior?if the monarch needs a stalwart battle captain,
he may demand Gronyard?s services. If our hero is unwilling (or perhaps unable,
for example if he accompanied his goods caravan), than he might have to pay a
significant scutage fee?perhaps even handing over his treasure golden comb!
<P></P>
As the year passes, Gronyard?s wealth will change. His house and lands will
require upkeep, and servants will have to be paid. Still, his tenants might
provide him with tax income, or his trading caravan might return with goods worth
two or three times his initial investment!
