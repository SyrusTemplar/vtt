</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> When a character hits a monster, or vice versa, damage is suffered by the
victim. The amount of damage depends on the weapon or method of attack. In <A HREF="DD01615.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01615.htm">Table 44</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> of Chapter 6, all weapons are rated for the amount of damage they inflict to
Small, Medium, and Large targets. This is given as a die range (1d8, 2d6, etc.).
<P></P>
Each time a hit is scored, the appropriate dice are rolled and the damage is
subtracted from the current hit points of the target. An <A HREF="MM_DD04023.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="MM_DD04023.htm">orc</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> that attacks with a sword, for example, causes damage according to the
information given for the type of sword it uses. A <A HREF="MM_DD04079.htm#7b8baad4"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="MM_DD04079.htm#7b8baad4">troll</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> that bites once and rends with one of its clawed hands causes 2d6 points of
damage with its bite and 1d4 + 4 points with its claw. (The DM gets this
information from the <I>Monstrous-Manual </I>supplement.)
<P></P>
Sometimes damage is listed as a die range along with a bonus of +1 or more.
The troll's claw attack, above, is a good example. This bonus may be due to high
Strength, magical weapons, or the sheer ferocity of the creature's attack. The
bonus is added to whatever number comes up on the die roll, assuring that some
minimum amount of damage is caused. Likewise, penalties can also be applied,
but no successful attack can result in less than 1 point of damage.
<P></P>
Sometimes an attack has both a die roll and a damage multiplier. The number
rolled on the dice is multiplied by the multiplier to determine how much damage
is inflicted. This occurs mainly in backstabbing attempts. In cases where damage
is multiplied, only the base damage caused by the weapon is multiplied.
Bonuses due to Strength or magic are not multiplied; they are added after the rolled
damage is multiplied.
