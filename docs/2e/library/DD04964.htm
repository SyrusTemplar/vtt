Bard kits should be taken only when the character is first created. The one
exception might occur when this handbook is first introduced into a campaign. In
this case, the Dungeon Master may allow certain existing bards to be converted
to the kits that most resemble the manner in which they have been played in the
past. However, note that such a transfer will have to be adjudicated by the
Dungeon Master.
<P></P>
If a player decides to drop a bard kit, he should meet with his Dungeon Master
to discuss the manner in which the transition should occur. When a kit is
dropped, the character becomes a core bard (not a True Bard), and that character
cannot regain his old kit. This has the following effects upon the character:

<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> The bard's four bonus proficiencies must either be dropped or all future
nonweapon proficiency slots must be spent paying for them before any new nonweapon
proficiencies can be selected.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> The character no longer needs to pay attention to his old kit's suggested
nonweapon proficiencies.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> The character can wear any armor normally allowed to the core bard, but cannot
use any other type of armor (including shields).
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> All special benefits are lost.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> All special hindrances are ignored.

It is possible for a bard to change kits, but only in one very limited manner.
First, the bard's existing kit must be dropped. Then, if the bard wants, he
may gain a new kit, but it must be the True Bard kit. The process for gaining the
True Bard kit goes as follows.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Once the bard's old bonus nonweapon proficiencies are either dropped or paid
for, the next available proficiency slots must be spent gaining singing, musical
instrument, reading/writing (native tongue), and local history.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> As the bard gains the next four levels, he gains one of the True Bard's
special benefits at each new level. The specific benefit gained is determined by the
player.
