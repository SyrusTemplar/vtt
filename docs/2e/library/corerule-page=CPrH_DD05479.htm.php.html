In many human cultures, only the priest can perform marriages, so the DM may
wish for this to be a duty of priests in his campaign.
<P></P>
The DM will need to decide for his campaign whether or not marriages require
the ministrations of priests, and might make a different choice for each
sentient races. If humans require priests for marriage, do dwarves? (Perhaps they use
advocates and notaries instead.) Do elves? (Perhaps their marriages are
officiated by bards, who write songs commemorating the event as a sort of &quot;marriage
certificate.&quot;) Do halflings? (Perhaps they prefer ceremonies presided over by
sheriffs or judges.)
<P></P>
Also, the DM can always decide that priests of certain faiths cannot perform
marriages. What, for example, does the god of weaponmaking have to do with
marriage? On the other hand, it's equally appropriate for priests of <I>any</I> god to be able to perform marriages. This is especially true if, in the
campaign, marriage constitutes permission or recognition from &quot;higher forces,&quot; and
any god, including those with attributes unrelated to marriage, may bless a
marriage.
