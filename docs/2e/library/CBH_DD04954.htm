<B>Specialty:</B> Dance/Instruments/Singing.
<P></P>
<B>Qualifications:</B> Standard ability scores. Gypsy-bards cannot be lawful neutral. Elves can
become Gypsy-bards able to advance to the 9th level.
<P></P>
<B>Introduction:</B> <I>I'm known as Madraime, and I'm a Gypsy lady. Oh, I'm not what most people
would call a typical Gypsy. Within the society of gypsies, there are many different
types of individuals. I am what is known as a Gypsy-bard, performing-Gypsy, or
dancing-girl.
<P></P>
I travel with my father's caravan, performing for the locals of a region as we
pass through. When I'm not singing and dancing for the outsiders, I often
entertain those of my caravan in the evening hours. There is nothing as lovely as
spending an evening among my own kind, dancing, singing, and enjoying the
company of those who understand the world.
<P></P>
Like all Gypsies, I realize that humans, elves, dwarves, and others were meant
to lead lives of inner discovery, peaceful joy, and association with nature. I
know that many people distrust Gypsies, calling us thieves and worse. This
occurs because we Gypsies are misunderstood. Our beliefs are so pure and so
natural that they are hard for outsiders to understand.
<P></P>
For example, as a Gypsy, I understand that ownership of an item exists only so
long as the item is not ignored or forgotten. If I lay down my magical dagger,
walk away, and one of my brothers should find it, the dagger is then his. If I
want it back I must trade him something in exchange.
<P></P>
How can anyone claim to own something that they aren't using or aren't
holding? What gives a king the right to say that he owns the land of a country? The
land was there before he or his family ever lived, and it will be there long
after they are all dead. Likewise, how can a farmer claim that he owns the sheep
that feed upon the land? These sheep exist because they eat the fruit of the
land, and the land belongs to no one. The ways of outsiders are very odd indeed.
<P></P>
We Gypsies are a peaceful folk who wish only to travel upon the good earth,
laugh, sing, and live the ways of life.
<P></P>
</I> <B>Description:</B> This kit defines the role of the bard in Gypsy life. Gypsies can be treated
as a coherent society or as any group with a nomadic lifestyle.
<P></P>
Gypsies are often called &quot;forest nomads.&quot; They travel the lands in caravans
comprising carts, wagons, horses, and the Gypsy folk. These people are well known
for their strange Gypsy music and dances. Some caravans survive by
entertaining the communities they encounter. Not all gypsies are bards; the Gypsy-bard is
only one type of character that fills the ranks of a Gypsy band.
<P></P>
Gypsy ways are strange to others and poorly understood by most. They do not
recognize the existence of private property. The fruits of the land belong to
all. If there is not enough to go around, it is easy enough to pack the wagons and
move along. Likewise, Gypsies use only what they need and do not seek wealth
or possessions for their own sake, or for the influence or power that they
bring. They do not have a king or queen, although sometimes they will lay claim to
these titles to gain advantage in bartering (when outsiders believe this, the
Gypsies take it as proof of their gullibility and stupidity).
<P></P>
Gypsy-bards have an entire collection of unconventional concepts that make up
their philosophy of life:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Gypsy-bards are free thinkers. For example, many do not marry, seeking
companionship only for as long as both parties agree to the arrangement.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Gypsy-bards love nature.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Many Gypsy-bards don't worship deities (although certain deities may look over
them). Instead, they worship the concepts of nature, free will, and life.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Gypsy-bards draw their energies from their free will, their brethren, and from
their natural surroundings.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> A Gypsy-bard is loyal to and protects his friends, but friendship must be
earned, and it is not gained easily.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Possession and ownership are the same.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Money is useless unless it brings you pleasure; trade is a better form of
commerce.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> You should always dress and act naturally and comfortably.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> The rigid customs and beliefs of non-Gypsies are foolish and should be ignored.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Only a fellow Gypsy truly understands the Gypsy way of life. Others wrongly
classify Gypsies as thieves, beggars, carnival people, nomads, or any number of
other erroneous names. If a label must be used, the most accurate is &quot;free-men.&quot;
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> Gypsy-bards wander the land, experiencing life as they go. They travel until
they find something of interest: a beautiful glade, an interesting village, an
audience to sing and dance before, or someone who wants to trade with them.
Then they establish a temporary camp and remain until their need to see more of
the world overpowers their desire to stay.
<P></P>
An adventuring Gypsy-bard may be on a personal quest to locate some special
animal or flower for the &quot;Gypsy queen,&quot; or he could simply be out to experience
the great wonders that appear along the adventuring path. In any event, a
Gypsy-bard always has a purpose and philosophy to his adventuring, even if it is &quot;to
wander for the sake of wandering.&quot;
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> Forester, Gambler, Groom, Hunter, Jeweler, Teamster/Freighter,
Trader/Barterer.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Gypsy-bards must take either dagger or knife, and their first sword (if any
is ever taken) must be either the khopesh or scimitar. Gypsy-bards cannot become
proficient in the following weapons: battle axe, lance (any), polearm (any),
trident, two-handed sword, bastard sword, or warhammer. All other weapons are
available to them.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonuses:</I> Dancing, Direction Sense, Languages (modern-Gypsy), Musical Instrument
(tambourine, violin, mandolin). <I>Suggested:</I> Ancient History, Astrology, Cooking, Craft Instrument, Disguise,
Fire-Building, Gaming, Herbalism, Hunting, Juggling, Singing, Spellcraft, Survival,
Tracking, Ventriloquism, Weather Sense.
<P></P>
<B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Gypsy-bards can wear only leather, padded, studded leather, hide, or elven
chain mail. The other types are too noisy, bulky, and are considered to be impure
and unnatural.
<P></P>
Both male and female Gypsy-bards love to wear gaudy jewelry. Their garments
are typically loose-fitting and comfortable.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B>
<P></P>
<I>Animal Rapport:</I> Gypsy-bards are nearly druidical in their ability to associate with animals.
They automatically gain the proficiencies of animal handling, animal lore,
animal training, and riding (land-based). Furthermore, their training and riding
skills extend to any animal with which they become familiar.
<P></P>
At 5th, 10th and 15th levels, Gypsy-bards gain the ability to cause certain
spell-like effects, each once per day. At 5th level, they are able to cause the
effects of <I>animal friendship</I> by speaking kindly in the secret language of their own (Gypsy dialect). At
10th level, they can concentrate and gain the benefits of a <I>locate animals</I> <I>or plants</I> spell. Finally, at 15th level, they gain the <I>speak with animals</I> ability.
<P></P>
<I>Allure of the Gypsies:</I> Certain Gypsy songs and dances are very alluring and can have powerful
influences over those who willingly listen or take part. For such performances to
function, a group of at least three Gypsy-bards must be performing together, or
the audience must be willingly participating.
<P></P>
These performances take at least 1d10 turns. The effect of such performances
can be identical to any one spell of the enchantment/charm school (as determined
by the dance). However, at least one of the main performers must be high
enough level to cast the spell. It is not required that the performer have the spell
memorized, but he must have personal knowledge of it (in his spell books; roll
a successful &quot;chance to learn spell&quot; check). The spell range, duration, and
other effects that vary by caster level are determined by the eligible
performer's level, as if he actually cast the desired spell.
<P></P>
<I>Fortune Telling:</I> By using any magical item suited for scrying or divining the future, such as
a <I>crystal ball</I> or <I>medallion of ESP</I>, a Gypsy-bard can gain the benefits of an <I>augury</I> spell. Each day, the Gypsy-bard can ask one question per five levels of
experience (rounded up). Note that Gypsy-bards can even tell fortunes by using
magical scrying items that are not otherwise usable by them. For example, <I>crystal balls</I> are usable only by wizards, and not even a Gypsy-bard can gain the typical
benefits of the ball. However, by looking into one and concentrating, a
Gypsy-bard can ask one <I>augury</I> --style yes/no question per five levels, during that day.
<P></P>
Besides items suited for scrying and divining the future, Gypsy-bards are able
to perform the same feat with a <I>deck of many things</I>. Additionally, when a <I>deck of many things</I> is used by the Gypsy-bard for this purpose, the cards turned never affect him
for good or bad. Drawing the void or the donjon card will not cause the deck
to vanish. However, the deck still functions normally when used for purposes
other than the augury.
<P></P>
<I>Psionics:</I> An unusually large number of Gypsy-bards are psionic. If the optional
psionics rules are used (see <I>The Complete Psionics Handbook</I>), all player character Gypsy-bards should be wild talent psionics. Psionic
talents are determined by whatever method the DM prefers.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> A Gypsy-bard's climb walls ability works best when climbing trees. They are
not skilled at climbing cliffs, building walls, or cave walls; they suffer a 25%
penalty when scaling these surfaces.
