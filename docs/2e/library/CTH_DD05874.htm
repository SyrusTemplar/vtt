Here, thieves have so many dealings with merchants that they actually start to
get involved in commerce directly. This often happens as a natural evolution
from either a standoff or a submission relationship. Thieves start to become
merchants. They may have been spies in merchants employ before, they may &quot;take
over&quot; the businesses of merchants they have bankrupted or driven off, or they may
enter businesses their talents suit them for (e.g., as locksmiths, gem-cutters,
moneylenders, pawnbrokers, and the like).

This has several attractions for the thief. First, additional income can be
produced. Second, the business can be a simple exploitation of a skill or
proficiency the thief already has. Third, it can provide a good cover for a thief.
Fourth, there may be a more nefarious motive or two (&quot;Ah, sir wants a combination
lock which will be absolutely thief-proof! I have just the thing . . .&quot;; why
shouldn't a locksmith have the best lockpicks in town when apprehended by the
constables down a dark alleyway at night?
<P></P>
At its most extreme, thieves can actually come to dominate commercial life, or
at least to play a major role in it. Organized crime becomes big business. The
thieves may even become important figures in society, and have political
power. The City of Greyhawk is one notable example of this.
