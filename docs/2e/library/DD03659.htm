<FONT SIZE="3">This potent spell exchanges the necromancer&#146;s own
living heart for a finely crafted heart of perfect, unblemished stone
that alters the very nature of the wizard&#146;s body. As long as the <I>heart
of stone </I>remains in effect, the caster need not fear attacks
that pierce, slash, or cut him; he does not bleed and can ignore the
most horrible injuries of this kind. The caster can also ignore most
magical effects such as spells, magical devices, and innate spell
abilities of less than 8th level.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">In game terms, the character suffers only 1 point of
damage from any type S or type P attack, plus any magical adjustment
for the weapon. For example, if struck by a <I>long sword +1</I>, he
would suffer only 2 points of damage. Strength and specialization
bonuses are ignored. If the wizard is dismembered, he suffers no
additional damage other than the inconvenience of having his limbs
removed, and he can reattach a severed limb by holding it in place
for one full turn. The <I>heart of stone </I>is also partially
effective against type B attacks since it prevents bruising,
swelling, and crushed blood vessels. Against bludgeoning weapons, the
wizard only suffers half the normal damage. <I>Cause wound spells </I>always
inflict minimum damage against a wizard protected by this spell.
While the caster may not feel a sword in his rib cage, any damage
sustained interrupts spellcasting.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">In addition to resisting injury, the <I>heart of stone </I>also
renders the character immune to fatigue and exhaustion, whether
normal or magical. He also gains a +4 bonus to saving throws vs.
petrification attacks.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">While the <I>heart of stone </I>is quite powerful, it
has limitations. First of all, determined physical attack can
eventually destroy the wizard despite his unnatural resistance to
injury&#151;a mob of angry peasants with hatchets and spears can
finish him off 1 point at a time if that&#146;s what it takes.
Second, the <I>heart </I>confers no protection against other attack
forms, such as fire, electricity, cold, acid, and so on, although any
bleeding caused by a burn is ignored. <I>Disintegration </I>effects
also affect the caster. Most importantly, the caster loses the
ability to naturally recover from injury and no longer regains lost
hit points with the passage of time. Healing spells, potions and
items are reduced to their minimum effect, so a <I>cure serious
wounds </I>(2d8+1 hit points restored) would only return 3 hit points
to a wizard protected by heart of stone. However, <I>limited wish </I>or
<I>wish </I>can be used to restore 1 hit point per level of caster
or all but 1d4 hit points, respectively.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">In addition to these disadvantages, <I>heart of stone </I>also
renders the caster vulnerable in one other way: his own real heart
can be destroyed, instantly slaying him. Naturally, the caster will
want to take steps to hide and protect his true heart to prevent this
from happening. The living heart continues to beat for the duration
of the spell but requires no special receptacle or facilities to
protect it&#151;the caster could leave it lying on the floor, if he wished.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The <I>heart of stone </I>cannot be dispelled,
although a more powerful negation magic such as <I>Mordenkainen&#146;s
disjunction </I>can bring the spell to an end. <I>Stone to flesh </I>also
undoes the magic of the <I>heart of stone</I>. No matter how the
spell is ended, the wizard&#146;s own living heart instantly returns
to its proper place, and the stone heart appears wherever the living
heart was kept. At this time, any injuries the wizard currently has
are multiplied by 1d6 as the wounds begin to bleed again. For
example, a necromancer who was injured for 6 points of damage instead
suffers 6d6 when the spell ends.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The material component for this spell is the stone
heart itself. This must be a carved stone of quality (jade, obsidian,
or gold-veined marble would be appropriate) worth not less than 5,000
gold pieces. It must be prepared by use of the <I>enchant an item </I>spell.
The stone is not consumed at the spell&#146;s end and may be used
again if it is undamaged.</FONT></P>
