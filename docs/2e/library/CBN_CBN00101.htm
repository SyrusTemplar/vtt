By casting this spell, a wizard transfers some of the wounds of another
creature to him- or herself, thereby partially curing the recipient. Up to 2 hp per
level of the caster may be transferred, so a 10th level necromancer could cure
an ally of a 20-hp wound (but the wizard will then take 20 hp in damage).
<P></P>
The hit point loss could have originally resulted from physical attacks,
certain poisons, spell effects, diseases, or curses (except those that cannot be
removed by the <I>remove curse </I>spell). This spell cannot restore amputated limbs, drained life levels, or
lost life. It also cannot undo any continuously acting poison or disease. The
spell only temporarily reverses such harm, which will then continue to affect the
victim.
<P></P>
The caster cannot drain his or her own life. Normally, a wizard can only
transfer up to his or her current number of hit points. However, if the DM makes use
of the rules for “hovering on death’s door” (page 75 of the <I>DMG</I>), then a necromancer might be voluntarily drained to the brink of death (–9
hp). Of course, the mage immediately loses consciousness in such a case (as
noted in the <I>DMG</I>), but his or her condition does not deteriorate unless further wounded by
another agent. At the DM’s discretion, this spell also enables a necromancer to
immediately restore an incapacitated and dying victim, as per the 3rd-level
priest spell <I>death’s door</I>. Unlike the priest version, however, hit points cured by the <I>wound transfer</I> are inflicted on the caster. Hit points lost by the wizard may be regained by
normal healing or magic.
<P></P>
Finally, after the <I>transfer</I> is complete, the wizard temporarily loses four points of Constitution due to
extreme exhaustion; each point may be recovered by six turns of complete rest.
If the caster’s Constitution drops below 3, unconsciousness results, and full
Constitution is not regained for 24 hours. The material components are hair and
blood from both the recipient and the caster, two newt eyes, and two wolf teeth
(each from a different animal). These components are consumed in the casting.
