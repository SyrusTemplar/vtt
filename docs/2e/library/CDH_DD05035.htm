The rare gray druids inhabit and tend the shadowy realms of the hidden life
that exists without sunlight--fungi, molds, and slimes--and the nocturnal
creatures that dwell in lightless, subterranean realms. Gray druids are more closely
associated with the earth than with other elements of Nature. While many of them
live in underground caves or ruins (especially in the Underdark), they are
found any place fungal life grows abundantly, either above or below ground.
<P></P>
Gray druids tend to oppose dungeon delvers, especially dwarves, who they
believe defile and exploit the underground environment. They have very good
relations with deep gnomes and passable relations with drow, who they feel show more
appreciation of the beauty of the Underdark than most dwarves or men.
<P></P>
But the gray druids don't always oppose surface dwellers. Suppose a maze of
caverns has developed a complex ecology: fungi, slimes, rust monsters,
subterranean lizards, purple worms, and so on. Then an evil wizard and his ogres move in
and begin &quot;clearing&quot; the caverns, destroying the monsters in preparation to
establish an underground stronghold. In this situation, the gray druid Rybna
(pictured on p. 11) might recruit a party of adventurers--not to loot the caverns
(though the PCs may take the wizard's treasure) but to defeat the wizard's
forces--and in so doing, save the local ecology from destruction.

<B>Granted Powers:</B> A gray druid like Rybna has the following granted powers:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> Identifies with perfect accuracy pure water, fungi, subterranean animals, and
all slimes, puddings, jellies and molds (including monster types) at 3rd level.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> Learns the languages of subterranean creatures (orcs, goblins, troglodytes,
xorn, etc.), gaining one extra proficiency slot every three levels (at 3rd, 6th,
etc.) for this purpose.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> Controls fungi, jellies, molds, oozes, puddings, and slimes (nonintelligent or
of animal Intelligence) at 7th level. The druid can use this power once per
day to control 1 Hit Die of creatures per level. It affects only a 30-yard radius
around the druid. For instance, Rybna, a 10th-level druid, could control two 5
HD slimes or one 10 HD pudding. The creatures receive no saving throw, but
remain controlled only as long as they stay within 30 yards of the druid. An
uncontrolled creature reverts to its normal behavior patterns. A gray druid like
Rybna will not send a controlled monster to its death unless by doing so she can
protect the subterranean ecology. This power does not animate a stationary
entity or grant it any new abilities. (Rybna could command a shrieker to shriek or
be silent or move, but not to sing or speak.) Control lasts for one turn per
level of the druid.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> Shapechanges into a normal reptile, a normal mammal, or a nonpoisonous giant
spider at 7th level; the druid can assume each form once per day. The druid can
change only into a reptile or mammal that dwells underground, such as a mole,
badger, tunnel snake, etc. The ability is otherwise identical to <A HREF="PHB_DD01493.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01493.htm">druidic shapechanging in the PH</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
<B>Special Limitation:</B> Gray druid Animal sphere spells affect only animals native to subterranean
environments. So, Rybna could cast <I>animal friendship</I> on a rat, a huge spider, or a badger, but not on a wolf or horse.
<P></P>
A gray druid has a -2 penalty on saving throws against spells creating bright
light, such as continual light.
<P></P>
Due to long enmity, dwarves react to gray druids at -2. (The reverse is also
true.)
<P></P>
<B>Holy Symbol and Grove:</B> Gray druids use a puffball mushroom grown and harvested in complete darkness
as their holy symbol. They usually take part of an underground cavern--a
thriving subterranean ecosystem--for a grove.
