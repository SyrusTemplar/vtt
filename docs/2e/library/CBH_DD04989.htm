This is a very special spell created specifically for the bard class. Before
this spell can be used, the bard must have a special cabinet made. It must be of
the highest quality, worth at least 1,000 gold pieces. It can be any size up
to 4 feet wide by 4 feet deep by 8 feet high.
<P></P>
Once the cabinet is made, this spell must be cast upon it and the cabinet must
be named. At any later date, the bard can cast this spell and the cabinet
temporarily teleports to the bard's current location. The cabinet carries with it
any contents that are of a performing nature usable by the bard. (For example,
it might contain musical instruments, cleaning tools, a playing stool, <I>etc</I>., for a True Bard. It might be lined with throwing daggers, rapiers {for
sword swallowing}, and blindfolds for a Blade).
<P></P>
When the cabinet teleports to the bard, a percentile die must be rolled. On a
01-04, it appears 2d20 feet in the air and falls, destroying itself (but its
contents are recoverable). On a roll of 99-00, it teleports into the ground and
is destroyed. Otherwise, it is safe.
<P></P>
The cabinet remains for the duration of the spell or until the bard speaks the
cabinet's name. It then teleports safely back to its previous location, along
with any carried items of a performing nature usable by the bard.
<P></P>
A bard may have only one such cabinet at a time. The teleport will not carry
the cabinet to another plane. If items of a nonperforming nature are left in the
cabinet, then the cabinet will not teleport.
