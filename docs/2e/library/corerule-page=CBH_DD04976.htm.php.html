This section examines most of the core bard's common abilities. These include
pick pockets, detect noise, climb walls, read languages, and the bard's
10th-level ability to use any written magical item.
<P></P>
The first four of these abilities are collectively known as a bard's &quot;thief
skills,&quot; as they mimic the thief skills of the same name. As stated in the<I> Player's Handbook</I> under the section on the thief class, thief skills cannot be raised above
95%, no matter what modifiers are applied.
