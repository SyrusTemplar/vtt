</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> In this type of campaign, the characters are mostly single-class warriors, and
each may have a different Warrior Kit. With the DM's permission, multi-class
and dual-class characters (so long as one of the class choices is Fighter),
priests and rogues may also be played, but the majority of player-characters (over
half) <I>must</I> be single-class warriors. And the DM, if he wants a fighters-only campaign,
never has to give permission for those other character classes to be played.
<P></P>
In a campaign devoted to Warriors, the DM should foster an attitude that it's
more desirable to be a fighter than another class of character. Other classes
may be allowed, but are usually represented by only one character each.
<P></P>
One way to foster this attitude is for the warrior-characters to get the
lion's share of admiration from the people. Characters belonging to other classes
will get from the public the minimum amount of admiration they deserve for their
deeds, but such acclaim shouldn't be their main motivation; these characters
must have other goals if they're to be satisfied in such a campaign.
