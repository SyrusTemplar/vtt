When possible, the DM should select the magical items he will give out in his
campaign. Sometimes, though, a fast and random selection may be needed. In this
case, if the DM rolls 99 or 00 on Table 88 of the <I>Dungeon Master's Guide</I> (p. 135), he should not roll for a magical weapon, but make a simple d20 roll
on Table 32 below.
<P></P>
The items shown in the later tables fall into three categories:
<P></P>
(i) Items restricted to use by thieves only. These are indicated by (T)
following the title of the item in the tables.
<P></P>
(ii) Items which do not have to be restricted to thieves only, but which have
more than one effect, with at least some of their effects being of value for
thieves alone. That is, thieves will benefit far more from these items than other
characters. These are indicated by (T*) following the title of the item in the
tables. The DM may well wish to rule that these items can only be used by
thieves in his campaign.
<P></P>
(iii) Items which can be used by nonthieves as well as thieves, but which are
clearly important for such typical thief activities as spying, stealing,
snooping, sneaking and such.
<P></P>
As a general note, most of the items in this section are of relatively low
power. This should allow DMs to introduce one or two such items into even a fairly
low-magic campaign with no fear of upsetting game balance.

For each of the later tables 33 through 36, a simple d6 roll is used to
determine
<P></P>
the nature of the item found. None of these later tables has any subtables to
worry about.
