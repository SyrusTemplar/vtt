<B>Description:</B> Spells of this school enable the caster to channel magical energies to cause
direct and specific change in an existing object, creature, or condition.
Alterations can affect a subject's form (<I>polymorph other</I>), weight (<I>feather fall</I>), abilities (<I>strength</I>), location (<I>teleport without error</I>), or even his physical well-being (<I>death fog</I>).
<P></P>
<B>Specialist Name:</B> Transmuter.
<P></P>
<B>Allowed Races:</B> Only a caster with human blood can channel the magical energies necessary for
alteration spells. Hence, only humans and half-elves can become transmuters.
<P></P>
<B>Ability Requirements:</B> Because alteration spells have somewhat more complex somatic components than
spells from other schools, a wizard needs a Dexterity score of at least 15 to
become a transmuter.
<P></P>
<B>Saving Throw Modifiers:</B> All opponents modify their saving throws by -1 when attempting to save
against an alteration spell cast by a transmuter. A transmuter adds a +1 bonus when
saving against alteration spells cast by others.
<P></P>
<B>Bonus Spells and Acquired Powers:</B> A transmuter can memorize an extra spell at each spell level, providing that
at least one of the memorized spells is from the school of alteration. When a
transmuter reaches 17th level, he receives one extra non- weapon wizard
proficiency of his choice; this is in addition to the number of non-weapon
proficiencies he is normally allowed. When he reaches 20th level, he receives another extra
non-weapon wizard proficiency. If the wizard already has all of the non-weapon
wizard proficiencies available to him when he reaches level 17 (or level 20),
he may take a general non-weapon proficiency instead.
<P></P>
<B>Oppositional Schools:</B> A transmuter can't learn spells from the schools of abjuration and
necromancy.
<P></P>
<B>Spell Analysis:</B> No school has a wider variety of spells than the school of alteration, making
the transmuter the most versatile of all the specialists. The available spells
can be assigned to six general groups:
<P></P>
1. Defensive Spells. This group of protective spells offers defensive
capabilities rivaling those of the abjuration school. This group includes spells that
limit an opponent's ability to attack, such as <I>fog cloud, solid fog, slow</I>, and <I>darkness, 15' radius</I>, and also spells that provide direct protection to the caster and his party,
such as<I> stoneskin</I> and <I>Leomund's tiny hut</I>.
<P></P>
2. Offensive Spells. This group includes spells such as <I>strength</I> and <I>haste </I>which increase the party's chance to inflict damage, and spells such as <I>Melf's minute meteors</I> and <I>death fog</I> which inflict damage directly.
<P></P>
3. Mobility Spells. This group includes <I>fly, blink, passwall</I>, and <I>teleport</I> and other spells that improve the caster's ability to move from place to
place.
<P></P>
4. Security Spells. This group enables the caster to protect objects and
places, and includes spells such as <I>wizard lock, guards and wards</I>, and <I>Leomund's secret chest</I>.
<P></P>
5. Talent Spells. This group gives the caster (or a person of the caster's
choice) a temporary talent, usually one that duplicates a special ability of
another creature or race. Such spells include <I>infravision, water breathing,</I> and <I>tongues</I>.
<P></P>
6. Special Spells. This group encompasses a wide range of spells that don't
fit into into any of the previous categories, such as <I>magic mouth, mending, message</I>, and <I>fool's gold</I>. Because of the variety of spells available, a transmuter can assume a number
of different roles in an adventuring party. For instance, a transmuter who
knows a number of offensive spells can battle effectively alongside a party's
warriors. A transmuter who knows a few mobility spells in addition to some
offensive spells makes an especially impressive combatant (imagine a <I>flying</I> transmuter soaring to the top of a tree, then casting <I>Melf's minute meteors</I> at an unsuspecting enemy). With a supply of defensive spells, a transmuter
can assume many of the functions of an abjurer. A transmuter with <I>spider climb, deeppockets</I>, and <I>knock</I> is a good substitution for a thief; add <I>polymorph self</I> and <I>passwall</I>, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a better spy. The transmuter always runs
the risk of being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of available spells and making
haphazard or ill-informed decisions about which spells he learns and
memorizes. Therefore, he must take care to balance his spell choices with the needs of
his party.
<P></P>
<B>Most Desirable Spells:</B>
<P></P>
Low-Level: Of the 1st-level spells, <I>burning hands</I> is a nice choice for an offensive spell since it has a longer range than <I>shocking grasp</I> and does more damage at higher levels. <I>Chromatic orb</I> is a better choice yet. With its reversible option, <I>enlarge</I> gives the transmuter a wealth of options and is particularly useful in combat
since it affects damage rolls. <I>Fog cloud</I> and <I>pyrotechnics</I> both have two different forms, essentially giving the transmuter two spells
for the price of one.<I> Fly</I> expands the transmuter's strategic options and is perhaps the best all-around
low-level alteration spell. Both <I>slow</I> and <I>haste</I> can influence melee combat dramatically, since a number of subjects are
affected at the same time.
<P></P>
Medium-Level:<I> Polymorph self</I> and <I>polymorph other</I> can disguise friendly characters, intimidate enemies, and in the case of <I>polymorph other</I>, greatly enhance the party's chance of combat success, since the subject's
Armor Class and attack routines can be improved by the spell. <I>Death fog</I> and <I>disintegrate</I> are powerful offensive spells, and <I>teleport</I> is a first-rate mobility spell. Of the medium-level spells, there are none
better than <I>Tenser's transformation</I>, assuming the transmuter has a dagger or staff at hand to take advantage of
his increased attack effectiveness, and <I>Mordenkainen's lucubration</I>, which gives the transmuter access to any 1st-level through 5th-level spell
used in the previous 24 hours.
<P></P>
High-Level: <I>Incendiary cloud</I> is a terrific offensive spell, and <I>shape change</I> and<I> time stop</I> are both helpful in a variety of situations. The most useful high- level
spell is probably <I>polymorph any object</I>, since it can duplicate the effects of many other spells, including <I>polymorph other, transmute rock to mud,</I> and <I>stone to flesh</I>.
<P></P>
<B>Ethos:</B> Wizards drawn to the specialty of alteration are typically curious,
sharp-minded, and deeply analytical. Fascinated by putting things together and taking
them apart again, they are natural tinkerers, more interested in objects than in
people.
<P></P>
Transmuters generally aren't prone to profound philosophic insights, as their
minds are more attuned to how things work than how a society functions. To a
transmuter, a person is essentially a complicated, difficult-to-understand
machine. They are obsessive collectors, excellent scholars, and clear thinkers.
According to a transmuter, the only constant in the universe is change; concepts
of good and evil are relative, dependent on existing conditions, and seldom
permanent. Forces of good and evil are constantly at work on neutrality, but since
good causes less disruption than evil, good is preferable. Consequently, many
transmuters are of good alignments.
<P></P>
Eager to explore the world around them, transmuters are willing members of
adventuring parties. They are loyal followers but reluctant leaders, since they
have trouble making decisions based on instinct alone. Although loyal to their
friends, they seldom establish close relationships. Married transmuters are few.
<P></P>
Transmuters are most comfortable in large cities where they have access to a
variety of supplies, consultants, and other resources for their studies. Most
societies welcome transmuters, generally considering them to be emotionally
distant but harmless eccentrics. Transmuters commonly earn their livings as
teachers, advisors, inventors, and manufacturers of medicines, potions, and other
preparations
