This peculiar wild magic creates a random fluctuation in the probabilities of
existence. The spell can be cast only upon nonliving objects and can affect
only materials within a 10'x10'x10' cube.
<P></P>
Objects in the area of effect either remain normal and visible or they
disappear (50% chance). The state of existence for any object is determined randomly
and changes with each viewing and viewer. Thus, a single object could appear and
disappear several times during the course of the spell. Furthermore, it might
be &quot;there&quot; for one onlooker, but &quot;not there&quot; for another.
<P></P>
For example, a wild mage casts this spell on a doorway. The DM rolls
percentile dice and determines the door is &quot;there&quot; for the wizard. The wizard's
companion also looks at the door. The DM rolls and determines that the door is &quot;not
there&quot; for the companion. The pair studies the door for several minutes, during
which time the door does not change (this counts as a single viewing for each
character).
<P></P>
The wizard and his companion then close their eyes. When they look at the door
again, new checks for each character reveal the door is &quot;not there&quot; for both
characters. The pair steps through the open archway and turns around to look at
the door once again. This time it is &quot;not there&quot; for the wizard, but &quot;there&quot;
for his companion. This random changing continues throughout the duration of the
spell.
<P></P>
Objects that are &quot;there&quot; are normal in all respects. Doors can be opened,
chests can be picked up and carried, and rocks can be used as barricades. Objects
that are &quot;not there&quot; are gone, although their absence does not cause ceilings to
collapse or other damage. A wizard could walk through a &quot;not there&quot; wall
without difficulty.
<P></P>
When two parties perceive a <I>there/not there</I> object differently, the object functions for each party according to its own
perceptions. For example, a wizard hides behind a rock that he sees as &quot;there.&quot;
Her enemy, a fighter, perceives the rock as &quot;not there&quot; and fires arrows at
the wizard. The wizard would perceive the arrows as bouncing off the rock, while
the fighter would perceive the arrows as missing their target or falling short.
The fighter would be subject to a check before firing each arrow to determine
whether his perception changes (assume that the fighter must look away from the
rock every time he nocks an arrow; each time he takes aim, this counts as a
new viewing).
<P></P>
After the spell is cast, any objects removed from the area of effect retain
their uncertain existence for the duration of the spell. Thus, a pair of heroes
could pick up a treasure chest, carry it down the hall, set it down, and
discover it had vanished while their backs were turned. Worse still, one might see the
chest and the other not!
<P></P>
The material component is a small piece of cat fur sealed inside a small box.
