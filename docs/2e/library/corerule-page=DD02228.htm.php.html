This spell enables a creature, which can be as big as the largest giant, to
tread upon air as if it were walking on solid ground. Moving upward is similar to
walking up a hill. A maximum upward angle of 45 degrees is possible at
one-half the creature's movement rate, as is a maximum downward angle of 45 degrees at
the normal movement rate. An air-walking creature is in control of its
movement, except when a strong wind is blowing. In this case, the creature gains or
loses 10 feet of movement for every 10 miles per hour of wind velocity. The
creature can, at the DM's option, be subject to additional penalties in
exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control of movement or suffering
physical damage.

The spell can be placed upon a trained mount, so it can be ridden through the
air. Of course, a mount not accustomed to such movement would certainly need
careful and lengthy training, the details for which are up to the DM.

The material components for the spell are the priest's holy symbol and a bit
of thistledown.
