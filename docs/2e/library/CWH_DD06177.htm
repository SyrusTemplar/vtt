Not surprisingly, wizards are rare commodities in worlds where little magic
exists. Most people have never seen a real wizard. In some of these societies,
wizards are confined to myths and legend. A player character wizard will likely
be restricted to low levels, and advancement will be difficult. In fact, it may
be impossible for a wizard to reach higher levels of ability-- such spells may
simply not exist. Magical items are extremely rare, if they exist at all.
Magical monsters are equally rare, but those encountered are especially formidable,
wielding powers unheard of by a typical adventuring party.
