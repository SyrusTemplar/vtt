Another matter where quality is important is in horseflesh. There is a world
of difference between a high-spirited stallion and a broken-down nag. And it is
not always apparent to the eye, although it is usually pretty easy to tell a
scrawny, sway-backed old mare from a fiery stallion. Buying of a horse is
something the player characters should always approach with care, lest some
unscrupulous horse merchant pull a fast one on them.

Further, horses often have irritating traits that can make them less than
pleasant to be around. <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD00320.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD00320.htm.php.html">Table 25</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> lists the different qualities of horses and the effects of each. Note that
not all horses need to be assigned a quality. For simplicity, you can assume all
horses are of average quality.
