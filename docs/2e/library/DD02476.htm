Spear or pike hedges are extremely effective against creatures trying to close
in for melee. Swiss pike formations could defeat the most powerful mounted
charges and could cut through many foot troops as well. Hedges don’t have to be
formed in close order, but they’re more effective if they are. Hedges can be made
doubly dangerous by adding an extra rank of spearmen or pikemen to create a
defense in depth against an enemy’s approach.
<P></P>
To form a spear hedge, characters need to stand side-by-side in an even line.
A second rank can form up behind the first rank and attack over the front rank
with a –2 penalty to attack rolls. If the polearm is a range-only weapon, such
as a pike, then the penalty does not apply. If the troops are equipped with
range 3 weapons, a third rank can be added behind the second rank.

Spear hedges are most effective when all characters choose the guard action,
since any foe foolish enough to approach could be subjected to as many as 6
attacks before he could strike back. Spear hedges can only make half-moves and
still remain together.

Like shield walls, spear hedges can be extremely effective in limited areas
where opponents can’t flank them.
