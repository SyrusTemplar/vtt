Forgery may also be a swindler's calling, including counterfeiting.
Interestingly, forgery was not a serious crime in the middle ages; barter took precedence
above coinage or credit notes, and it's hard to counterfeit a bushel of wheat
or forge livestock.

As the Renaissance came, however, and banking developed, so did the forger's
artâ€”and the punishments became serious. As late as the first half of the 19th
century in England, men and women were hanged for the crime of forging one-pound
notes.

The value of forgery, therefore, and the risks involved, will depend on the
nature of commerce and trade in your campaign.
