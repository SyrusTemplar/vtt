By means of this spell, the wizard immediately becomes aware of any attempt to
observe him by means of clairvoyance, clairaudience, or magic mirror. This
also reveals the use of crystal balls or other magical scrying devices, provided
the attempt is within the area of effect of the spell. Since the spell is
centered on the spellcaster, it moves with him, enabling him to “sweep” areas for the
duration of the spell.

When a scrying attempt is detected, the scryer must immediately roll a saving
throw. If this is failed, the identity and general location of the scryer
immediately become known to the wizard who cast this spell. The general location is
a direction and significant landmark close to the scryer. Thus, the caster
might learn, “The wizard Sniggel spies on us from east, under the stairs,” or, “You
are watched by Asquil in the city of Samarquol.”

The material components for this spell are a small piece of mirror and a
miniature brass hearing trumpet.
