This spell can be cast in one of three ways: as an anchored plane of ice, as a
hemisphere, or as a horizontal sheet to fall upon creatures with the effect of
an ice storm.
<P></P>
A) <I>Ice plane.</I> When this spell is cast, a sheet of strong, hard ice is created. The wall is
primarily defensive, stopping pursuers and the like. The wall is 1 inch thick
per level of experience of the wizard. It covers a 10-foot-square area per level
(a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high,
a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, etc.). Any creature breaking through the
ice suffers 2 points of damage per inch of thickness of the wall. Fire-using
creatures suffer 3 points of damage per inch, while cold-using creatures suffer
only 1 point of damage per inch when breaking through. The plane can be oriented
in any fashion as long as it is anchored along one or more sides.
<P></P>
B) <I>Hemisphere.</I> This casting of the spell creates a hemisphere whose maximum radius is equal
to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level. Thus, a 7th-level caster can create a
hemisphere 10 feet in radius. The hemisphere lasts until it is broken,
dispelled, or melted. Note that it is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents
under the hemisphere.
<P></P>
C) <I>Ice sheet.</I> This casting of the spell causes a horizontal sheet to fall upon opponents.
The sheet covers a 10-foot-square area per caster level. The sheet has the same
effect as an ice storm's hail stones--3d10 points of damage inflicted to
creatures beneath it.
<P></P>
A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or
creatures; its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Magical fires such as
fireballs and fiery dragon breath melt a wall of ice in one round, though this
creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts one turn. Normal fires or lesser
magical ones do not hasten the melting of a wall of ice.
<P></P>
The material component of this spell is a small piece of quartz or similar
rock crystal.
