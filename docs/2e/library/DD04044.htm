Also called fauns, satyrs are a pleasure loving race of half-human, half-goat
creatures. They symbolize nature's carefree ways. Satyrs have the torso, head,
and arms of a man, and the hind legs of a goat. The human head is surmounted by
two sharp horns that poke through the satyr's coarse, curly hair. The skin of
the upper body ranges from tan to light brown, with rare individuals (1%) with
red skin. A satyr's hair is medium, reddish, or dark brown. The horns and
hooves are black.
<P></P>
Satyrs have their own tongue and can speak elven and Common. Satyrs living
near centaurs are 80% likely to be friendly with them and speak their language.
Rarely (5%), satyrs are found with korred.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Satyrs have keen senses, so they gain a +2 bonus on surprise rolls. They can
be almost silent, and can blend with foliage so as to be 90% undetectable; this
gives opponents a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. Satyrs have infravision to a
distance of 60 feet.
<P></P>
A satyr attacks by butting with its sharp horns. Some (20%) use +1 magical
weapons, especially long or short swords, daggers, or short bows. Before resorting
to combat, a satyr often plays a tune on its pipes, an instrument only a satyr
can use properly. Using these pipes, the satyr can cast <I>charm, sleep,</I> or <I>cause fear,</I> affecting all within 60 feet, unless they make a successful saving throw vs.
spell.
<P></P>
Usually, only one satyr per band has pipes. If comely females (Charisma 15+)
are in a group met by satyrs, the piping will be to <I>charm.</I> Should the intruders be relatively inoffensive, the piping casts <I>sleep,</I> and the satyrs steal all of the victims' choice food and drink, as well as
weapons, valuables, and magical items. If intruders are hostile, the piping is
used to <I>cause fear.</I> The effects of the piping lasts 1d6 hours or until dispelled. Any creature
that saves vs. piping is not affected by additional music from the same pipes in
that encounter. A bard's singing can nullify the pipe's music before it takes
effect.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Satyrs are interested only in sport: frolicking, piping, chasing wood nymphs,
and other pleasures. They resent intrusions and drive away any creature that
offends them. A lucky wanderer may stumble on a woodland celebration, which will
contain an equal number of dryads and fauns plus 3d8 other woodland creatures
and a 25% chance of 2d6 centaurs. Strangers are welcomed only if they contribute
some good food and drink, especially superior (10+ gp per bottle) wines. Such
wine can also be used to lure or bribe satyrs. If a group includes elves, they
have a better chance of being welcomed.
<P></P>
These celebrations last all night in warm months, with newcomers waking up the
next morning with massive headaches, minus a few valuables, and not a woodland
creature (nor their tracks) to be found.
<P></P>
Shying away from the trappings of an organized society, a colony of satyrs
usually includes young numbering 50% of the adults. Satyrs live in comfortable
caves and hollow trees. There are no female satyrs and sages believe that dryads
are the female counterparts of the satyr, and that satyrs mate with dryads to
produce more satyrs and dryads. Satyrs share the dryads' affection for humans of
the opposite sex, but a female charmed by a satyr might return after 1d4 weeks
(10% chance).
<P></P>
Satyrs are an inoffensive, fun-loving race. They rarely venture more than 10
miles from their homes, most often doing so to gather food. They are fond of
venison and small game but also eat plants and fruits.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Satyrs in sylvan woodlands keep game animal populations at normal levels; they
never hunt to excess or despoil plants.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Korred
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This small, dance-loving relative of the satyr looks much like its cousins,
but lacks horns, and has wildly flowing beard and hair. Korred smell like pine
trees and fresh earth. They usually wear leather britches, carry large leather
pouches, and wield oaken cudgels. They have loud voices and speak their own
language, plus those of satyrs, dryads, centaurs, and elves; a few even speak
druidic.
<P></P>
Korred have 18/76 Strength. They hurl boulders up to 100 feet (damage 2d8), or
use cudgels (1d6 damage), shears (1d4 damage), or fists (1d2 damage), gaining
a +4 to damage because of their Strength.
<P></P>
Korred can weave their hair into entangling ropes and snares in 1d4 rounds.
Such ropes have AC 1, 5 hp, and a movement rate of 3. Anyone attacked by the
ropes must make a saving throw vs. spells or be entangled. The ropes sometimes
guard special areas.
<P></P>
A korred may use its magical <I>laugh</I> three times per day; unless it is nullified by a bard's singing, all within
60 feet must roll above their Charisma score or be stunned for 1d4 rounds.
Korred can also use the following abilities at will, one per round: <I>stone shape, animate rock, stone door</I> (teleport 30'), <I>shatter rock, transmute rock to mud,</I> and <I>stone tell.
<P></P>
</I> Korred do not have structured communities; families in a common clan live
within 5 miles of one another. Korred do not tolerate outsiders, except for rare
rangers, druids, and elves. Even these must not interrupt the weekly korred
dance. Those who interrupt must make a saving throw vs. spells or dance themselves,
losing 1d4 hp per round until dead or restrained, or until the korred stop
playing and dancing.
<P></P>
Korred pouches contain hair, shears, and other items. These items turn to gold
(5d4x10 gp value) if sprinkled with holy water. A korred will not voluntarily
give up this pouch.
