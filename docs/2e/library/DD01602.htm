<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Tumbling:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The character is practiced in all manner of acrobatics--dives, rolls,
somersaults, handstands, flips, etc. Tumbling can only be performed while burdened with
light encumbrance or less. Aside from entertaining, the character with
tumbling proficiency can improve his Armor Class by 4 against attacks directed solely
at him in any round of combat, provided he has the initiative and foregoes all
attacks that round. When in unarmed combat he can improve his attack roll by 2.

On a successful proficiency check, he suffers only one-half the normal damage
from falls of 60 feet or less and none from falls of 10 feet or less. Falls
from greater heights result in normal damage.
