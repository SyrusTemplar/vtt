This spell grants the caster a powerful sixth sense in relation to himself or
another. Although cast upon himself, the wizard can specify that he or another
is the beneficiary of the spell. Once the spell is cast, the wizard receives
instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the object of the spell.
Thus, if he were the object of the spell, the wizard would be warned in advance
if a thief were about to attempt to backstab him, or if a creature were about to
leap out from an unexpected direction, or if an attacker were specifically
targeting him with a spell or missile weapon. When the warnings are about him
personally, the wizard cannot be surprised and always knows the direction from
which any attack on him is made. In addition, the spell gives the wizard a general
idea of what action he might take to best protect himself--duck, jump right,
close his eyes, etc.--and gives him a defensive bonus of 2 to his Armor Class.

When another person is the object of the spell, the wizard receives warnings
about that person. He must still communicate this to the other person to negate
any surprise. Shouting a warning, yanking the person back, and even
telepathically communicating through a <I>crystal ball</I> can all be accomplished before the trap is sprung, if the wizard does not
hesitate. However, the object of the spell does not gain the defensive bonus to
his Armor Class.

The material component for this spell is a hummingbird's feather.
