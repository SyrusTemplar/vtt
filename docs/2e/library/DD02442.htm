</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Characters and monsters who are fatigued move and fight as if they were
encumbered one category more than they really are. For example, A character who was
moderately encumbered becomes heavily encumbered when he is fatigued.
<P></P>
Exhausted characters move and fight as if they were encumbered two categories
more than normal. An exhausted, moderately encumbered character moves and
fights as if he were severely encumbered. Usually, exhausted characters are
well-advised to catch their breath.
