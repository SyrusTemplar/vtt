This spell creates many rubbery, black tentacles in the area of effect. These
waving members seem to spring forth from the earth, floor, or whatever surface
is underfoot--including water. Each tentacle is 10 feet long, AC 4, and
requires as many points of damage to destroy as the level of the wizard who cast the
spell. There are 1d4 such tentacles, plus one per experience level of the
spellcaster.
<P></P>
Any creature within range of the writhing tentacles is subject to attack as
determined by the DM. The target of a tentacle attack must roll a saving throw
vs. spell. If this succeeds, the subject suffers 1d4 points of damage from
contact with the tentacle; the tentacle is then destroyed. Failure to save indicates
that the damage inflicted is 2d4 points, the ebon member is wrapped around its
subject, and damage will be 3d4 points on the second and all succeeding rounds.
Since these tentacles have no intelligence to guide them, there is the
possibility that they entwine any object--a tree, post, pillar, even the wizard
himself--or continue to squeeze a dead opponent. A grasping hold established by a
tentacle remains until the tentacle is destroyed by some form of attack or until
it disappears at the end of the spell's duration.
<P></P>
The component for this spell is a piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or
giant squid.
