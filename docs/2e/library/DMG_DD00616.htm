Sometimes a fire or light source can be used by intelligent creatures as a
diversion or trap. One trick is to build a fire and then set up camp away from it.
The fire attracts whatever is likely to show up in the area, allowing the
characters the chance to ambush the unwary. This is a favorite tactic of many evil
and warlike races such as orcs, bugbears, goblins, and bandits. It is also a
trick used by adventurers to lure monsters away from their real camp, although
this is somewhat dangerous.
<P></P>
Since fires are often used to determine the size and possible strength of an
enemy, dull-witted creatures and nervous player characters can be frightened
away by building a large number of campfires in an area. The enemy, counting these
fires, decides there is a huge force camping here for the night and becomes
frightened enough to leave. In reality, each fire might have but a single man or
orc tending it.

Although the radius of a light source is the limit a character can effectively
see using that source, it is not the absolute limit. The light doesn't just
end there as if it had hit a brick wall. Beyond the radius of the light, there
will still be flickering shadows, reflected eyes, and perhaps glints of metal.
Now, some of these may be nothing more than the overactive imaginations of the
player characters; others may be real threats! The DM can use this unknown factor
as a tool to build suspense in his game.
