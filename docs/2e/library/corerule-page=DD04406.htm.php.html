This spell creates a powerful set of protective wards that operate on a single
fortified building, temple complex, tower, or similar structure. These wards
protect the physical integrity of the structure and prevent magical access.
<P></P>
A building protected by <I>preservation</I> suffers only 25% of normal structural damage from sources such as siege
engines, earthquakes (both natural and magical), and powerful weather-affecting
spells. Spells which directly affect the physical integrity of the structure (e.g., <I>passwall, stone shape, transmute rock to mud</I>) simply fail when cast on the protected building.
<P></P>
Preservation creates a permanent <I>protection from evil</I> spell on the affected building. Every surface of the building benefits from
the effects of the spell.
<P></P>
Magical spells allowing access to the building fail. Thus, creatures
attempting to <I>teleport</I> or <I>fly</I> into the building are stopped. Birds and creatures with natural flight may
enter the building normally.
<P></P>
If the building is a temple (or other consecrated building) dedicated to the
Power that granted the spell, all priests inside it gain the benefit of a <I>sanctuary</I> spell for the duration of the <I>preservation</I>.
<P></P>
The <I>preservation</I> spell expires if the building is destroyed or after 60 days have passed.
