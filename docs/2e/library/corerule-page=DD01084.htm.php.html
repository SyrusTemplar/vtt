chance that it is intelligent. The feature is most common among swords, but there
are occasional instances of other weapons possessing intelligence. The chance
of intelligence varies according to the type of weapon.
<P></P>
Swords have a 25% chance of some form of intelligence. Other melee weapons
(axes, spears, polearms, etc.) have a 5% chance of intelligence, provided they do
not already possess special powers. Missile weapons (including bows, crossbows,
arrows, and bolts) never possess intelligence. Single-use items and those
items that do not have a bonus to hit (such as a magical net) never possess
intelligence.
<P></P>
If you determine that a weapon is intelligent, it will have one or more
special powers. It may also have a special purpose or limitations on its use. This
information is found under &quot;Intelligent Weapons.&quot;

the information handy whenever the possessor of the weapon is playing.

otherwise be rendered useless. A magical arrow that hits is destroyed.
