<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> All psionic powers have a MAC score. To determine if a psionic power works
against an open mind, a player must make an <A HREF="DD03212.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03212.htm">MTHAC0</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> roll against the power-s MAC score on 1d20. Any roll equal to or greater than
the number means the power has been activated and its effects are applied for
that round of play.
<P></P>
All powers have a cost per round of use. The cost listed to the left of the
slash is the number of PSPs needed to use the power for a single round. The cost
listed to the right of the slash is the number of PSPs expended if the MTHAC0
roll fails (in which case the power-s effects aren-t applied).
<P></P>
Powers that have been successfully activated can be maintained from round to
round without making additional MTHAC0 rolls. The psionicist simply expends PSPs
to pay for the power-s cost. The first round that the character fails to pay
the cost (either voluntarily or because his PSPs have been depleted), the
power-s effects cease to function. If the psionicist wishes to reactivate the power
in a later round, even against the same target, he must make a new MTHAC0 roll.
If an MTHAC0 roll to activate a psionic power fails, and the character has
enough PSPs remaining, he can try to activate the power again in the next round by
making another MTHAC0 roll.
<P></P>
A roll of 1 is always a failure and a roll of 20 is always a success, no
matter what the power-s MAC or the psionicist-s MTHAC0 scores are.
