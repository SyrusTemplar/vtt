<B>Character Description:</B> The Mercenary sees the adventuring life as a means to further his personal
wealth. He may accept a job with a party at a set salary or might agree to take a
fixed share of any treasure the party finds. Any interest he has in the
party's goals are secondary to his pocketbook.
<P></P>
Not all Mercenaries are interested in money. Some may be interested in
acquiring souvenirs for their personal collections, while others may wish to hoard
magical devices or fatten their spells books. In all cases, however, the
Mercenary's first interest is in himself.
<P></P>
A Mercenary is not necessarily a criminal or a thief-- he prides himself in
his professionalism and has no shame about his interest in wealth and material
possessions. Since his motivations are straightforward, the Mercenary is a good
personality type for novice players.

<B>Best Suited For: </B>The Mercenary is best suited for neutral alignments, particularly neutral good
and lawful neutral. Lawful good characters are less inclined to exploit others
for personal gain, while evil characters are more likely to turn to criminal
activities to increase their wealth. This personality type is suitable for any
kit.

<B>In Combat Situations:</B> The Mercenary is a good, professional combatant. He takes orders well, offers
strategic suggestions when asked, and fights valiantly alongside his
companions. However, he will not volunteer for dangerous missions, nor will he
unnecessarily risk his neck unless he gets extra pay or there's a chance of recovering
an especially desirable treasure.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>In Role-Playing Situations:</B> The Mercenary tends to let the other player characters do most of the
negotiating and interacting with NPCs. He may take a more active role if he suspects
an NPC has information about a treasure or about any of his other personal
interests. Otherwise, there are no restrictions for the Mercenary-- he can be
humorous and personable, introverted and serious, or arrogant and obnoxious, as
determined by the player
