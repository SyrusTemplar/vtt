Leprechauns are diminutive folk who are found in fair, green lands and enjoy
frolicking, working magic, and causing harmless mischief.
<P></P>
Rumored to be a cross between a species of halfling and a strong strain of
pixie, leprechauns are about 2 feet tall. They have pointed ears, and their noses
also come to a tapered point. About 30% of all male leprechauns have beards.
Pointed shoes, brown or green breeches, green or gray coats, and either
wide-brimmed or stocking caps are the preferred dress of the wee folk. Many leprechauns
also enjoy smoking a pipe, usually a long-stemmed one.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">These fun-loving creatures of magical talent are by nature noncombative. They
can become invisible at will, polymorph nonliving objects, create illusions
(with full audio and olfactory effects), and use <I>ventriloquism</I> spells as often as they like. Their keen ears prevent them from ever being
surprised. Being full of mischief, they often (75%) snatch valuable objects from
adventurers, turn invisible and dash away. There is a 75% chance that the
attempt is successful. If pursued closely, there is a 25% chance per turn of pursuit
that the leprechaun drops the stolen goods. The chase never leads to the
leprechaun's lair.
<P></P>
If caught or discovered in its lair (10% chance), the leprechaun attempts to
mislead his captor into believing that he is giving over his treasure while he
actually is duping the captor. It requires great care to actually obtain the
leprechaun's treasure.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Leprechauns live in families of up to 20, though they call this unit a clan.
They use first names and surnames, and it is fairly certain that these names are
a good indicator of which clan one is dealing with. A lair usually consists of
a warm, dry cave with a hearth, rugs, and furniture. Strangely, word travels
fast between clans of the same surname, and a clan that a group of adventurers
runs into may already know the adventurers' names from another clan the party
encountered several days prior.
<P></P>
There is a rumor that a King of the Leprechauns exists, but there seems to be
no official political hierarchy. There are no communities or villages of
leprechauns.
<P></P>
It is rare to see leprechaun offspring, but they do exist, born with the full
magical powers of an adult. For every 10 adults encountered in a lair, one
child will be found.
<P></P>
Leprechauns enjoy eating the same sorts of foods that humans and demihumans
eat, with a special fondness for wine. This weakness may be used to outwit them.
<P></P>
Gold is the one treasure found in every leprechaun's hoard. If an intruder
secures this treasure, a leprechaun will bargain and beg to get it back. As a last
desperate measure, he will grant the intruder three wishes (very limited), but
only if the intruder gives over the treasure first. When this is done, the
leprechaun will indeed grant the three wishes. After all three wishes, the
leprechaun will flatter the intruder and declare that the three wishes were so
well-phrased that he will give a fourth wish. If the fourth wish is pronounced, the
leprechaun will cackle with glee, the results of all the wishes will be reversed,
and the intruder plus his group will be teleported (no saving throw) to a
random location 2d20 miles away. No member of that party will never be able to find
that particular leprechaun again.
<P></P>
Leprechauns are naturally distrustful toward humans and dwarves, since these
races have greedy tendencies. They get along well with elves, gnomes, and
halflings.
<P></P>
A leprechaun will not sit idly by while a helpless creature is attacked, since
they have a soft spot for weaker creatures. In general, if a leprechaun senses
that a stranger means no harm, he can be quite civil, but he will not bring
visitors to his lair. If the leprechaun finds someone hurt, he might take the
victim to his lair, but only after making sure that the stranger is not followed
and cannot see where he is being taken.
<P></P>

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The best times and places to observe leprechauns are called borderlines. Dawn
and dusk (which are neither all light nor dark), the shore (which is neither
all earth nor all water), or the equinoxes and solstices (which are neither one
season nor another), are the best times and places to see leprechauns and their
ilk frolicking and celebrating.
