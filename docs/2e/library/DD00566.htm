The DM has accidentally pitted his player characters against a group of
creatures too powerful for them, so much so that the player characters are doomed. To
fix things, the DM can have the monsters flee in inexplicable panic; secretly
lower their hit points; allow the player characters to hit or inflict more
damage than they really should; have the monsters miss on attacks when they
actually hit; have the creatures make grievous mistakes in strategy (like ignoring the
thief moving in to strike from behind).
