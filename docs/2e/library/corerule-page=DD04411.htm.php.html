A priest casting <I>shooting stars</I> creates a violent turbulence in the air above the area of effect, from which
a number of fiery-orange, electrically-charged miniature fireballs erupt and
shower onto the ground. Within the area of effect, all creatures suffer 6d10
points of combined fire and electrical damage. A successful saving throw at a -4
penalty indicates half damage.
<P></P>
In addition, four large shooting stars materialize within the area of effect.
The priest can individually target these at specific creatures. If creatures
are not specified, the targets are randomly selected. Each shooting star causes
48 points of damage on impact (no saving throw is allowed). Any creature within
10 feet of impact suffers 24 points of fire damage (half-damage if a saving
throw at -4 is successful).
