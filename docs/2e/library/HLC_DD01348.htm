</B>True Dweomers and Quest Spells</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> As powerful as a true dweomer is, it is still mortal magic. Quest spell
effects, which represent a deity's direct intervention in the world, generally
cannot be countered by true dweomers. A dispel true dweomer is ineffective against
a quest spell effect.
<P></P>
If a quest spell produces a creature, object, or other effect that can be
attacked or destroyed by normal means or spells, a true dweomer can be used to
attack it. For example, a banish true dweomer cannot remove the creatures summoned
by a wolf spirits quest spell, but a slay or strike true dweomer can harm the
individual <I>wolf spirits</I>.
<P></P>
Ward true dweomers can work against quest spell effects if the protection is
relevant. For example, a ward that provides protection from electrical attacks
is effective against the lightning bolts generated from a <I>storm of vengeance </I>quest spell, but not the spell's other effects.
<P></P>
If the quest spell allows a saving throw, the ward works normally. If the
quest spell does not allow a saving throw, anything protected by a ward gains a
saving throw of 18. If the ward provides magic resistance, its value is halved vs.
quest spell effects.
