It's a good idea for the fighting characters (including rogues and priests) in
a party to represent a mix of weapons and combat styles. Several should be
front-line fighters, bearing heavy armor and large, damaging weapons. One or two
would be behind-the-lines fighters, carrying polearms. And one or two should be
missilers, carrying bow, crossbow, or even sling or throwing knives.
<P></P>
This gives the party a certain amount of versatility. The heavy fighters can
engage the heavy opposition. The polearm fighters can attack the enemy with
reduced risk of being hurt. The missilers should concentrate on eliminating enemy
missilers first, and then can turn their attention to doing unreturned damage to
the melee-fighting enemies.

It's especially good when characters can mix and match their roles. Any
character can have a sling or a throwing axe at his belt and become a missiler in a
matter of seconds, for example.
