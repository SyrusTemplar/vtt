feet. Any creature touched by the ray must roll successful saving throw vs. wand
or be rendered rigidly immobile for 5d4 rounds. A save indicates the ray missed,
and there is no effect. As soon as the ray touches one creature, it stopsâ€”the
wand can attack only one target per round. The wand has an initiative modifier
of +3 , and each use costs one charge. The wand may operate once per round. It
may be recharged.
