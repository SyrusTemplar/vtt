</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Bows, crossbows, and many other missile weapons have different rates of fire
(ROF)--the number of missiles they can shoot in a single round.
<P></P>
Small, light weapons can be thrown very quickly, so up to three darts can be
thrown in a single round. Arrows can be nocked and let loose almost as quickly,
so up to two shots can be fired in a single round.
<P></P>
Some weapons (such as heavy crossbows) take a long time to load and can be
fired only every other round.
<P></P>
Whatever the ROF, multiple missile shots are handled the same way as other
multiple attacks for the purposes of determining initiative. The ROF of each
missile weapon is listed in <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01625.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01625.htm.php.html">table 45</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> in Chapter 6.
