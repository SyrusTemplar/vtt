The neogi appear as a cross between a wolf spider and a moray eel. The short,
furry, eight-limbed body is topped by a lithe, bare, fleshy neck with a
serpentine head, its mouth filled with needle-sharp teeth. The ends of its limbs are
tipped with small claws. The fur of the neogi is a light tan, but dyed a variety
of colors to signify power, rank, accomplishments, and warnings to other
neogi. The older a neogi grows, the more colorful its hide becomes.
<P></P>
The neogi are ruthless slayers and plunderers, and think nothing of eating
their enemies, servants, or fallen comrades. They are a hateful, xenophobic race.
<P></P>
Neogi can communicate in their own language and in Common. Many speak 1-4
other languages to help facilitate their slaves taking orders correctly.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The neogi have a number of defenses, the first, and most obvious being their
enslavement of umber hulks (see entry). Each neogi has a personal umber hulk
slave who is a combination bodyguard, manservant, and useful set of hands. Second,
the bite of the neogi is poisonous. Those bitten and failing a saving throw
vs. poison are affected as by a <I>slow</I> spell for 1d8 rounds. Multiple bites will extend this period by an additional
1d8 rounds per bite. Lastly, 1 in 10 neogi has some magical ability, equal to
human spell use of levels 1-8.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The hated neogi are only found in very remote locations, deep beneath the
earth, or among the farthest stars. Their lives revolve around their communities
and their slaves.
<P></P>
Neogi are a slaving race with an inborn sense of property: all is either owned
or owner, slave or neogi. Even neogi are slaves to other neogi, but
slave-neogi may have their own slaves. The neogi tattoo their non-neogi slaves with
symbols of ownership, usually on the left shoulder in the front and back.
<P></P>
Captive umber hulks are trained from birth to follow their &quot;small lords,&quot;
caring for their every need. Any neogi can command another umber hulk (the effect
of this command is akin to the effect of the <I>charm monster</I> spell).
<P></P>
The neogi world view of &quot;own or be owned&quot; has resulted in a paranoid outlook
that borders on xenophobia, and their relentless attacks on other races result
in their being universally hated. The only &quot;normal&quot; race with ties to neogi are
the mind flayers, who make a profit on the neogi slave trade.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">As a neogi grows older and his mind fades, his orders become confused and his
slaves become disobedient. His fellow neogi may choose to poison the older one
at once. The different poisons moving through its body overload the old neogi's
system, and it begins its change into a Great Old Master.
<P></P>
The neogi making the transformation swells to 20 feet in height and a similar
girth. Its legs and arms become useless, and its intelligence fades; it now
lives only to eat. Live flesh is preferred, but the dead will sustain it. A Great
Old Master inflicts 1d12 points of damage per round to any creature it is fed.
<P></P>
After 2 months of eating, the skin of the Great Old Master bursts and a new
crop of mature neogi spill forth. These are unmarked and barely sentient at
birth, and for the next week the brood area resounds with combat as the young neogi
kill each other for food. Of the 20-40 neogi that eat their way out, only about
3-6 survive. These are considered slaves of the community, until such a time
as they claim an umber hulk as their personal slave.
<P></P>
If a Great Old Master is attacked and its flesh pierced, it releases 2d4 neogi
to defend itself. These are taken from the future brood, and are not replaced.
Blunt weapons will not pierce the skin and therefore do not bring forth young.
Edged or piercing weapons, or magical spells that pierce or burn, will produce
this defensive reaction.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Reaver
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">These rogue neogi have rebelled and are seeking to escape the other neogi and
their poisons that will transform them into Great Old Masters. Rogue neogi are
little better than their fellows, and are, if anything, more desperate, due to
being pursued by their former fellows, all eager to start the process of
producing more neogi.
