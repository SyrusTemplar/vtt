<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Selecting Character Disadvantages</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> When a character is created, the ability scores of that PC include inherent
advantages and disadvantages. A character will be strong or weak, fast or slow,
brilliant or stupid, handsome or ugly. These categories are general, and
players have a great deal of freedom in interpreting the numbers for their
characters.
<P></P>
Some disadvantages are more specific than these character abilities, and they
provide background for players who like to role-play. A player whose character
passionately fears spiders, or becomes tongue-tied in social situations, has
specific suggestions about role-playing.
<P></P>
At the time of character creation, a player can select one or two
disadvantages. The choice is purely optional?no character <I>must</I> have a disadvantage. Unlike traits and proficiencies, disadvantages do not
cost character points?instead, each disadvantage <I>awards</I> a certain number of points that the player can use to provide a character
with other traits, proficiencies, and racial or class abilities, or can save for
later use.
<P></P>
Some disadvantages can be chosen at one of two levels?the disadvantage of
allergies, for example, can be taken at a moderate or a severe rating. Characters
who choose the severe disadvantage will have lower chances of resisting the
effects of the disadvantage during play.
<P></P>
A character can never gain more than 15 character points by acquiring
disadvantages.
<P></P>
Certain disadvantages will contradict traits, and these cannot be selected?a
character with keen eyesight cannot choose the colorblind disadvantage, for
example. These conflicts should be judged with common sense.
