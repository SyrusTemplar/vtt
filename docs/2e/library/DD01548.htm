<TITLE>Armorer-- Nonweapon Proficiency (Player's Handbook)</TITLE>

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Armorer:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This character can make all of the types of armor listed in the <I>Player's Handbook,</I> given the proper materials and facilities. When making armor, the proficiency
check is rolled at the end of the normal construction time.
<P></P>
The time required to make armor is equal to two weeks per level of AC below
10. For example, a shield would require two weeks of work, whereas a suit of full
plate armor would require 18 weeks of work.
<P></P>
If the proficiency check indicates failure but is within 4 of the amount
needed for success, the armorer has created usable, but flawed, armor. Such armor
functions as 1 AC worse than usual, although it looks like the armor it was
intended to be. Only a character with armorer proficiency can detect the flaws, and
this requires careful and detailed inspection.
<P></P>
If the flawed armor is struck in melee combat with a natural die roll of 19 or
20, it breaks. The character's AC immediately worsens by 4 additional classes
(although never above 10), and the broken armor hampers the character's
movement. Until the character can remove the broken armor (a process requiring 1d4
rounds), the character moves at Â½ of his normal rate and suffers a -4 penalty to
all of his attack rolls.
<P></P>
If an armorer is creating a suit of field plate or full plate armor, the
character who will use the armor must be present at least once a week during the
creation of the armor, since such types of armor require very exact fitting.
