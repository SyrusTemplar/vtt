With this spell, the wild mage creates a negative pattern in the random forces
surrounding one creature. The creature is allowed a saving throw; if
successful, the spell fails. If the saving throw is failed, random chance falls into an
unlucky pattern. Any action involving random chance (i.e., any time a die roll
affects the character) performed by the victim during the next 2-20 rounds
requires two separate attempts; the worse result is always applied. (The victim
rolls twice for attacks, damages, saving throws, etc., always using the worse die
roll.)
<P></P>
A <I>luckstone</I> or similar magical device will negate <I>unluck</I>. Doing so, however, prevents the magical item from functioning for 2d10
rounds.
<P></P>
The material component is a piece of a broken mirror.
