<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Like fighters and rangers, paladins may
establish and maintain castles, forts, temples, and other types of
strongholds. But a paladin's stronghold is more than a residence. It
serves as a monument to his principles, a tribute to his deity, and a
symbol of his lifetime of service. It can function as a military
base, administrative office, religious sanctuary, prison, treasure
house, or training center. It may also generate a modest income from
agricultural products, taxes, or rents.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A paladin may acquire land at any point
in his career, but he must be at least 9th level before he can
establish a stronghold. Paladins of lower levels lack reputation and
contacts, and rarely have the monetary resources needed for
construction costs and upkeep.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Even at 9th level, however, a paladin
should proceed with caution. A stronghold requires an enormous
commitment of time and money. Often, a paladin must oversee a staff
of workers and a garrison of soldiers, most of them expecting regular
salaries. A paladin may face staggering costs for routine
maintenance, which he dare not neglect&#151;a shabby building
reflects badly on his reputation and may also be a punishable
violation of his ethos (see Chapter 3).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If a paladin decides to take the plunge,
he must determine the location of his intended stronghold, its size
and design, and its purpose. Will it be his main home or an
occasional residence? Is the generation of income a primary
consideration? Will the general public have access, or will it be
open only to a select few? How much can he afford to invest? Are the
officials of his government and church supportive or discouraging?
Will they help with manpower, loans, or supplies?</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no fixed procedure for
establishing a stronghold, but the following steps are usually
involved. For more information, particularly regarding costs and
layouts, consult DMGR2 <I>The Castle Guide</I>.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Permission</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If a paladin has strong ties to a
government or church, he must petition the proper officials for
permission to build a stronghold. In most cases, the officials want
to know the paladin's plans in detail, particularly the proposed
stronghold's size, design, and function. The officials may demand an
accounting of the paladin's economic status, including his net worth,
projected income, and current debts.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If the paladin has a solid reputation and
answers their questions satisfactorily, the officials usually grant
permission, contingent on a few conditions. For instance, the paladin
may have to agree to live in the stronghold for a minimum number of
months per year or pay an annual maintenance tax (in addition to his
normal tithing requirements). He may be held personally responsible
for the debts of all workers in his employ. Further, the officials
may demand the right to use his stronghold for military purposes in
times of war. Finally, they may insist on a signed statement that
permanently turns the stronghold over to them should the paladin
violate the conditions of their agreement.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Land Acquisition</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Paladins usually acquire the land for
their strongholds through grants or charters awarded by government or
church officials. A <I>charter </I>allows the paladin to administer
the land more or less as he sees fit, with the officials retaining
ownership. Chartered land often lies outside the jurisdiction of the
government or church, meaning that the paladin may have to defend
against ownership challenges from other claimants.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Monarchs sometimes award property in the
form of a <I>benefice</I>; that is, the paladin manages the property
as he sees fit in exchange for a promise of military service. Though
the monarchy technically retains ownership of the property, the
paladin keeps all the money from farming and other profit-making
endeavors. The charter remains valid as long as the paladin meets his
military obligations. Additionally, the monarchy agrees to provide
soldiers to help defend the stronghold, and to refrain from
interfering in the paladin's management decisions.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A <I>grant</I> transfers legal ownership
directly and unequivocally to the paladin. The best grant is an
outright gift, given to recognize a noteworthy career, or as a reward
for a military victory or some other act of exceptional service. A <I>homestead
grant</I> gives ownership of a piece of land to the paladin after
he's lived and worked there for a predetermined period (typically,
5-10 years). When a monarch awards a grant, he also specifies what
will happen to the land when the paladin dies. A <I>reversion</I>
arrangement returns the property to the king (or to whomever the land
previously belonged). A <I>perpetuity grant</I> entitles the paladin
to name an heir to inherit his land, usually his successor.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of charters and grants, a
paladin usually takes whatever land he can get. A paladin wanting
more say in the type and size of his land should consider other
options. He may, for instance, petition his liege for ownership of a
conquered land; that is, a portion of a territory confiscated from an
enemy army or a property liberated from a heretical priesthood.
Affluent or well-connected paladins may buy their land or negotiate a
lease, paying a fixed sum each month that goes toward the purchase
price. Land values vary wildly, but a paladin can expect to pay from
50-200 gold pieces per acre for undeveloped property in a good
climate within reasonable distance of a civilized community.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A paladin may also be responsible for a <I>regency</I>
or <I>trust</I>, a locale that he neither owns nor occupies. As
directed by his government or church, the paladin oversees the locale
and makes all management decisions, including hiring employees and
maintaining defenses.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Site Location</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Paladins should choose the site of their
strongholds with an eye towards defensive advantages, convenience,
and hidden costs. A stronghold in a valley is more difficult to
defend that one at the top of a hill. Access to a river makes a moat
easier to fill. Forests provide lumber for buildings and fruit for
nourishment. Land in a city may be more expensive than in a small
village, but labor and materials may be easier to procure. If the
paladin wants to farm, or if he eventually plans to expand, he should
buy as much land as he needs at the outset, rather than waiting until
he builds his stronghold and drives up the value of the adjacent property.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Paladins lacking the resources to buy
land or the patience to wait for a grant may wish to settle in an
unclaimed wilderness. If the paladin has strong ties to a government
or church, he may be required to claim such land for his superiors.
However, if the land is sufficiently remote and has no obvious
military or economic value, the claim may just be a formality; his
superiors may let him have it without any conditions. Of course, if
the paladin has no ties to a government or church, he may be eligible
to claim the land for himself.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Though wilderness strongholds bring
independence, they also bring problems. Should an enemy army lay
siege, the paladin can't turn to his government for help. He's on his
own to defend against monsters and claim-jumpers. He may have a hard
time finding medicine, food, and other supplies. Damage from forest
fires and other natural disasters may be difficult to contain.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Design</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Stronghold designs range from small
fortresses (essentially, fortified houses) to ornate castles with
multiple buildings and elaborate defenses. Budgetary and ethical
considerations, however, usually restrict paladins to modest layouts.
If a paladin wants to spend more than 150,000 gp or so on a
stronghold (see &quot;Time and Money'' below), he must petition his
deity for permission. If the paladin's intentions are
honorable&#151;for instance, if the stronghold is intended to honor
the deity or to provide jobs for destitute peasants&#151;permission
will probably be granted. Because of his commitment to austerity
(discussed in Chapter 3), a paladin will <I>never</I> establish a
dominion or empire.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever practical, a paladin's
stronghold includes the following components:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bailey.</B> This is an open courtyard
surrounded by a protective wall. The bailey is usually circular or
rectangular, although the exact shape depends on the terrain.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep.</B> The stronghold's primary
structure, a keep is a rectangular or cylindrical building with thick
stone walls, rising 50-80 feet high. The keep is the main residence
of the paladin, his family, and his closest aides. It also serves as
a storage area and as emergency housing for workers and soldiers
should intruders breech the stronghold wall.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Other stronghold buildings may include
warehouses, barracks, barns, and workshops. These buildings are made
of wood or stone, ranging in size from 20 feet &#165; 20 feet to 40
feet &#165; 80 feet. Most are ground level; a few may have two
stories. The buildings may be arranged in small clusters or linked by
covered passageways to form one continuous structure.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Moat.</B> This is a ditch filled with
water or mud that encircles the stronghold wall. To deter intruders,
a moat should be at least 10 feet wide and 10 feet deep.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Protective Wall.</B> Typically, the
outer wall of the stronghold is 15-50 feet tall and at least 10 feet
thick. The wall is made of stone, often reinforced with sections of
metal or wood. A protruding entryway, called a <I>barbican</I>,
consists of two stone towers, about 20-30 feet high and spaced 20-40
feet apart. A wooden gate reinforced with metal bars sits between the
towers. A small building called a <I>gatehouse</I> may be positioned
next to the gate; gatehouse guards monitor the comings and goings of
stronghold visitors. To allow passage over the moat, the guards lower
a drawbridge, consisting of a broad wooden platform connected by
chains to a crank. The entry may be further protected by a sliding
metal lattice called a <I>portcullis</I>, raised and lowered by
pulleys and ropes.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; An open parapet called a<I> battlement</I>
rises from the outer wall. Defenders of the stronghold stand behind
the battlement to protect themselves from enemy missiles. Some
battlements extend over the protective wall, allowing defenders to
hurl stones or splash hot oil on invaders through holes in the floor.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Temple.</B> Next to the keep, the
temple (or shrine, cathedral, or church, as appropriate to the
paladin's faith) is the stronghold's most imposing structure. The
temple is usually made of stone, cylindrical or rectangular in shape,
and adjacent or directly attached to the keep. Paladins prefer ornate
temples, and any surplus funds in the budget usually go towards
additional furnishings, decorations, and architectural flourishes.
Rock gardens and friezes are typical; statuary, fountains, and
ornamental roofs are less common but highly desirable.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Towers.</B> Several stone towers stand
along the walls, each about 30 feet or so tall. Square towers are
less sturdy and more costly than round towers, but are easier to
build. Soldiers stand on the tower roofs, protected by parapets, and
throw spears and rocks at invaders. From inside the tower, they fire
arrows through narrow slits in the walls.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Time and Money</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Paladin strongholds aren't cheap. The
costs of three configurations are listed below; the prices include
labor but exclude the land.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Small.</B> A fortified tower (which
serves as a keep) enclosed by a protective wall, along with one or
two small storage buildings and worker dormitories. Cost:
40,000-60,000 gp.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Medium.</B> A modest villa or fort
consisting of a 50-foot keep, surrounded by a moat and a protective
wall, with a small temple, one or two stone towers, and a few
auxiliary buildings. Cost: 80,000-120,000 gp.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Large.</B> A modest castle, including
an 80-foot keep, an attached temple, a 50-foot protective wall (with
a battlement), a moat, three or more towers, and several auxiliary
buildings (barns, worker dormitories, storehouses). Cost: 130,000-170,000
gp.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Ornate designs (including high-quality
materials or works of art), difficult working conditions (a lack of
adequate workers or excessive rain), and unexpected setbacks (a wall
collapses or a rot mold infects the local lumber supply) can increase
the price from 50-100%. On the other hand, a good break can lower
costs. For instance, a sympathetic monarch may donate labor, or a
mine owner may make a deal on stone purchased in quantity. In any
case, the DM has the final say on construction costs, as well as any
circumstances that affect the final price.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; To estimate the number of days required
to build a stronghold, divide the total cost of the stronghold by
1,000 and multiply the result by 1d4. For example, building a castle
costing 100,000 gp takes 100-400 days. Keep in mind, however, that a
production schedule seldom proceeds without interruption. Supply
shortages, bad weather, sick and injured workers, and monster attacks
can double or even triple the time required. Even a modest castle may
take several years to complete.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Staff</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Running even the smallest stronghold
requires more attention than the paladin alone can supply. A loyal
staff&#151;composed of workers, soldiers, and a few trained
specialists&#151;is necessary to handle the stronghold's day-to-day
operations and provide a strong defense.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Securing a staff is especially
complicated for a paladin, since he doesn't attract a body of
followers like other fighters. Further, a paladin may hire only
persons of lawful good alignment, limiting the pool of potential hirelings.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of these restrictions, a paladin
may be tempted to skimp on his staff. But he does so at great risk.
The stronghold may fall into disrepair without a sufficient number of
workers, devaluing the property and inviting reprimands from the
paladin's liege or church. An inadequate defense encourages raids
from bandits, monsters, and hostile armies. Without a skilled
steward, the paladin must supervise the stronghold's daily routines.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A paladin may begin his search for
employees by making inquiries in local inns, posting notices, and
asking for referrals from other landlords. Though interest may be
limited at first, the number of applicants is likely to increase as
word spreads of the paladin's reputation for honesty and generosity.
In general, a suitable candidate for a particular job may show up
every week or so; a paladin can expect to spend at least two or three
months to hire a staff of 12.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; It's up to the paladin to screen all
applicants, weeding out incompetent workers and potential
troublemakers. Most important, he must ascertain each applicant's
alignment by asking pointed questions (Have you ever been arrested?
Have you ever been reprimanded by your church?), requesting
references (military service records and recommendations from
previous employers), and conducting simple tests of honesty (the
paladin leaves a gold coin on the floor, then leaves the room; will
the applicant pocket the coin or return it?). If the paladin doubts
the applicant's alignment for any reason, it's in his best interests
to reject the applicant on the spot. If an employee later reveals an
alignment other than lawful good, the paladin must dismiss him;
additionally, the paladin may face penalties for violating his ethos
(see Chapter 3).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If convinced of the applicant's integrity
and skills, the paladin then makes a formal offer, spelling out the
duties of the job, the salary, all benefits, opportunities for
promotion, and the term of employment. If the terms are agreeable to
the applicant, he accepts the job. Alternately, the DM may roll
secretly for the applicant's reaction on Table 26. If the interview
went exceptionally well for both parties, modify the roll by +1. If
the paladin made an unusually generous offer, modify the roll by
another +1.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; How big a staff is needed? That depends
on the size of the stronghold, the type of operation (farm workers
are needed if the stronghold produces crops), and its location (more
soldiers may be necessary in hostile territory). The paladin must
also consider his financial health; workers won't stick around if he
can't meet the monthly payroll. It may take a bit of trial and error
before the paladin settles on the optimum size and composition of his
staff. Table 27 lists suggested staff sizes for small, medium, and
