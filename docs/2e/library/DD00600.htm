Locating a capable NPC is the first step. Not all NPCs advertise their
abilities; this is especially true in the case of spellcasters. Bragging that one is
the great and powerful wizard Wazoo can be bad for one's health. There is always
a young hot-shot who will take the claim as a challenge. (Sort of like the Old
West, where there was always someone itching to beat the fastest gun...)

For this reason, spellcasters tend to be mysterious or, at least, quiet about
their abilities. Churches, temples, and other holy places tend to be the best
places to look since clerics have some obligation to proclaim the powers of
their deity openly.
