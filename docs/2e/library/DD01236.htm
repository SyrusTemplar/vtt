<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The ecology is wildly different from the base campaign in almost every way;
the environment is deadly (poisonous, airless, acidic, etc.). Living creatures,
if they exist at all, are barely recognizable as such.

<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The ecology is different from the base campaign in most ways; the environment
is hostile (very cold, waterless, flooded with x-rays, etc.). Living creatures
have completely alien forms.
<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">4
<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The ecology is similar to the base campaign. The environment is fairly
livable, but some vital element is absent or incompatible. The PCs cannot survive over
the long term without a large stock of supplies from their home world or
magical aid (can’t eat the food, water makes PCs drunk, etc.). Overall conditions
may be hostile, such as boiling daytime temperatures, subzero nighttime
temperatures, acid rain, etc. One or more intelligent races resemble some nonhumanoid or
monstrous species (insects, serpents, fungi, etc.).

<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The ecology is similar to the base campaign. The environment is livable, but
some vital element is absent or incompatible. The PCs cannot survive over the
long term without a large stock of supplies from their home world or magical aid
(can’t eat the food, water makes PCs drunk, etc.). Overall conditions may be
severe, such as a global desert, ice age, endless rain, etc. One or more

<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The ecology is similar to the base campaign. The environment is livable, but
some important element is absent or incompatible. The PCs may find the
conditions inconvenient, but their long-term survival is not in jeopardy (little or no
metal, thin atmosphere, sunless sky, etc.). Overall conditions may be severe,
such as a global desert, ice age, endless rain, etc. One or more intelligent
races resembles some nonhumanoid or monstrous species (insects, felines, dragons,
etc.).

<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Ecology and environment is almost identical to the base campaign. All major
races and species are present, but not all races have the same level of

<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">15
<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Ecology and environment are almost identical to the base campaign. All major

<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Ecology is very similar to the base campaign, and the environment is generally
favorable (completely tropical, rains according to a predictable schedule,
most plants edible, etc.). Most races and species from the base campaign are

feathered snakes with iridescent plumage, or birds who sing highly musical songs.
