and arrangement of the human body, including the location and function of bones,
muscles, organs, and other soft tissues. This skill has two distinct uses for a
wizard; first of all, knowledge of anatomy provides the character with a +2
bonus on any healing proficiency checks he attempts. Secondly, the wizard can use
this skill to repair corpses that have been badly damaged. With a successful
proficiency check, the wizard can strengthen and reinforce a body, making it
more suitable for animation as a mindless undead. This provides a hit point bonus
of +1 per die for skeletal remains, or a bonus of +2 hp per die for a creature
to be animated as a zombie.
