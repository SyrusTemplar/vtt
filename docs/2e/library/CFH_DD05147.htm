<B>Description:</B> The samurai is a warrior from cultures based on the medieval Japanese
civilization. He lives by a very strict code of honor and behavior, a code demanding:
absolute obedience to his lord; readiness to die for honor or for his lord at
any time; eagerness to avenge any dishonor to his lord, his family, or himself;
willingness to repay all debts honorably; and unwillingness to demonstrate the
most dishonorable trait of cowardice.
<P></P>
Samurai must have minimum scores of 13 in Strength, Wisdom, and Constitution,
and of 14 in Intelligence. They may be of lawful alignment only (but still may
be good, evil, or neutral).
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> In a campaign, unless the campaign itself is set in an eastern culture, the
Samurai is present to provide a touch of the exotic (culture clashes are always
very interesting in a campaign); it also allows for a variety of warrior who
can be tremendously deadly.
<P></P>
A samurai can fall from his noble position within a greater lord's household.
It may be that the house has perished in a war or other calamity, or that the
samurai's lord has rejected him, or ordered him to commit suicide and the
samurai has refused, or that the samurai has left his lord for some other point of
honor. Regardless, the samurai is now masterless; he is called <I>ronin</I>. The ronin has all of the abilities of the samurai, but operates under
slightly different rules, as you will see below. With your DM's permission, you can
create your character as a ronin instead of a samurai. A samurai can become a
ronin at any time in a campaign; likewise, by swearing allegiance to a lord who
will have him, a ronin can become a samurai again.
<P></P>
Before you create a samurai or ronin character, ask your DM if such things
exist on his world and if you may play one. It could be that the DM does not wish
to allow samurai and ronin in his campaign (because the campaign world has no
oriental setting to act as their origin, for instance).
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> A samurai or ronin must have the Scribe secondary skill.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> The samurai and ronin start play with two free extra weapon proficiency
slots—that's the good news. The bad news is that, of his <I>six</I> initial weapon proficiencies, <I>five</I> are chosen for him. The samurai and ronin must specialize in katana* (samurai
sword, two proficiency slots) and daikyu* (samurai great bow, three
proficiency slots). The samurai or ronin may spend his last proficiency slot as he
chooses—but only from among the samurai weapons listed in the <I>Equipment</I> chapter of this book. (The &quot;*&quot; symbol indicates a new weapon to be found in
the <I>Equipment</I> chapter.) After the character is in play in another culture, he may become
proficient in weapons of that other culture.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Bonus Proficiencies: Etiquette, Riding (Land-Based). Required (samurai/ronin
must purchase these, but gets no extra slots to pay for them): (Priest and
Wizard, costs double slots unless Paladin or Ranger) Reading/Writing. Recommended:
General—Artistic Ability/Calligraphy, Artistic Ability/Painting, (Warrior)
Blind-Fighting, Running.
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> The samurai and ronin must buy all their starting equipment from the samurai
weapons, armor and equipment listed in the <I>Equipment</I> chapter. They may have no more than 10 gp left when they have purchased their
equipment. Samurai and ronin <I>do not</I> have to buy their katana; that is free to the character.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> The samurai and ronin are able to focus their vital energies to increase
their Strength score—temporarily. Once per day per experience level, the samurai or
ronin can increase his Strength to 18/00. This lasts for one full round, and
must be preceded by a loud <I>kiai</I> shout (making it impossible for him to summon this strength silently or
stealthily). For that one round, all his hit probability, damage adjustment, weight
allowance, maximum press, open doors, and bend bars/lift gates rolls and
functions are calculated as if his Strength were 18/00.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> The samurai and ronin have different special hindrances. The <I>samurai</I> is (supposed to be) absolutely devoted to his lord. He is expected instantly
to obey every one of his lord's orders, up to and including killing himself or
those he loves. If he refuses to obey an order, he is dishonored and is
expected to kill himself. (If he does not, he becomes ronin.) The DM should make sure
that the samurai is acutely aware of this by having his lord occasionally issue
orders which are difficult for him to keep. This doesn't always have to be
&quot;Kill all of your allies,&quot; but the lord can issue orders which interfere with the
samurai's personal goals and remind him that he is subservient to his lord.
The <I>ronin</I> has his own great difficulty: He earns experience points at half the normal
rate. When the DM awards the characters their experience, the ronin receives
only half what he would if he were still a samurai. This particular hindrance goes
away when the character once again swears allegiance to a lord and becomes a
samurai. (Of course, once he's a samurai again, he is subject to the hindrances
of the samurai.)
<P></P>
<B>Wealth Options:</B> The samurai and ronin start with the normal 5d4x10 gp beginning money.
<P></P>
<B>Races:</B> The historical precedent for the samurai is strictly human, so it's up to the
individual DM if he wants to have an oriental-based demihuman culture with a
samurai warrior class. Such a thing is perhaps most visually appropriate to
elves and half-elves, but a DM could allow it to any demihuman race in his campaign.
<P></P>
Note: Players and Dms wishing to have more game-oriented information on the
samurai should read<I> Oriental Adventures</I>, an <I>AD&amp;D®</I> game supplement dealing exclusively with the topic of eastern campaigns. Your
DM may adapt anything he chooses to use from that supplement to <I>AD&amp;D® 2nd Edition</I> game rules and statistics. The samurai presented here is a simplified version
of the <I>OA</I> samurai.
