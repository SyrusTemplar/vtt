</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> In literature, horrific and vile villains are often physically marked with
some sort of extremely noticeable and distinguishing disability (in addition to
their stereotypical tendency to always dress in black, representative of the
darkness that lurks within their twisted souls). The hunchbacked Richard III, for
instance, was universally hated and reviled because of his deformity. To
Shakespeare, this alteration of the King’s form became synonymous with malignant
villainy. Symbolically, a physical deformity was viewed as mirror of an individual’s
inner self or interpreted as a form of divine punishment for a dreadful sin.
In this way, warts became forever associated with witches.

Modern writers about necromancy have continued with this allegorical
convention. The necromancers of Clark Ashton Smith, for instance, are so powerfully evil
that their baneful nature is painfully apparent to all around them, as if the
corrupt wizards radiated a palpable aura of malevolence. Normal acts of
kindness, such as a smile or laughter, become perverted into frightening glimpses of
their twisted nature.
