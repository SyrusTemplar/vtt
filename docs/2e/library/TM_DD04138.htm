Metamagic is a special term used by erudite and educated wizards to describe a
single class of spells and magical items--those powers that alter or affect
other magical spells and items. Met a magic spells do not directly affect people,
objects, or events. Instead, the powers of metamagic are used to alter the
fabric of spells themselves. Through metamagic spells, such as <I>far reaching</I> or <I>squaring the circle</I>, the once inviolable limits of a spell can be altered. Range, duration,
casting time, area of effect, and even sound and color can be tailored through the
use of metamagical spells.

Although the concept of metamagic has existed since the beginning of magical
study, it has generally been ignored by most wizards, who have been far more
interested in spectacular effects and immediate results. However, a few
independent researchers have continued to explore and expand this esoteric field of
study.
