A character with this personality has a drive to accomplish a particular
self-appointed mission. All his personal efforts must go toward its fulfillment; he
feels guilty if he has to devote time to other activities.
<P></P>
A fanatic believes the ends justify the means. Anyone and anything could
become a sacrifice to the cause. One can inject fanaticism into any druid character
by exaggerating the normal behavior of his branch or kit. Possible fanatics
include the characters below:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> Druids with the Avenger kit may seek revenge for the defilement of a
particular area of wilderness.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> Village Druids may act fanatically in defense of their villages, seeing all
outsiders as potential threats and ruthlessly destroying anyone who harms &quot;my
people.&quot;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> Guardian druids can have a fanatical bent toward preserving the area under
their protection. They have been heard to say things like, &quot;You may travel through
my forest, but if you cut even one living branch for firewood, damage one
single leaf, or kill the smallest animal, you will regret it!&quot;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>路</SPAN></FONT> Druids with any kit may act like fanatics about duties to the Order, taking
extreme actions against anyone who harms the wilderness. This kind of druid often
adopts the viewpoint of the Shadow Circle.
<P></P>
The fanatic archetype does not normally suit a PC, but this personality can
make an interesting NPC. In particular, fanatics make good rivals for more
moderate druids, who work to rein in the excesses of extremists to maintain the
Order's good name.
