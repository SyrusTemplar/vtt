A character recovers from Temporary Damage at a rate of 1 hit point every five
minutes. If Temporary Damage has caused a character to go unconscious, he'll
recover consciousness when he returns to 1 hit point or more.
<P></P>
<I>Example: Amstard, above, took 11 points of damage before he was knocked out.
He'll recover one point of damage every 5 minutes. After 55 minutes, he'll be as
healthy as he can be until his Normal Damage is also healed up. However, since
it wasn't the Temporary Damage he took that knocked him out, but a Knockout
result from a Punching attack, he won't wake up from recovery of Temporary
Damage; recovery from Knockout is handled differently.</I>
