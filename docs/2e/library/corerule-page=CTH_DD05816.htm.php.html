<I>Description:</I> Though Investigators are listed as thieves, they are usually in fact the
antithesis of criminals. Investigators are enforcers of law and order, the people
who know the skills of the thief intimately so that they can combat him.
<P></P>
<I>Role: </I>Investigators can play a number of roles. They may be private, their services
for sale. Or they may be employed by a government or organization. In each case
their skills and activities are similar, but their roles and attitudes may be
divergent.
<P></P>
An Investigator may be a vigilante, obsessed with uncovering crime wherever it
may be hiding, and stopping it. Or he may be the &quot;private eye,&quot; a mercenary
sort, or retained by an individual or organization, and may be willing to
sidestep laws to better serve his client.
<P></P>
Some Investigators are of course in the employ of some government. This does
not necessarily identify them as good, however. An Investigator may be portrayed
as a sort of &quot;good guy cop,&quot; if it suits the campaign. But if the players are
running thieves (especially folk hero types), the Investigator could be
sinister and evil, a perfect foil to the PC thieves' capers.
<P></P>
The relationship between Investigator thieves and guilds is not usually that
of allies. An Investigator might be employed by a guild, however; though usually
a Spy, or perhaps a Troubleshooter, would do the guild's &quot;investigating.&quot;
<P></P>
In fact, an Investigator might not even realize that he is employed by a
guild, if his ostensible employer is a &quot;front&quot; business. Interesting
cloak-and-dagger-style adventures could be built around an Investigator discovering, in the
course of his work, that the shadow he is following actually lurks behind his own
employer.
<P></P>
And of course, Investigators ostensibly employed by the government, like other
magistrates and officials, sometimes &quot;go bad,&quot; and are bought off by a guild,
either for information, or in exchange for a blind eye turned toward guild
activities.
<P></P>
<I>Secondary Skills: Any</I> are possible, though it is not unusual for an Investigator to have spent his
entire adult life in this profession. Among the most useful secondary skills
for this kit are armorer, gambler, jeweler, limner/painter, scribe,
trader/barterer, and weaponsmith.
<P></P>
<I>Weapon Proficiencies:</I> Investigators are permitted the normal range of weapons open to thieves. They
will normally carry two weapons, at least one of them concealed (knife,
dagger, or something similarly small, perhaps in a wrist sheath).
<P></P>
<I> Nonweapon Proficiencies:</I> Required: Information Gathering, Observation. Recommended: Alertness,
Appraising, Disguise, Fast-Talking, Heraldry, Intimidation, Local History, Modern
Languages, Reading Lips, Religion, Trailing.
<P></P>
<I>Skill Progression:</I> A balance of generalized skills serves Investigators well. Picking pockets is
less important, of course, although you must remember that it may be useful
for sleight-of-hand, which may serve an Investigator. Read language skills are a
must for deciphering clues; some criminals write important information in
obscure languages or secret codes, and being able to decipher it may mean success or
failure for the Investigator. Other skills (lockpicking, trap detection and
disarmament, and so on) are useful for penetrating and examining the hideouts and
houses of suspects.
<P></P>
<I>Equipment: </I>A lot of the technological devices available to the modern Investigator (such
as fingerprinting techniques, searches of computer databases for information,
and so forth) would of course not be available in the medieval fantasy setting.
Still, it may be possible to duplicate some of the effects of such devices with
magical items; or the DM can make liberal use of anachronism. Suppose
Investigators are able to dust for fingerprints, for example. A magical device that
identifies fingerprints might also exist, allowing the Investigator to learn whose
prints he has dusted.
<P></P>
<I>Special Benefits:</I> None.
<P></P>
<I>Special Hindrances:</I> None.
<P></P>
<I>Races: </I>Investigators may be of any race, though they probably should be of the
dominant race in their area of operation. A dwarf would probably be best at doing
investigative work in the dwarf-dominated quarter of a large city, for instance.
This means that most Investigators would be human (a reasonable enough
assumption, since human governments would be the ones to use them most frequently).
Operations that investigate guilds with many nonhuman members could of course make
much use of nonhuman Investigators.
