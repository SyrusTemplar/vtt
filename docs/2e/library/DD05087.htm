<B>Animal Spy</B> (Divination)
<P></P>
<P></P>
Sphere: Animal
<P></P>
Range: 10 yards
<P></P>
Components: V, S
<P></P>
Duration: 1 turn/2 levels of caster
<P></P>
Casting Time: 5
<P></P>
Area of Effect: 1 animal
<P></P>
Saving Throw: Wizard familiars may save vs. spell to negate.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Only a normal (real-world) animal or a giant version of a normal animal
species may become an animal spy. This spell enables the caster to share the animal's
senses--see through the animal's eyes, hear with its ears, smell with its
nose, and so on. The animal is completely unaware of the spell's effect, unless the
druid warns the beast before casting. <I>Animal spy</I> grants no control over the creature. However, most casters will use it on a
trained animal or one befriended via the <I>animal friendship</I> spell.
<P></P>
For the duration of the spell, the caster remains in a trance, unable to move
or use human senses. This consequence can prove dangerous; for instance,
characters attacked while using the spell cannot feel injuries to their bodies.
However, at the start of any round, the caster may choose to return the animal's
senses to the creature and resume control of the human body. This decision ends
the spell immediately. The spell also ends if the animal travels more than 100
yards away per level of the caster.

<P></P>
Beastspite</B> (Enchantment/Charm)
<P></P>
<P></P>
Sphere: Animal
<P></P>
Range: 10 yards
<P></P>
Components: V, S
<P></P>
Duration: 1 hour/level of caster
<P></P>
Casting Time: 5
<P></P>
Area of Effect: 1 person
<P></P>
Saving Throw: Neg.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Beastspite</I> afflicts a single person with a magical aura that induces one species of
animal to hate and fear the character. The character becomes loathed by any species
of normal (real-world) animal. While this range excludes monsters, it includes
giant animals of the same real-world species. (For example, if <I>beastspite</I> causes bats to hate the subject, giant bats will react similarly.)
<P></P>
When the character comes within 30 yards of an animal from the target species,
the creature will make warning signals (barks, growls, etc.). Its further
reaction depends on the animal's nature.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Aggressive animals, including all predators and most trained guard animals,
attack the spell recipient.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Nonaggressive beasts shun the character, fleeing or attacking if approached.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Owners can restrain their domesticated animals, but the beasts show obvious
distress and may become very hostile if the character tries to touch them.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> If the subject was riding when the spell took effect, the mount tries to throw
off the character. The subject must make a riding proficiency check each round
to stay astride and to avoid a fall if thrown off.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> An animal extremely loyal to the subject, such as a pet dog, a creature
influenced by an <I>animal friendship</I> spell, a wizard's familiar, or a paladin's war horse does not become utterly
hostile to its owner. Instead it notices something &quot;wrong&quot; about the character
and acts unusually nervous.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Fortifying Stew </B>(Necromancy)
<P></P>
<P></P>
Sphere: Healing
<P></P>
Range: Touch
<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>
Duration: Stew retains enchantment 1 turn
<P></P>
Casting Time: 5
<P></P>
Area of Effect: 1 bowl of stew, etc./level
<P></P>
Saving Throw: None
<P></P>
<P></P>
Any bowl of broth, porridge, or stew the priest has concocted can become
subject to <I>fortifying stew</I>. A character can enchant one bowl of stew (about 8 ounces) per experience
level. Someone must consume the enchanted meal within one turn of the casting.
<P></P>
Anyone partaking of an entire bowlful reaps magical benefits. First, the diner
gains nourishment for an entire day from the single meal. In addition, for two
hours plus one round per the caster's level, the character receives 1d4+1
temporary hit points. Any damage suffered comes off the extra hit points first. The
effects of multiple helpings of <I>fortifying stew</I> are not cumulative.
<P></P>
For example, Snapdragon, a 7th-level druid, cooks a meaty broth, casts <I>fortifying stew</I> on it, and eats the bowlful. A roll of 2 gives her 3 extra hit points. When
the spell's effects wear off just over three hours, she loses these extra
points. If she suffers 5 points of damage in the meantime, she actually loses only 2
hp of her own, since 3 hp came off the extra hit points.
<P></P>
The material component is a vial of stock made of the first fruit of the
harvest.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Gift of Speech</B> (Enchantment/Charm)
<P></P>
<P></P>
Sphere: Animal
<P></P>
Range: 10 yards/level of caster
<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>
Duration: 1 turn/level of caster
<P></P>
Casting Time: 5
<P></P>
Area of Effect: 1 animal
<P></P>
Saving Throw: None
<P></P>
<P></P>
The <I>gift of speech</I> spell grants a normal animal (or a giant version of a normal animal) the
ability to speak any <I>one </I>of the languages the caster knows, whichever the caster chooses, along with
the ability to understand words and simple concepts expressed in that language.
The affected animal's reactions do not change, nor does its Intelligence
increase. The spell has no effect if cast on a creature with an Intelligence score of
less than 1.
<P></P>
The material component of this spell is the priest;s holy symbol.
