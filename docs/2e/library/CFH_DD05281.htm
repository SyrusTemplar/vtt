It's simple to record these injuries.
<P></P>
You don't record the damage separately. All the hit-point losses are applied
against the character's normal pool of hit points, just as before.
<P></P>
On the Combat Sheet provided at the end of this chapter, or on a
scratch-sheet, you'll want to record any special combat results and how long they're in
effect. For example: &quot;Right arm useless until combat over.&quot;
