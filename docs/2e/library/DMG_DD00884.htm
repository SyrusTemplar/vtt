<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Boccob's Blessed Book:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This well-made tome is always of small size. One will typically be no more
than 12 inches tall, 6 inches wide, and 1 inch thick?some are a mere 6 inches in
height. All such books are durable, waterproof, iron- and silver-bound, and
locked. Copies of <I>Boccob's blessed book</I> gain a +3 bonus on their saving throws (as &quot;leather or book&quot;).
<P></P>
The pages of such a book accept magic spells scribed upon them, and any book
can contain up to 45 spells of any level. The book is thus highly prized by
wizards of all sorts as a traveling spell book. It is unlikely that such a libram
will ever be discovered (randomly) with spells already inscribed?inscribed or
partially inscribed works of this nature are kept carefully by their owners.
