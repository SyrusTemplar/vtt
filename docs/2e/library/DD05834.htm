This chapter sets out to understand first what benefits a PC thief will derive
from membership in a thieves' guild, and what responsibilities and duties he
will have in return. This is a good place to start, for two reasons. First, it
briefs the DM on luring the PC into guild membership so that instead of being
onerous, it becomes interesting and rewarding. Dragooning a PC thief into guild
membership isn't as good as the lure of the carrot (with the threat of the stick
in the background . . . ). Second, in looking at the &quot;rights and
responsibilities&quot; guild members have, many of the functions of the thieves' guild?its <I>raisons d'etre</I>?become clear in the process. This helps to show why such guilds exist.
<P></P>
This matter?what thieves' guilds do?is developed further in the next major
section. The activities of the guild are divided into core functions?what almost
all guilds will do?and secondary ones. Secondary functions may be carried out or
wholly avoided, depending on the guild in question. These various activities
are laid out for the DM here to make guild-designing easier later on. Players
may also get ideas for sneaky and nefarious behaviors for their PCs here. Many
&quot;secondary functions&quot; will relate to the specialized thief kits presented
earlier. This section does not make explicit use of these kits, since different DMs
will wish to handle these differently. However, developing specialist NPCs to
fulfill these specialized activities is greatly facilitated by using the kits.
<P></P>
Next, the relation of a thieves' guild with other groups is considered. These
can vary from minimal to very highly organized indeed. The DM is briefed on
major associations (with merchants, the law, other guilds) and the general social
background to thief activities.
<P></P>
Immediately before the section on designing guilds, there is the crucial issue
of the power at the top of the guild. This is usually the Guildmaster?or maybe
a small group of dominant thieves, a ruling council. The personalities
involved here will have a major effect on the personality of the guild, and need
careful design by the DM.
<P></P>
An extensive design section, complete with play-aid record sheets, is then
provided to enable the DM to develop a thieves' guild for the major urban
setting(s) in his campaign. This section uses a flexible approach to guild design. That
is, there are tables which can be used for random determination of aspects of
guilds, and dice-rolling alone will generate workable guild structures.
However, the DM is encouraged to use a guided-semirandom approach, tailoring or
omitting certain dice rolls and choosing design options which produce the most
suitable and pleasing overall picture. This also covers the possibility that there is
no formal thieves' guild, with design options for very loose affiliations or
even relative anarchy!
<P></P>
An example, the thieves' guild of Mallain, shows how to use the design system.
This example takes an apparently contradictory set of dice rolls, and shows
how to resolve them; the result is that the intrigues and tensions in the
resulting Guild structure can be a focus for adventures for any PCs. The Guild becomes
far more than just an anonymous body a thief PC pays dues to!
<P></P>
A short section on unusual thieves' guilds (travellers on the road and others
such) is followed by a valuable DM resource, a section on handling PC
Guildmasters. The straightforward system laid out here handles guild income, hassles,
arrests, trials and tribulations, followers arriving and leaving, morale, and the
day-to-day business of running a thieves' guild. This should make life a lot
easier for the DM!
<P></P>
A small number of selected &quot;blueprint profiles&quot; for major NPCs within a guild
follow; the DM can use these unchanged in game play or modify them as he wishes.
