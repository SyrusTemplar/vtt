<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Inherent Immunity/Cold:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This character is able to remain comfortable in temperatures that most find
chilling, and he can sometimes avoid the worst effects of cold-based attacks
such as white dragon breath. In game terms, the character gains a +2 bonus to
saving throws against cold attacks (but only physical cold; not, for example,
against the chilling touch of a wight).
<P></P>
Additionally, the character can reduce his level of encumbrance caused by
winter garments. In those cases where the DM might require some penalty for a party
that must bundle up in furs, parkas, mittens, and boots, the character with
this trait can dress one level of encumbrance lighter and still avoid the effects
of the weather.
