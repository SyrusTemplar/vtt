When <I>chaotic combat</I> is cast on a fighter, he is inspired beyond his years of training and is
suddenly struck with numerous insights for variations on the standard moves of
attack and defense. The spell affects only warriors.
<P></P>
Unfortunately, these insights are helpful in only two-thirds of the warrior's
attacks. In the remaining attacks, the spell actually impairs the warrior's
standard performance. At the beginning of each round, after the player has
declared his character's actions, 1d6 is rolled for the affected warrior. On a roll of
1, 2, 3, or 4, the warrior gains bonuses of +2 to attack rolls and +2 to armor
class. On a roll of 5 or 6, the warrior suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls
and a -2 penalty to armor class. This must be determined at the beginning of the
round so that both the warrior and his opponents can apply the necessary
changes.
<P></P>
The insight imparted by this spell is lost after the spell expires. The
insight is generated by chaos, which is nearly impossible to contain. After the spell
expires, the warrior remembers the battle but not the specifics of his
actions. He is unable to duplicate the maneuvers.
