Mordenkainen's celerity</I> affects spells of levels 1-3 which alter the movement of the wizard such as <I>feather fall, jump, spider climb, levitate, fly</I>, and <I>haste</I>. Spells to be affected must be cast within 1 turn of the casting of the
celerity. Spells do not expire when the celerity expires.
<P></P>
Spells cast following the celerity receive a 25% bonus to duration. This
effect may not be gained in conjunction with other means of magically extending a
spell's duration. In addition, the caster's movement rate is increased by 25%. <I>Feather fall</I> is an exception; the rate of descent may be reduced by 25% at the caster's
option.
<P></P>
The area of effect is always the caster, except in the case of the <I>haste</I> spell, for which the effects of the celerity will operate on 1d4 creatures in
addition to the wizard. The celerity will not affect the other creatures in
any other manner.
<P></P>
The celerity gives the wizard a +2 bonus to his saving throws against spells
of levels 1-3 which directly affect his movement. This includes <I>web, hold person</I>, and <I>slow</I>. The wizard also gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against magical
paralysis attacks.
<P></P>
The material component is a small pouch or vessel containing centipede or
millipede legs.
