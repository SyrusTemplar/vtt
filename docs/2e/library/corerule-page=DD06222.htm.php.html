Magic is common in most AD&amp;D® campaign worlds, so opponents are not
necessarily suspicious of extraordinary effects that appear to defy natural laws.
However, in certain instances, illusions that incorporate magical effects or special
attacks will require saving throw modifiers. In general, a wizard cannot create
excessively bizarre magical effects in his illusion without arousing the
suspicion of the subject, adding a saving throw modifier of as much as +2.

Example:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> An illusion of a pile of sticks that abruptly bursts into flames. Saving throw
modifier: 0. This is not an unusual magical effect.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> An illusion of a pile of sticks that bursts into green flames; the flames then
change into a miniature replica of a purple castle with frog's legs; the
castle tap dances, and finally turns into a pumpkin with the subject's face before
disappearing in a puff of pink smoke, and the sticks are unburned. Saving throw
modifier: +2. This is downright bizarre, easily justifying the higher modifier.
