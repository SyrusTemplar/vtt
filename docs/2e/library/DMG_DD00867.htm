As the name implies, this category is a catch-all for many sorts of magical
items. Some are powerful, others weak; some are highly desirable, others are
deadly to the finder. The number of miscellaneous items is great enough that
duplication of items in a campaign can kept to a minimum.
<P></P>
Reveal information about items with care. Initially, describe an item only in
the most general of terms: wood, metal, cloth, leather, etc. Allow players to
ask questions about the look, feel, and smell of an item. Likewise, do not
simply blurt out the properties and powers of an item. Items must be held, or worn,
or manipulated before revealing their secrets. Bards, sages, <I>identify</I> spells, and so on may be the best (and easiest) determiners of magical
qualities, but experimentation and experience are useful and make for good
role-playing.
<P></P>
Items are listed alphabetically. Unless a description specifically restricts
item use, or a letter representing a particular class follows a listing, items
are usable by any class. Class letters are (C) clerics, (F) fighters, etc., and
each listing includes appropriate sub-classes.
