This power allows the user to shift his body into a different frequency of
motion, making him transparent to the unphased world around him. While this power
is in effect, the user can walk through solid matter. No physical force or
energy can harm him, though other phased objects or creatures can do so.
<P></P>
A phased character can move vertically at 10 feet each round; over solid
ground at his normal movement rate; over water or silt at half normal; and through
solid matter at one-fourth the normal rate. If a character fails to pay the cost
while moving through solid matter, he suffers 3d10 points of damage, falls
into a coma for 1d6 hours, and phases immediately into the Ethereal Plane. Note
that a phased character isn’t affected by gravity. If a hero is falling off a
cliff and activates this power, he retains any momentum he had and phases into the
ground 21_2 feet for every 10 feet he falls. He must then have enough PSPs to
reverse his fall and phase out of the ground or suffer the consequences noted
above.
<P></P>
A phased character receives a +2 bonus to his MAC during psionic combat and
gets a +2 bonus to all saving throws vs. mind-affecting magic or effects.
Conversely, his MTHAC0 receives a –2 penalty.
