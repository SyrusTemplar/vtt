This spell allows a wizard to control natural fires by manipulating randomness
and adjusting probabilities to cause them to spread and take shape in any
direction he desires. Once cast, the wizard points at any fire within range. He can
then cause that fire to move in any direction desired within spell range, as
long as the flames contact a solid surface (the fire may not be raised in the
air).
<P></P>
The caster must maintain concentration or the spell fails. The flames can be
spread at the rate of 50 square feet per turn. Thus, if a caster affects a
campfire, he could create a flaming line 1 foot wide and 50 feet long or fill a 5' 0
10' square in a single round.
<P></P>
The flames are not limited by a lack of burnable material and can be directed
to spread over water, snow, ice, and other nonflammable surfaces. The surface
is not harmed, but objects and creatures caught in the flames suffer damage as
if they had stepped into the original fire source. Thus, a character caught in
flames created from a candle will suffer only minor damage, while a character
caught in a blaze that originated from a huge bonfire will be severely burned.
<P></P>
The material components are a small paintbrush and a pot of pitch.
