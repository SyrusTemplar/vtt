</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Many of the attack options described below use a game mechanic known as an
opposed roll. In an opposed roll, whoever comes closest to their success number
without going past it wins the contest.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>For example, two characters wrestling for control of one sword could be
required to make opposed Strength checks to see who gets the weapon. The character
with the highest d20 roll that doesn’t exceed his Strength score wins the contest.
<P></P>
</I>
<P></P>
Because the goal of an opposed roll is to come as close to missing as possible
without doing it, attack rolls are won by the character with the lowest roll
that doesn’t go under their required to-hit number, and ability checks are won
by the character with the highest roll that doesn’t exceed his ability score.
Ties extend the contest one round, unless stated otherwise.
