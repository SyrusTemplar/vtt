</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Assuming that the basic battlefield is a flat, barren plain, obstacles are
anything that interrupt a characterâ€™s movement or provide cover against missile
fire. They include streams, ponds, bogs, trees, thickets, dunes or drifts, slopes
or bluffs, boulders, buildings, or walls.
<P></P>
As noted above, obstacles have two basic effects: limiting movement and
providing cover. For example, most characters have to go around a tree trunk and can
stand behind it to use it for cover. If an obstacle just limits movement
instead of blocking it completely, it can usually be crossed or climbed at the cost
of a half-move for the character.
