Weapon expertise is a form of specialization that is available to nonfighters.
Regular weapon specialization (described below) is only available to
single-classed fighters, but weapon expertise can be learned by paladins, rangers, and
multi-classed fighters. There’s no reason a single-classed fighter <I>couldn’t</I> learn expertise instead of specialization, but expertise is just as expensive
as specialization and isn’t as good.
<P></P>
Weapon expertise allows a character to gain extra attacks as if he or she were
a weapon specialist. At 1st level, an expert with the long sword gets to
attack three times per two rounds. Weapon expertise also allows the use of any
unusual weapon properties reserved for specialist use. Weapon expertise does not
grant the character extra attack or damage bonuses, as weapon specialization does.

could not attain. Under these rules, paladins, rangers, and multi-classed
fighters can specialize at the cost of sacrificing other abilities or advantages.
Similarly, priests and rogues may be able to gain weapon expertise. If you aren’t
using the <I>Skills &amp; Powers</I> book, we recommend that you limit specialization and mastery to single-class
fighters only, and limit expertise to paladins, rangers, and multi-class
fighters.
