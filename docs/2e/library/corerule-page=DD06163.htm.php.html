To earn a living as a lecturer, a wizard must have the engaging personality of
an entertainter as well as the knowledge of a scholar. Such a wizard may
travel from city to city, giving lectures in his field of expertise at the
invitation of academies, royal courts, and private organizations. Lecturers with
reputations as compelling speakers sometimes rent halls and charge admission.
