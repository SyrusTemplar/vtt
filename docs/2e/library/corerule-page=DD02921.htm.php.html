ogres, bugbears, and more questionable heritages. No two look alike, but all
appear to be poorly constructed combinations of various humanoid races, with
misshapen limbs of different shapes and proportions. Without exception, mongrelmen
are hideously ugly, and most are ashamed of their appearance and go to great
lengths to conceal their bodies from others.

Mongrelmen are often enslaved by evil societies, and ostracized even by good
ones. Without a place in the world, they have developed great patience and a
surprising degree of human kindness and compassion within their misshapen forms.
They tend to avoid bloodshed when they can, staying in the shadows and living by
petty theft and scavenging.
