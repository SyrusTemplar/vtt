the seas and oceans of the campaign world by observing celestial clues.
Characters with a sextant (not necessarily available in all campaigns) and a compass,
and who can see the stars or observe a sunrise or sunset, will know where they
are—no proficiency check is necessary. Such a skilled character can navigate
across entire oceans without becoming lost, though bad weather can obscure the
celestial clues and blow a vessel far off course.
<P></P>
If a character does not have the proper tools, or is forced to work with only
a general idea of direction (fog obscures the sunset, for example), the DM
should secretly make the proficiency check. Success means the character is
reasonably accurate in plotting the day’s course. Failure means an off-course error
that varies by the extent of the failure—a roll of 20 has the character going
practically the exact opposite direction!
