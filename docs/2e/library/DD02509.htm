<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">For our purposes, a duel is any fight that takes place between a PC and one
humanoid enemy armed with a weapon of some kind. It doesn-t begin, though, until
the two combatants have actually engaged in melee. Don-t begin using these
rules, including the special initiative system below, until this happens.
<P></P>
Generally, it's not worth the extra time and effort to use the dueling rules
unless the enemy is close to the PC's own skill level; if the hero can clean the
villain's clock within a round or two, don-t bother to use these rules.
<P></P>
Duels are best saved for confrontations with major NPC villains. If more than
one character or creature is engaged on either side, the fight doesn-t count as
a duel anymore; the subtleties of attack and defense are quickly lost when
several combatants become involved. The DM has the authority to declare that a
duel has turned into a normal melee whenever he sees fit.
