<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cloak of Displacement:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This item appears to be a normal cloak, but when it is worn by a character its
magical properties distort and warp light waves. This displacement of light
wave causes the wearer to appear to be 1 foot to 2 feet from his actual position.
Any missile or melee attack aimed at the wearer automatically misses the first
time. This can apply to first attacks from multiple opponents only if the
second and successive attackers were unable to observe the initial displacement
miss.
<P></P>
After the first attack, the cloak affords a +2 bonus to protection (i.e., two
classes better on Armor Class), as well as a +2 bonus to saving throws versus
attacks directed at the wearer (such as spells, gaze weapon attacks, spitting
and breath attacks, etc., which are aimed at the wearer of the <I>cloak of displacement</I>).
<P></P>
Note that 75% of all <I>cloaks of displacement</I> are sized for humans or elves (persons 5 to 6 feet tall), and 25% are sized
for persons of about 4 feet in height (dwarves, gnomes, halflings).
