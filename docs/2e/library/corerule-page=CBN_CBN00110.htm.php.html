Range: Touch
<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>
Duration: Permanent
<P></P>
Casting Time: 2 rounds
<P></P>
Area of Effect: Two creatures
<P></P>
Saving Throw: Neg.
<P></P>

This spell is similar to the 4th-level wizard spell <I>empathic wound transfer</I>, except that it enables the caster to transfer the wounds (up to 3 hp per
level of the caster) between any two creatures, excluding the caster. The wizard
must be able to grasp both the creature with the disability and the creature
about to receive the disability without having to make attack rolls. Thus, the two
beings must either be willing to undergo the spell, or else be sleeping,
unconscious, or otherwise bound and secured from escaping the caster’s grasp.
<P></P>
The recipient of the disability is entitled to a saving throw vs. spells if
unwilling. If the recipient’s saving throw succeeds, the transfer is incomplete
and nothing further happens. If failed, the recipient gains the wounds of the
disabled creature, subject to a few limitations.
<P></P>
The total amount of transferred hit points is limited to the caster’s current
hit points (or 3 hp per level, whichever is<I> smaller</I>). Normally, the spell functions by conveying the wounds from the disabled
creature to the caster (during the first round of casting) and then from the
caster to the final recipient (during the second round of the spell). Should an
conferred disability drain the wizard below zero hit points (if the wizard
unwittingly attempts to channel more hit points than he or she currently possesses),
the exchange effectively backfires and now operates on the wizard himself as an <I>empathic wound transfer</I>. The spell also backfires if it is interrupted during the second round of
casting, before the final conferral of life force to the recipient.
<P></P>
At the DM’s discretion, this spell will never backfire when employed by a
necromancer, who is presumably an expert in these rites. If interrupted during
casting, the spell merely fails without any transfer of wounds from the disabled
creature. When cast by a necromancer, this spell can also immediately restore an
incapacitated and unconscious creature, as per the 3rd-level priest spell <I>death’s door</I>.
<P></P>
This spell is terribly exhausting for the caster. After the exchange is
complete, the wizard temporarily loses seven points of Constitution; each point may
be recovered by two hours of complete rest. If the caster’s Constitution drops
below 3, unconsciousness results, and the full Constitution is not regained for
24 hours. The material components are the same as for as the<I> empathic wound transfer</I> spell, except for a specially fashioned ruby brooch or pendant (worth at
least 5,000 gp) which must be worn by the wizard at the time of casting. The ruby,
which serves as a temporary receptacle or buffer for the exchanged life force,
shatters upon the completion of the spell.
