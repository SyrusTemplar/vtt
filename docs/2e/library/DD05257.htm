<P></P>
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The same Specializing rules apply to Martial Arts: Once the character has
Proficiency in Martial Arts (by spending one Weapon Proficiency slot), he can
Specialize in it (by spending another).
<P></P>
When the character becomes a Martial Arts Specialist, he gains the following
benefits:
<P></P>
He gains a +1 bonus to all his attack rolls with Martial Arts;
<P></P>
He gains a +1 bonus to all damage with Martial Arts;
<P></P>
He gains a +1 chart bonus with all Martial Arts attacks;
<P></P>
He gains one additional Martial Arts attack per combat round (both hands must
be free, holding nothing, for the character to gain this benefit); and
<P></P>
He may pull his attack just as Punching and Wrestling characters do, and when
he pulls his attack, he can also refuse to do the +1 damage that Specialization
gives him.
<P></P>
<P></P>
So if he rolls a 15 to attack, and the attack hits, he has performed a Side
Kick. If he uses his +1 chart bonus, he can change that into an Elbow Shot or a
Head Bash. He'll probably choose to change it to a Head Bash for the improved
damage and improved chance of knockout.
<P></P>
It is possible for a Warrior to continue to improve his Martial Arts
abilities: See &quot;Continuing Specialization,&quot; below.
