</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Some heroes specialize in fighting with ranged weapons; Robin Hood and William
Tell spring to mind as good examples. Characters who choose to specialize in
missile or thrown weapon style gain two benefits. First, they can move up to
half their normal movement rate and still attack with their full rate of fire, or
make a full move and attack at half their rate of fire. Second, they gain a
bonus of ?1 to their AC against enemy missile fire while attacking with a ranged
weapon.
