<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Description:</B> The Pathfinder has an
uncanny knack for blazing trails, a skill that allows him to find the
easiest routes, reduce travel time, and avoid natural hazards. His
acute sense of direction minimizes his chance of getting lost. He can
estimate the number of miles he's covered with startling accuracy.
The Pathfinder makes an invaluable guide, helping to ensure safe and
efficient passage.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Though Pathfinders come from all walks of
life, most have homelands in sparsely settled or exceptionally
hostile terrains where learning to find one's way can mean the
difference between life and death. A Pathfinder usually demonstrates
an aptitude for trailblazing early in life, but diligent practice is
required to refine his skills. Often, a young Pathfinder exercises
his skill by asking a companion to blindfold him, lead him into an
unexplored area in the wilderness, then abandon him. The Pathfinder
must find his way home using only his wits. Experienced Pathfinders
occasionally engage in this game to brush up on their technique or to
impress potential clients.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Requirements:</B> Same as standard ranger.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Primary Terrain:</B> Forest, Hill,
Jungle, Mountain, or Plains.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Role:</B> Though some Pathfinders are
retainers of kings or lords, most operate independently. Pathfinders
are generally regarded as honest, although their services are rarely inexpensive.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Being characters of high principle,
Pathfinders often offer their services to parties undertaking
adventures to promote the common good. Rarely will a Pathfinder join
a party purely for gain, though he may consider such an arrangement
when business is slow.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; As a member of an adventuring party, the
Pathfinder usually finds himself in front, scouting the terrain ahead
to ascertain the best route and spot potential hazards. Unless the
Pathfinder has organized the party himself, he usually leaves the
leadership role to someone else while he concentrates on trailblazing.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Secondary Skills: </B>Farmer,
Forester, Groom, Hunter, Navigator, Trapper/Furrier.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Weapon Proficiencies:</B> A Pathfinder
must fill an initial weapon slot with the machete (see Chapter 7),
hand axe, or sword; such weapons are useful for cutting away brush
and clearing paths. Subsequent slots may be filled with any weapons
of his choice (see also Special Benefits).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonus:</I>
Direction Sense, Distance Sense*, Trail Marking*. Required:
Alertness*. <I>Recommended:</I> Camouflage*, Endurance,
Fire-building, Foraging*, Mountaineering, Navigation, Signaling*,
Trail Signs*, Weather Sense.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Because he spends
a lot of time on foot, the Pathfinder favors light armor, such as
leather or padded. He seldom carries a shield. Otherwise, the
Pathfinder has no particular preferences or requirements.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Species Enemy:</B> Any.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Followers: </B>All species are
eligible, though the Pathfinder is likely to attract followers with
higher movement rates (12+), as he tends to have little patience with
creatures that can't keep up with him.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Special Benefits:</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The first two benefits, <I>trail sense</I>
and <I>overland guiding</I>, apply only when the Pathfinder leads the
party. At least 20 feet must separate the Pathfinder from the rest of
the party; the proximity of others distracts the Pathfinder, making
him unable to take advantage of these benefits.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Trail Sense:</I> The Pathfinder's
chance of getting lost in any outdoor land setting is reduced by 10%.
Furthermore, his base chance of getting lost in his primary terrain
(i.e. the Surroundings column of Table 81 in the <I>DUNGEON MASTER Guide</I>)
will not exceed 20%. This is not cumulative with other benefits,
such as the one for the direction sense proficiency.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Overland Guiding:</I> A Pathfinder is
able to find the optimum trail through rough terrain, increasing the
party's movement rate when traversing long distances. To determine
terrain costs for overland movement when a Pathfinder leads the
party, use Table 49 in this book in place of Table 74 in Chapter 14
of <I>the DUNGEON MASTER Guide</I>. The movement costs indicate
points of movement spent per mile of travel; when moving through the
various terrain types, subtract the points from the total movement
available to the party for that day. (Note that less rugged terrain
types are relatively unaffected, as the optimum paths are usually
obvious, even without the help of a Pathfinder.)</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Marksmanship:</I> Owing to his steady
hand and acute vision, the Pathfinder has a +1 bonus to the attacks
made with a favorite missile weapon. It must be one in which he has
proficiency and selected as a weapon of choice.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Recognize Trail Hazard.</I> By
observing subtle changes in the terrain, the Pathfinder is able to
recognize natural hazards, enabling him and his companions to avoid
them. Typical hazards include quicksand, sinkholes, slippery slopes,
and thin ice. A Pathfinder has no special ability to recognize
man-made hazards, such as pit traps or dangerous bridges, nor does he
have any special talent for anticipating encounters with hostile
natives or animals.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A Pathfinder's chance of recognizing a
hazard is 10% per experience level; to a maximum chance of 90% at
ninth level. If the DM determines that the Pathfinder is approaching
an area containing a natural hazard, he secretly rolls percentile
dice. If the roll is equal to or less than the Pathfinder's chance,
the Pathfinder recognizes a potential hazard. (Optionally, the DM
might only describe an unusual aspect of the terrain and let the
Pathfinder come to his own conclusions. For example, if the
Pathfinder is approaching a pool of quicksand, the DM might say that
the ground feels exceptionally spongy. If the Pathfinder nears a
patch of thin ice, the DM might point out that the ice ahead is
discolored and laced with tiny cracks).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;<B> Special Hindrances:</B> By moving
ahead of the party, the Pathfinder places himself in a position of
risk. Separated from his companions, the Pathfinder is more likely to
be the victim of enemy attacks. He runs a greater risk of drawing
fire from snipers, and is more susceptible to ambushes from hostile
creatures. If he fails to recognize a hazard, he'll probably be the
first to become a victim.</FONT></P>
