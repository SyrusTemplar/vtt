are intended to serve as a generic model for a priest character, DMs and players
in campaigns that feature specific pantheons or mythoi are encouraged to
create specialty priests to reflect the particular aims and powers of the different
deities of the world. The druid is presented as an example of a specialty
priest, representing any power that stands for nature—or even nature itself.
<P></P>
In this chapter, we’ll examine the basic cleric and druid classes in great
detail, concentrating on their magical abilities. A number of spells are
reorganized into different spheres in order to provide the specialty priests with basic
abilities that should be common to all priest characters, while maintaining
unique spells that can only be cast by certain specialists. We’ll also introduce
three new types or subclasses of specialty priest: the crusader, the shaman, and
the monk. Last but not least, we’ll present a point-based design system for
customizing specialty priests.

<P></P>
Hordes of specialty priests have been introduced in various accessories
following the <I>Player’s Handbook</I>. There are specialty priesthoods in <I>Legends and Lore, The Complete Priest’s Handbook, Monster Mythology</I>, and several of the campaign settings. At this point, there are well over one
hundred varieties of priests in print! Unfortunately, some of these specialty
priests are far more powerful than similar specialty priests presented in
different settings. This raises the question of which sources are “generic” enough
to use in any campaign setting, and which should be reserved for specific
campaign worlds.
<P></P>
The first rule of thumb is simple: If a campaign setting features its own
pantheon and specialty priests for those powers, you should give that material
precedence. For example, the deities and priesthoods of the Forgotten Realms,
Birthright, or Dark Sun campaign settings are described in detail in their
respective boxed sets. When a player creates a priest character for one of these
settings, he should refer to the character creation rules specific to those settings.
Of course, a DM who has assembled this information for his own campaign can
certainly require his players to create their priest characters accordingly!
<P></P>
If a world does not feature a fully-developed pantheon or special priesthood
rules for the various powers of the mythoi, then you should consider the
material in <I>Player’s Option: Spells &amp; Magic </I>to take precedence over all earlier material. In other words, the rules here
are intended to replace the specialty priesthoods presented in <I>The Complete Priest’s Handbook, Legends and Lore</I>, and <I>Monster Mythology</I>. Note that the powers and faiths presented in these books remain unchanged; <I>Player’s Option: Spells &amp; Magic </I>just changes the way the specialty priests are put together.
