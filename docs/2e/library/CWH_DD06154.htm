When a player has selected a personality type for his character, he can
individualize him further by making decisions about his appearance, his interests,
his family, and other details about his background. This information does not
need to be recorded on the character sheet, but the player is certainly allowed to
do so. The more a player knows about his character, the more he will seem like
a real person and be more fun to play. Here are just a few of the many details
to consider.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Name:</B> Some wizards prefer exotic names that add to their reputations as men of
mystery. Such a name is sometimes a modification of the wizard's real name, such as
&quot;Brindon&quot; for a wizard whose real name is &quot;Benbrindon Swule. &quot; Alternately, a
wizard might make up a new name for himself; for instance, Benbrindon Swule
might decide to call himself &quot;Antra,&quot; an arcane term meaning &quot;Champion of the
Dawn. &quot; Many wizards also add an adjective to their names to declare their
importance to the world, such as &quot;Brindon the Dark&quot; or &quot;Antra the Magnificent. &quot;
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Age:</B> Think about the wizard's age and how it might influence his outlook and
attitudes. Older wizards tend to be wiser and slower, while younger wizards are more
energetic and impulsive. Wizards frequently have long careers; human wizards
can be active well into their 80s and beyond. However, it is unusual for a
novice wizard to be younger than 20 or so, since magical training can take many
years.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Physical Appearance:</B> What does the wizard look like? How tall is he? How much does he weigh? What
color are his hair and eyes? Does he have any interesting birthmarks? Scars?
How did he get them?
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Mannerisms:</B> Often a wizard has a unique physical quirk, eccentric behavior, or habitual
expression that sets him apart from the crowd. Does the wizard rub his chin when
he's thinking? Does he always sleep on his back? Does he pick his teeth with
his fingernail?
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Beliefs:</B> Is the wizard religious? Is his outlook on life generally positive, or is he
a pessimist by nature? Is he superstitious? Does he have any phobias?
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Birthplace and Nationality:</B> The wizard's birthplace reflects his cultural heritage, which in turn
influences the way he looks at the world. Is he upper class (or the equivalent)?
Middle class? Born in poverty?
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Family:</B> What were the wizard's parents like? Did they encourage him to be a wizard,
or are they ashamed of his avocation? Was the wizard an orphan (and if so, has
he learned why he was abandoned)? Does he have brothers and sisters? Is he still
close to them? If not, what happened?
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Birthright:</B> Does the wizard have a special birthright, such as a family heirloom or a
share of the family holdings? Does he stand to inherit this birthright when he
reaches a certain age or achieves a certain goal?
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Education:</B> Where did the wizard receive his magical training? Did he attend a
prestigious academy? Was he taught by a mentor? Several mentors? Is he on good terms with
them, or are they estranged? If so, what happened?
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Career:</B> Unless the wizard is independently wealthy, depends on the kindness of
strangers, or lives like a hermit, he probably has some way to earn a living. In many
cases, a wizard's school of specialization will suggest a career; for
instance, a diviner could probably earn a good living as a fortune teller. Otherwise,
the character can pick any career or vocation that seems reasonable and doesn't
contradict his upbringing. (See the <A HREF="DD06155.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD06155.htm">following section</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> for suggestions.)
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Clothing:</B> You can tell a lot about a person by the way he dresses. A wizard favoring
dark robes suggests a conservative personality, while a wizard wearing glittering
shirts and multi-colored trousers is probably as flamboyant as his clothing.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Likes and Dislikes:</B> Does the wizard have a favorite food? A favorite drink? Does he like music,
books, or art? What types? What does he do for fun? Is he a sportsman? A
gambler? A collector?
