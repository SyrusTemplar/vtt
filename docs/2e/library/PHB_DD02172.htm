This spell is known as <I>wyvern watch</I> because of the insubstantial haze brought forth by its casting, which vaguely
resembles a wyvern. It is typically used to guard some area against intrusion.
Any creature approaching within 10 feet of the guarded area may be affected by
the ?wyvern.? Any creature entering the guarded area must roll a successful
saving throw vs. spell or stand paralyzed for one round per level of the caster,
until freed by the spellcaster, by a <I>dispel magic</I> spell, or by a <I>remove paralysis</I> spell. A successful saving throw indicates that the subject creature was
missed by the attack of the wyvern-form, and the spell remains in place. As soon as
a subject creature is successfully struck by the wyvern-form, the paralysis
takes effect and the force of the spell dissipates. The spell force likewise
dissipates if no intruder is struck by the wyvern-form for eight hours after the
spell is cast. Any creature approaching the space being guarded by the
wyvern-form may be able to detect its presence before coming close enough to be attacked;
this chance of detection is 90% in bright light, 30% in twilight conditions,
and 0% in darkness.
