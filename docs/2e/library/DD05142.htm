<B>Description:</B> The gladiator is a showman-warrior from a society where public combat
competitions are a popular sport. The gladiator is a professional warrior in this
high-profile arena; for the delight (and bloodlust) of the crowds, for his own
personal wealth and aggrandizement (or, if he is a slave, for the profits of his
owner), he fights organized matches against human, demihuman, and even monstrous
opponents.
<P></P>
There are no special ability-score requirements to be a Gladiator.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> For the Gladiator to appear in a campaign, the DM must establish that at
least one culture has gladiatorial combats, and the Gladiator character must come
from such a culture. (He need not have been born there . . . but he will either
have been a slave there or, if he was a freeman, will feel like a naturalized
citizen there.) A Gladiator player-character can be an active gladiator in the
arena, one who adventures in his free time (or within some other context of the
current adventure), or can have formerly been a gladiator now living the life
of the adventurer.
<P></P>
In the campaign, the Gladiator is going to be a showy, high-profile warrior.
He performs dangerous stunts in combat. He attracts the attention of crowds of
admirers. He receives a lot of credit for brave deeds whether he deserves the
credit or not. A Gladiator can be a callous brute, a dirty arena fighter with no
interests other than killing his enemy as quickly as possible and making off
with his prize; or he can be a clean-limbed, heroic figure, a hero who always
fights honorably in the arena and never kills when he does not have to.
<P></P>
DMs take note: a Gladiator character is not likely to be a Ranger. You can
permit it if you wish, but Rangers are very wilderness-oriented characters, and
Gladiators are very urban. A Ranger could have been captured, enslaved, trained
as a Gladiator, and then escaped?but still, the Ranger and Gladiator
personalities don't seem to work together very well. Allow this only if you really wish to.
<P></P>
It's up to the DM to decide whether there are female gladiators on his world.
Unless his campaign is already rigidly set up to prevent it, he might as well
allow it; a she-gladiator character could be a very interesting one.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> The Gladiator character receives his secondary skill through whatever means
is usual for the campaign?by choice or random die-roll. This skill probably
represents the trade he learned before becoming a Gladiator.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Required: short sword (gladius), trident, net. Gladiators should learn an
even mix of normal and unusual weapons; the DM is within his rights to insist that
the Gladiator learn one strange weapon proficiency (such as whip) for every
&quot;normal&quot; proficiency (like sword, spear, etc.). (Also, see the <I>Equipment</I> chapter, under &quot;New Arms&quot; and &quot;New Armor,&quot; for weapons and armor especially
appropriate to Gladiator characters.)
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Bonus Proficiencies: (Warrior) Charioteering, (Rogue) Tumbling (for the
combat showmanship that characterizes arena fighting). Recommended: (General) Animal
Handling, Animal Training, Etiquette, Riding (Land-Based), (Warrior) Armorer,
Blind-Fighting, Endurance, Gaming, Weapon-smithing, (Priest) Healing (double
slots unless Paladin).
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> The Gladiator may buy any sort of non-magical weapon or combination of
weapons before beginning play. However, he must choose his armor from the listing of
Gladiator Armor in the <I>Equipment</I> chapter, under &quot;New Armors.&quot;
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> Gladiators, because of their intensive training, get a <I>free</I> Weapon Specialization (see under &quot;<A HREF="PHB_DD01530.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01530.htm">Weapon Specialization</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">&quot; in the 2nd Edition<I> Player's Handbook</I>). This doesn't cost any of their beginning weapon proficiencies: They still
get all four of those, <I>and </I>get this Specialization free. It must be chosen from one of the following
weapons: bow (choice), cestus*, dagger, drusus*, lasso*, net*, scimitar, short
sword, spear, trident, and whip. (The &quot;*&quot; indicates a new weapon found in the <I>Equipment</I> chapter.)
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> Gladiators tend to be recognized?as Gladiators, at least, if not by their own
names?wherever they go. This makes it more difficult for them to do things in
secret; some troublesome NPC is always remembering &quot;the tall, fair-haired
gladiator&quot; who was at the scene of the action, which makes it very easy for the
authorities to follow the heroes' trail. (This is something the DM will have to
enforce scrupulously if the Gladiator is to have hindrances offsetting his
benefits.)
<P></P>
Also, and this is strictly a role-playing consideration, promoters and
managers are always interfering in the Gladiator's life: Trying to hire him to
participate in certain-death events, to fight people the Gladiator doesn't want to
fight, to force him to participate in events taking place at the exact time the
Gladiator needs to be somewhere else, etc. These promoters will go to any length
to get their way; they may blackmail the character, kidnap his followers, use
the time-honored bait of a gorgeous romantic interest (whom the Gladiator
doesn't immediately realize is an employee of the promoter), and so forth.
<P></P>
To make sure this is regarded as a hindrance, the DM should make it clear that
these promoters are mostly of the sleazy variety who will cheat, rob and
betray him at the drop of a hat.
<P></P>
<B>Wealth Options:</B> The Gladiator gets the standard 5d4x10 gp to spend, and may spend it any way
he chooses (subject to the restrictions listed in &quot;Equipment,&quot; immediately
above) or have it all unspent at the beginning of play.
<P></P>
<B>Races: </B><I>Any</I> demihuman warrior can be a Gladiator. Operators of the arenas try to acquire
as many different, unusual fighters as they can, by hiring or enslaving them,
and demihumans (when they can be acquired) are major attractions.
