?? <B>Description:</B> Like the Errant, the Expatriate has no permanent home, wandering from place
to place in search of adventure and acceptance. However, the Expatriate is a
nomad by circumstance, not choice. A warrior in exile, the Expatriate has
renounced his allegiance to the officials or institution that originally granted him
his paladinhood. His government or church may have become corrupt, his superiors
may have betrayed their commitment to lawful good principles, or he have may
have been dismissed for political reasons. In any case, his disillusionment is
complete. He now makes his own decisions.
<P></P>
?? There are two points in his career when a paladin may become an Expatriate:
<P></P>
?? 1. He may become an Expatriate at 1st level, taking this kit just as he would
any other. Presumably, the character was unaware of the corrupt nature of his
government or church while being trained, discovering the truth shortly after
taking his Oath of Ennoblement. Alternately, a political coup may have occurred
early in the character's career, replacing a lawful good regime with an evil one.
<P></P>
?? 2. A character with another paladin kit may abandon it when his superiors
betray him or some other dramatic event occurs that prompts him to renounce his
fealty. The character may either become a standard paladin (described in the
&quot;Abandoning Kits&quot; section later in this chapter) or?with the DM's approval?he may
become an Expatriate, retaining his current level (a 3rd-level Errant who
renounces his fealty becomes a 3rd-level Expatriate). The new Expatriate keeps all of
his equipment and proficiencies, but drops the Special Benefits and Hindrances
associated with his previous kit; he acquires the Special Benefits and
Hindrances of the Expatriate kit instead.
<P></P>
?? <B>Requirements: </B>Standard.
<P></P>
<B>?? Ministration:</B> Independent.
<P></P>
<B>?? Role:</B> Though still lawful good, an Expatriate distrusts most formal institutions,
including lawful good governments and organized religions. He obeys the dictates
of his conscience and his deity only, remaining skeptical of all
self-proclaimed and elected authorities. Though courteous and respectful, he no longer
automatically follows the orders those holding positions of power. He weighs each
request against his own principles, agreeing to a mission or favor only if
completely convinced of its merit.
<P></P>
?? Expatriates are often moody, cynical, and bitter. An Expatriate may feel his
good name has been permanently tarnished, a condition he struggles to correct by
volunteering for demanding, even dangerous, missions. He remains loyal to his
lawful good comrades but resists close friendships. He has little patience with
most neutral characters, finding their lack of commitment insipid and
contemptible. He crushes his enemies without remorse.
<P></P>
?? Few governments or churches trust Expatriates enough to hire them as
mercenaries. Therefore, Expatriates must rely on treasure or tournament winnings to make
a living.
<P></P>
<B>?? Symbol:</B> If an Expatriate carries a symbol of his former government or church, he
defaces it with slashes or scratches to proclaim his independence.
<P></P>
<B>?? Secondary Skills:</B> Armorer, Farmer, Fisher, Forester, Groom, Hunter, Leather Worker, Miner,
Scribe, Trapper/Furrier, Weaponsmith, Woodworker/Carver.
<P></P>
<B>?? Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Any.
<P></P>
<B>?? Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Any.
<P></P>
?? <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Standard.
<P></P>
<B>?? Bonded Mount:</B> Any.
<P></P>
<B>?? Special Benefits:</B>
<P></P>
<I>?? Self-Reliance:</I> An Expatriate comes and goes as he pleases, subservient to no one. He has no
edicts to follow, other than those imposed by his deity or his own principles.
<P></P>
<I>?? Reaction Bonus:</I> An Expatriate remains a hero to the peasants and other oppressed people of
his homeland, who admire him for his integrity and sterling character; from all
those not associated with the officials of his former government or church, he
receives a +2 modifier to his reaction rolls. To commoners of other lands
familiar with his reputation, he also receives a +2 reaction modifier. Additionally,
he will be given food and shelter from all commoners whose modified reaction is
Friendly. This courtesy extends to any companions, so long as he vouches for
them.
<P></P>
<B>?? Special Hindrances:</B>
<P></P>
<I>?? Self-Reliance:</I> Independence also has its drawbacks. As with the Errant, the Expatriate has
no government or church to provide loans, supplies, or support. He may build a
stronghold if he saves enough money, but he isn't eligible for property grants,
charters, or benefices.
<P></P>
<I>?? Reaction Penalty:</I> Elite NPCs are reluctant to associate too closely with an Expatriate, fearing
they might invite the wrath of the Expatriate's former government or church.
Therefore, sensing the Expatriate's discomfort and distrust, all characters in
positions of power suffer a ?2 modifier to their reaction rolls.
<P></P>
<I>?? Fugitive Status:</I> Officials of the Expatriate's original government or church consider him an
embarrassment at best, a traitor at worst. An Expatriate is constantly hunted
and harassed by his ex-employers, who may seek to punish, arrest, or even execute
him.
