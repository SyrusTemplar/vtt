Certain powerful magical items, particularly intelligent ones, have
alignments. Alignment in these cases is not an indication of the moral properties of the
item. Rather, it is a means of limiting the number and types of characters
capable of using the item--the user's alignment must match the item's alignment for
the magic to work properly. Aligned magical items, usually weapons, were
created with a specific ethos in mind. the item was attuned to this ethos by its
creator.
<P></P>
Aligned items reveal their true powers only to owners who share the same
beliefs. In the hands of anyone else, the item's powers remain dormant. An extremely
powerful item may even harm a character of another alignment who handles the
item, especially if the character's alignment is opposed to the item's.
<P></P>
Aligned magical items should be rare. When an item has an alignment, it is a
sign of great power and purpose. This creates opportunities for highly dramatic
adventures as the player characters learn about the item, research its history,
track it across the country, and finally discover its ancient resting place
and overcome the guards and traps set to protect it.
