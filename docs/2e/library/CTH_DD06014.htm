<B>Amulet of Dramatic Death:</B> Only a few of these prized items exist, each created for a high-level thief
in the service of two powerful spellcasters, a mage and an illusionist, who
combined their skills to create them. There are six amulets known, which differ in
only one respect; all have the following common properties.
<P></P>
The amulet is activated when the wearer suffers one particular attack form
(and only that attack form) which would be sufficient to kill or wholly disable
the wearer (e.g., by <I>petrification</I>). At this point the magic of the amulet is activated. Damage sustained from
the killing attack is wholly negated, and a special attack (such as <I>petrification</I>) likewise negated. The thief is at once made invisible. Lastly, a powerful
programmed illusion is brought into operation so that the amulet-wearer appears
to have been slain or disabled by the attack. This programmed illusion is both
complete and dramatic—e.g., an amulet protecting against magical fire will show
the victim of <I>fireball</I> attack as a burned corpse, complete with the smell of roasted flesh. Only
direct, tactile checks or a powerful <I>divination</I> spell will reveal the illusion for what it is. The amulet will function only
once per day. Roll 1d6 on the table below to determine the single attack form
which is protected against by the amulet.

<B>Boots of Balance:</B> The wearer of these soft, low-heeled supple leather boots is endowed with a
magically enhanced sense of balance. This has the following important effects:
<P></P>
(i) A thief wearing the boots gains a +10% bonus to all move silently rolls
and also to all climb walls rolls.
<P></P>
(ii) The Dexterity of any character wearing the boots is increased by one
point for all purposes where the hands are not involved. Thus, a thief cannot claim
a bonus to skills such as open locks, but a bonus to Armor Class may apply,
and likewise a bonus applies to Dexterity checks in certain situations (e.g., to
avoid a fall).
<P></P>
(iii) The wearer gains the tightrope walking proficiency; if this is already
possessed, a -4 bonus modifier applies to all proficiency check die rolls when
wearing the boots.
<P></P>
A wearer of <I>boots of balance</I> cannot also claim a further bonus for moving silently from mundane aids (such
as the use of leather strapping to cross creaky floorboards). Also, the
bonuses gained from <I>boots of balance</I> cannot be added to the bonus gained if the wearer also uses <I>gauntlets of dexterity</I>.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Gloves of Evasion:</B> These gloves are made of exceptionally supple, thin calfskin, and when put on
they blend with the skin and become virtually undetectable (and are detection
resistant). A thief wearing them gains a +10% bonus to open locks skill and can
undo almost any knot automatically in one round. Any character wearing the
gloves gains a proficiency in escapology, being able to manipulate his hands in
such a way that he can escape from manacles, chains, irons or similar restraints
if a Dexterity check (with a +2 bonus if the character is a thief) is made.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B> Mantle of the Mundane:</B> This very ordinary, even shabby, brown or grey cloak makes its wearer appear
utterly unmemorable. It gives a 5% bonus to hide in shadows in all
circumstances and makes the wearer 80% undetectable if in a crowd (detection resistance
applies here also). It also makes the wearer almost impossible to recognize after
having been seen—very useful in avoiding identification after a crime. Unless a
witness (and it must be an eye witness) makes a check against one-fourth of
his Intelligence the wearer of the mantle will have appeared so mundane and
boring in appearance that the witness will be unable to relate him to the thief
(regardless of whether the thief is wearing the mantle the next time the witness
sees him).
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Robe of Vanishing:</B> This simple and innocent-looking robe is a boon for a thief needing to elude
pursuers quickly. The thief only needs to grasp the hems of the robe and clutch
it very tightly about him and he will simply seem to vanish, although the
thief will just have been affected as per a <I>rope trick</I> spell (no rope is visible, of course) and also made invisible. detection
resistance applies to the extradimensional space created. The <I>rope trick</I> effect will last for up to six turns but the invisibility created is of the
normal sort (permanent until some offensive action is undertaken). Wise thieves
will make sure that other magical aids to escape (notably a <I>potion of flying</I>) are on hand to maximize the value of this robe. The robe can be used up to
three times per day to create its magical effects.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Shadowcloak:</B> This large, cowled cloak is made from pure black velvet. When worn by a thief
it improves hide in shadows chances by 25% and makes a thief 50% likely to be
invisible in near-darkness (even to infravision, ultravision, etc.). It can
also be used to cast <I>darkness, darkness 15' radius</I>, and <I>continual darkness</I> once each per day (at 12th level of magic use). Finally, once per day the
wearer can actually transform into a shadow (cf.<I> Monstrous Compendium I</I>) for up to 12 turns, becoming a shadow in all respects save for mental ones
(thus, the wearer cannot be damaged by nonmagical weapons, undead take the
wearer for a shadow and ignore him, etc.). Saves against light-based attacks (e.g.,
a <I>light</I> spell cast into the eyes) are always made at -2 by the wearer of a <I>shadowcloak.
<P></P>
</I> If a cleric successfully makes a turning attempt against the wearer in
shadowform, the cloak wearer is permitted a saving throw (this is at -4 if the cleric
is actually able to damn/destroy shadows). If the save fails, the wearer
suffers 1d6 points of damage per level of the cleric and the <I>shadowcloak</I> is destroyed. If the save is made, the character takes half damage and must
flee in fear from the cleric at maximum rate for one turn.
