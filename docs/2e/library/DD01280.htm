days have passed. Until that time, any healing the character receives revives
the character as long as the healing is sufficient to give the character a
positive hit point total.
<P></P>
The wearer can be raised or resurrected no matter how the character died. The <I>raise dead</I> or <I>resurrection</I> spells can be cast upon the amulet if the character-s body has been destroyed.

* This is the amount of time a single creature in a sealed bag remains
comfortable. After the listed time, the air becomes foul and the creature begins
gasping; a ?2 penalty applies to all attack rolls and ability checks until the
creature gets fresh air. If the creature remains in the bag for twice the listed
time, it must save vs. poison or fall unconscious until the creature gets fresh
air. The save must be repeated each turn. Unconscious creatures also must save
vs. poison every turn, and they die if they fail a second time.
<P></P>
** This shows the amount of water the bag can hold. Note that water is heavy
and a bag carrying the listed amount of water only appears to be about 10% full
as far as its cubic capacity is concerned. This makes it very easy to exceed
the bag-s weight limit and destroy it.

</I></B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Books/Tomes: </I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The baneful effects from all books, tomes, manuals, and librams are triggered
by perusing even a small passage. Magical books cannot be distinguished from
other types of normal or magical books.
<P></P>
A character who studies a book to find out what-s in it triggers the book-s
effects. Magical books always vanish once they bestow a beneficial effect but
usually remain behind if they inflict a harmful effect. Multi-classed characters
get only the best possible result-other helpful results (and harmful ones) are
ignored. For example, an elf fighter/mage/thief glances at a <I>manual of puissant skill at arms</I>, a book that is normally harmful to wizards. Because the elf is a fighter, he
can ignore the harmful effect and gain one fighter level instead.

<P></P>
</I></B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Cloak of Displacement:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The cloak-s displacement power is ineffective against creatures or devices
that cannot see the cloak-s wearer. For example, an invisible character does not
receive the cloak-s power to make opponents miss their initial attack or the
cloak-s armor class bonus; likewise, most traps never -see? their targets and
displacement does not foil them.
<P></P>
Displacement is not effective against attacks that are not aimed, such as an
avalanche or cave-in, and does not affect aimed attacks that cover an area, such
as catapult shots or dragon tail slaps.
<P></P>
Displacement is only partially effective against spell attacks. If a spell
actually requires an attack roll, such as any touch-delivered spell, the cloak
works normally and can cause the spell attack to miss if it is the first attack in
an encounter. If the attacking spell does not require an attack roll, it can
never be caused to -miss,? though the cloak-s +2 saving throw bonus applies.
<P></P>
For example a <I>fireball</I> spell never misses, but the cloak wearer gains a +2 saving throw bonus. If a
spell allows no saving throw, displacement has no effect on it; for example, a <I>magic missile</I> or <I>death spell</I> is never affected by displacement.
<P></P>
Under normal conditions, the first melee or missile attack against a displaced
creature automatically misses. The opponent is assumed to note the displaced
creature-s correct position and can keep track of it thereafter. If an opponent
has multiple attacks, only the first one automatically misses. If there are
multiple opponents, only the first attack by the first creature automatically
misses. The remaining opponents are assumed to observe the failed attack and make
the appropriate adjustments. If the DM determines that one or more creatures did
not observe the initial attack, their first attacks automatically miss, too.
Note that intelligent opponents who have reason to suspect a character is
displaced might launch some type of probing attack to test the character-s defenses,
such as hurling a rock. Such attacks count as a combat action for the creatures
attempting them.

point of damage for every three rounds spent attacking the walls. If the
escalade rules from the <I>Player-s Option: Combat and Tactics</I> book are in play, the fortress can be attacked by bombardment engines or
sapped by attackers equipped with magical weapons. In either case, all damage is
subtracted from the fortress-s total hit points.

</I></B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Deck of Many Things: </I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Baneful effects from this item cannot be removed through <I>wishes</I> or lesser means, although a <I>wish</I> might indirectly help the PCs in dealing with the difficulties the cards
inflict. For example, a <I>wish</I> can reveal where a victim of the void or the donjon is imprisoned. A <I>wish</I> also could reveal the identity of an enemy produced by the flames or the
rogue.
<P></P>
10th-level magic is effective against a <I>deck of many things</I> in the same way a <I>wish</I> is, but there are certain exceptions. 10th-level divination spells cannot be
used to determine the identity of a particular card nor can magical wards
negate a card-s effects, but they can reveal the location of a creature trapped by
the void or donjon card. There is no way to shield a creature from the harmful
effects of the <I>deck of many things</I> while allowing the benefits to occur by using 10th-level spells.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</I></B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Extradimensional Spaces:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> These items tend to produce spectacular effects when one is placed within
another. The following items contain extradimensional spaces: <I>bag of holding, bag of transmuting, flatbox?, girdle of many pouches, Heward-s
handy haversack, portable hole</I>, and <I>pouch of accessibility</I>. The following spells produce extradimensional spaces: <I>extradimensional pocket?, Mordenkainen-s magnificent mansion</I>, and <I>rope trick</I>.
<P></P>
In most instances, placing one extradimensional space inside another opens a
rift to the Astral Plane, casting both the items and their contents through the
rift. The items and anything contained within them are scattered randomly in
the infinite depths of the Astral Plane. A <I>wish</I> can recover the contents of the extradimensional spaces, and it is possible
that creatures held in the items might eventually find their way off the Astral
Plane. Since all objects within the extradimensional space are scattered
randomly, a creature cast into the Astral Plane through a rift does not have any
better chance of recovering lost items than any other creature. A creature carried
to the Astral Plane through a rift retains its possessions, but other loose
items within the extradimensional space are randomly scattered.
<P></P>
For example, a party of adventurers decides to cast a <I>rope trick</I> spell to create a safe haven where they can rest and sort a huge pile of
coins they have found. Unfortunately, one of the characters has a <I>bag of holding</I> which contains several pieces of equipment and treasure. When the<I> bag of holding</I> enters the <I>rope trick</I>, both spaces are sucked into the Astral Plane. The characters occupying the<I> rope trick</I> are dumped in random locations in the Astral Plane (if the DM is feeling
kind, they might arrive within sight of each other). The<I> bag of holding</I> is torn from its holder-s grasp and its contents are spewed randomly across
astral space.
<P></P>
<I>Portable holes</I> can produce more dramatic effects. If another extradimensional space is
placed within a <I>portable hole</I>, an astral rift opens, as described above. However, if a <I>portable hole</I> is placed within another extradimensional space, a gate to a random plane
opens and all creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn through it, no saving
throw. The process destroys the <I>portable hole</I> and the other extradimensional space.
<P></P>
<I>Flatboxes</I> are notoriously unstable. If a <I>flatbox </I>contacts any other extradimensional space it explodes, see the <A HREF="DD01280.htm#0f6dc00f"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01280.htm#0f6dc00f">item description</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> for details. The other item is sucked into the Astral Plane. A <I>portable hole</I> reacts as detailed above.
<P></P>
Most extradimensional spaces contain only a finite amount of air, which limits
how long living creatures can be kept inside. Refer to the <A HREF="DD01280.htm#cda846cb"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01280.htm#cda846cb">bag of holding</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> entry for the amount of air contained within these items.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Creatures drawn through the gate created by a <I>portable hole</I> arrive in a random location and fall in a heap within a 10-foot radius. Items
in the extradimensional spaces are either lost on the Astral Plane (50%) or
scattered randomly about the circle where the creatures land (50%). The DM makes
the roll and can decide to check the items singly or in groups.

</I></B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Flatbox:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The box can hold 60 gallons of water. A creature inside one of these items
can breathe normally for six minutes if the lid is closed. Additional information

<P></P>
</I></B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Flight Items: </I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Characters using magical items that grant flight have a daily movement rate in
miles equal to twice the item-s flight speed. For example, characters aboard a
4-person <I>carpet of flying </I>travel 48 miles a day in clear weather.
<P></P>
The daily movement rate assumes 10 hours of flying time with ample rest stops;
it is not an altogether pleasant experience to fly (consider the effects of
rough air, unsteady seating, awkward body positioning, and exposure to weather).
Characters in a hurry can eliminate most rest periods and stay aloft longer,
spending 18?20 hours in the air and doubling the daily movement rate, but this
subjects the riders to the effects of a forced march (see <A HREF="PHB_DD01777.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01777.htm">Player-s Handbook</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, Chapter 14). Riders who stay aloft for 24 hours a day move at 2 1/2 times
their normal daily rate and suffer double force march penalties.
<P></P>
When a party has access to magical items that grant flight, the DM should take
special care to plan adventures that take this capability into account. Flying
characters can easily evade most land-based encounters, so the adventure
should include encounters with flying creatures or those that entice the characters
to land. The DM should also determine the prevailing weather conditions in
advance, as they affect both flying conditions and the party-s ability to see and
be seen while aloft.

successful attack roll to trap a target. A failed attack roll never entraps a
creature. An entrapped victim-s companions can attempt a bend bars/lift gates roll to
break the bands if the victim cannot get free. Spells such as<I> free action, wraithform, antimagic shell</I>, and <I>duo-dimension</I> are all effective means of escape, but teleportation magic merely transports
the trapped creature from one place to another with the bands still trapping
him. Magical items such as a <I>potion of slipperiness</I> or <I>ring of free action</I> are also effective against the magic of the bands.

</I></B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Periapt of Proof Against Poison:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This item has three basic functions, but only one can be active at any given
time. First, the periapt can allow a saving throw against poisons that normally
do not allow one. The required number for the saving throw varies with the
periapt-s strength as shown in the <A HREF="DMG_DD01016.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD01016.htm">Dungeon Master Guide</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. Other magical protections are added to the roll. For example, a character
with a <I>periapt of proof against poison +1</I> and a<I> ring of protection +1</I> would gain a saving throw of 18 against a toxin that normally allows no
saving throw. The bonus for the periapt does not apply in cases where no saving
throw is normally allowed.
<P></P>
Second, the periapt negates any penalty a particularly strong toxin might
impose. Note that the penalty is entirely negated, not merely subtracted from the
periapt-s bonus. For example, a particularly virulent poison might have a ?4
penalty to all saving throws. Even a <I>periapt of proof against poison +1</I> completely negates the penalty. Likewise, a poison with a ?1 penalty to
saving throws completely negates the bonus of a +4 periapt.
<P></P>
Third, the periapt grants a general bonus to normal saving throws against
poisons. The bonuses are cumulative with other magical protections (but see the
automatic failure rule on <A HREF="DD01352.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01352.htm">page 142</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">).

</I></B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Potions:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Once a potion, elixir, oil, or ointment takes effect on a creature, any
effects that apply only to the imbiber cannot be removed unless a <I>dispel magic</I> is targeted directly at the creature. If the potion-s effects extend to other
creatures (such as the various potions of control) it can be dispelled
normally. All potion effects are treated as magic cast at 12th level for purposes of
dispelling.
<P></P>
Potions consumed within an <I>antimagic shell</I> do not activate until they leave the area of effect. If a potion has been
consumed, an <I>antimagic shell</I> suppresses its effects unless they are permanent in nature (such as a <I>potion of healing</I>). Temporary effects made permanent by a roll on the potion compatibility
table from the <A HREF="DMG_DD00702.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00702.htm">DMG</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> can be suppressed by an <I>antimagic shell</I>.
<P></P>
Tasting a potion gives the character a minor clue as to the potion-s effects.
For example, a <I>potion of levitation</I> or a <I>potion of flying</I> might make the character feel light. Often the effect from tasting a potion
is not immediately obvious, and the character must attempt some action before
any effects are revealed. In the previous example, the taster might feel nothing
initially but might walk with a bouncing gait or feel light-footed when
walking. A potion-s taste, smell, and texture might help identify it, but this tends
to be unreliable because potions with identical effects can look, feel, smell,
and taste differently if they were made in different laboratories or concocted
at different times.

others desire. The wearer does not necessarily do the exact opposite of what is
suggested. For example, if someone says -keep that ring on,? the wearer
wholeheartedly agrees. He might also suddenly become fearful that others desire the
ring and attack the speaker. The ring-s enchantment makes the wearer difficult to
be around, always selecting the response that is most troublesome.

regenerate back to life. However, damage inflicted by such attacks can be regenerated if
the wearer survives the attack.
<P></P>
A <I>ring of regeneration</I> only repairs damage inflicted on the wearer after the character puts on the
ring. Damage inflicted before the character wore the ring is not regenerated, so
placing a <I>ring of regeneration</I> on a dead or unconscious character has no effect.
<P></P>
A <I>ring of regeneration</I> does not remove the need to eat, sleep, or breathe, nor does it prevent
natural or unnatural aging.

</I></B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Rod of Absorption:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Spell levels stored in the rod can be used to power spells on low-magic
worlds, even when local conditions would not normally allow the spell to be cast.
For example, if the rod-wielder had a <I>wall of force</I> spell memorized, the character could use five levels of stored energy even on
an M4 world, where 5th level spells normally don-t work (see <A HREF="DD01231.htm#ef18ea52"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01231.htm#ef18ea52">page 47</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">).
<P></P>
When used to absorb spells, the rod can absorb any spells directed at the
wielder for the entire round, as selected by the rod-wielder. Absorbing spells
counts as an action for the character, but initiative has no bearing on when a
spell can be absorbed. The wielder can never absorb a spell that is not targeted
specifically at him.
<P></P>
For example, if the wielder is caught in the blast of a <I>fireball</I>, the rod cannot be used to absorb the spell because the wielder was not the
target-the actual target was a point in space. If, however, the <I>fireball</I> was set to detonate directly on the wielder, it could be absorbed. Some
spells, such as <I>hold person</I> and <I>slow</I>, are individually targeted on multiple creatures within an area. If the
rod-wielder is one of those targets, he can absorb the entire spell.
<P></P>
Absorbed spells have no effect whatsoever; their power has been stored in the
rod. Thus, if a<I> hold person</I> is directed at the rod-wielder, the magic is totally negated-even for other
targets. 10th-level spells cannot be absorbed.

limitations included in the item description, all the rope-s targets must fit
within a single area of 200 square feet or less (eight 5-foot squares in any
contiguous configuration). Targets who save vs. breath weapon can move 10 feet each
round and can attack nearby creatures (but not the <I>rope of entanglement</I>).
<P></P>
If other creatures fail their saving throw versus the rope, those who
succeeded in their save can only move if the combined weight of those who failed is
less than their maximum press. For instance, a fighter wearing a <I>girdle of hill giant strength</I> could drag up to 640 lbs. of weight along with him. Of course, groups of
creatures must move generally the same direction to initiate an attack.
<P></P>
Entwined creatures suffer a +2 initiative penalty and attacks against them are
at +2. Targets who fail the save are held completely immobile and cannot
perform any actions that require movement; attacks against immobile creatures are
made with a +4 bonus.

</I></B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Spell Scrolls:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A scroll is a temporary magical writing that stores spell energy in a
portable form; it is essentially a pre-cast spell waiting to be triggered. The level
at which a priest spell read from scroll functions is never diminished due to
planar distances (see <A HREF="DD01231.htm#ef18ea52"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01231.htm#ef18ea52">page 49</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">), but all scroll spells are subject to local conditions. For example, a <I>fireball</I> read from a scroll is ineffective on the Plane of Elemental Water-the spell
creates a harmless bubble of vapor and the writing fades. Scrolls become inert
if taken to a world rated M2 (see <A HREF="DD01231.htm#ef18ea52"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01231.htm#ef18ea52">page 47</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">) or lower, but are not otherwise harmed.
<P></P>
Spell scrolls come in two types, priest and wizard. Priests cannot use wizard
scrolls and vice versa. High-level thieves and bards have a chance to employ
either type. A character who can use spell scrolls can read any spell of the
appropriate type regardless of other restrictions. For example, an illusionist, who
is normally barred from casting abjuration spells, can <I>read a dispel magic</I> spell from a scroll. Likewise, a priest can read priest spells from spheres
normally unavailable. Note that the reader could still suffer the effects of
spell failure by attempting to cast a spell that is too high a level (see <A HREF="DMG_DD00699.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00699.htm">Dungeon Master Guide</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, Appendix 3).

additional bonuses for being higher level or having an Intelligence/Reason
score greater than 18.
<P></P>
A <I>talisman of the sphere doubles</I> a wizard-s Intelligence bonus for controlling the sphere. Adjusted control
scores of 100% or more indicate automatic success, but other wizards trying to

</I></B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Staff of the Magi:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The staff-s plane travel ability is similar to the priest spell <I>plane shift</I>, but no forked rod is required. The staff-wielder must be generally familiar
with the destination plane either by making a previous visit or having
information about the plane from a traveler who has been there. If a character wishes
to research details on an unknown plane, refer to the note at <A HREF="DD01279.htm#75ef40cf"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01279.htm#75ef40cf">plane shift</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> for cost and time requirements.
<P></P>
The absorption power of the staff works just like that of the <I>rod of absorption</I> except that the level of absorbed spell is not communicated to the
staff-wielder. The decision to absorb must be made based on the appearance of the magic
or, in the case of invisible effects, blind luck.

</I></B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Staff of Withering:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The withering effect from this item makes one of the victim-s limbs shriveled
and useless; it has no effect on a creature-s head or body. The withering
effect requires three charges from the staff and must be announced at the beginning
of the round. If the staff hits, roll randomly to see which limb is struck.
<P></P>
If the victim is humanoid, roll 1d4 to determine which limb is struck: 1=right
arm, 2=left arm, 3=right leg, and 4=left leg. A shriveled arm cannot wield a
weapon or shield or be used to make unarmed attacks. The character suffers a ?2
penalty to Dexterity for each shriveled arm. A humanoid cannot stand up or walk
without a crutch if even one leg is shriveled. The character is reduced to a
crawl and cannot make any physical attacks. The character suffers a ?6 penalty
to Dexterity. Getting two legs shriveled has no appreciable additional effect.
<P></P>
If the target is a quadruped, the staff-wielder can usually reach only two of
the opponent-s limbs. Roll 1d6 to see which one is hit: 1?3=right, 4?6=left.
Quadrupeds with one shriveled leg move at 2/3 their normal rate and cannot make
attacks with the shriveled limb. A quadruped with two shriveled limbs cannot
move or physically attack.
<P></P>
Insectoid or multi-limbed creatures should be handled like quadrupeds, but
their movement is unaffected as long as they have at least two functioning limbs
on each side of the body.
<P></P>
Attacks on flying creatures can hit the wings. For example, roll 1d6 to
determine which limb on a flying humanoid is struck: 1=right arm, 2=left arm, 3=right
leg, 4=left leg, 5=right wing, and 6=left wing. Creatures with even one
shriveled wing cannot fly.
<P></P>
Limbless creatures have no appendages to be withered and suffer no ill effects
from withering except damage and aging.
<P></P>
If the staff-wielder chooses to make a called shot and succeeds, do not make a
random roll; the staff hits the selected area instead.
<P></P>
If the critical hit rules from <I>Player-s Option: Combat and Tactics</I> are in use, ignore all of the foregoing and use the hit location system from
that book. The area struck suffers a -destroyed? result if the saving throw
fails, even if it is not a limb (do not roll for severity). The staff-wielder does
not need to score a critical hit to roll for hit location. If the
staff-wielder does score a critical hit, the target suffers double damage and must roll
saving throws vs. both the withering and the critical hit.
<P></P>
There are several ways to repair withered limbs, but <I>regenerate </I>and <I>restoration</I> are the most common methods. Creatures that regenerate (through an innate
ability or magical item) regain the use of a shriveled limb after regenerating the
equivalent of 20 points of damage. For example, a character wearing a <I>ring of regeneration</I> would recover from a shriveled limb in 20 turns, and a troll would recover in
seven rounds.

bonus applies to saving throws, ability checks used as saving throws, system shock

skill, is the determining factor. The bonus does not apply to spell failure,
magical item creation, learning spells, or to most proficiency checks.
