When this spell is cast, it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at
a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has three major
effects:
<P></P>
First, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the
protected creature receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll, and any saving
throws caused by such attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus.
<P></P>
Second, any attempt to exercise mental control over the protected creature
(if, for example, it has been charmed by a vampire) or to invade and take over its
mind (as by a ghost's magic jar attack) is blocked by this spell. Note that
the protection does not prevent a vampire's charm itself, nor end it, but it does
prevent the vampire from exercising mental control through the barrier.
Likewise, an outside life force is merely kept out, and would not be expelled if in
place before the protection was cast.
<P></P>
Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by creatures of an extraplanar or
conjured nature (such as aerial servants, elementals, imps, invisible stalkers,
salamanders, water weirds, xorn, and others). This causes the natural (body)
weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creature to recoil if such attacks
require touching the protected creature. Animals or monsters summoned or
conjured by spells or similar magic are likewise hedged from the character. This
protection ends if the protected character makes a melee attack against or tries
to force the barrier against the blocked creature.
<P></P>
To complete this spell, the priest uses holy water or burning incense.
<P></P>
This spell can be reversed to become <I>protection from good</I>, with the second and third benefits remaining unchanged.
<P></P>
The material components for the reverse are a circle of unholy water or
smoldering dung.
