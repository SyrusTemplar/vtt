Many AD&amp;D game players are familiar with the character kits in the <I>Player’s Handbook</I> Rules Supplement series. <I>Player’s Option</I> kits are different. They are packages of descriptions, proficiencies,
benefits, and hindrances that help flesh out characters. In short, the kits give
adventurers background and depth.

<I>Player’s Option</I> kits are available to more characters than previouly published kits are. No

rogues aren’t the only characters who can excel as acrobats. With some
exceptions, a character of any class can choose any kit. Many <I>Player’s Option</I> kits are linked to the social ranks system presented below.
