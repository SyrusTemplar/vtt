<TITLE>Gem of Retaliation-- Miscellaneous Magic (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Gem of Retaliation:</B> The holder of this gem gains a special protection against Evocation spells
directed at him. The owner of the gem gains a +4 bonus to any saving throw made
against such a spell, and also acquires a base save of 18 (but not the +4 bonus)
against any Evocation spell which normally does not allow a saving throw (such
as <I>ice storm</I>). All standard modifiers (<I>ring of protection</I>, Dexterity, etc.) apply.
<P></P>
Additionally, if the saving throw is successful, the incoming spell is
converted into outgoing <I>magic missiles</I>. The number of missiles is equal to one-half the level of the spell negated,
rounding fractions up. The <I>magic missiles</I> then streak back to strike the person or creature who cast the spell at the
owner of the gem. Maximum range for this strike is 160 yards.
<P></P>
Spell-like effects created from magical items are not affected by the <I>gem of retaliation</I> (thus, a <I>wand of magic missiles</I> will function normally against someone using this gem).
<P></P>
An individual holding a <I>gem of retaliation</I> who comes under attack by an area spell (<I>fireball, ice storm</I>, etc.) gains the advantages as described above. Other persons in the area of
effect suffer all effects normally. Even if the gem's owner saves successfully,
the area-effect Evocation is <I>not</I> transformed into <I>magic missiles</I> as described previously.
<P></P>
