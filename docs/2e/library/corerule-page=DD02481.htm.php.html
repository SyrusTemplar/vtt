A character can declare that she is using one of her attacks to block an
opponent’s strike. Blocking is a hard parry with a weapon that deflects an
opponent’s attack. Any weapon except rope-like things such as nets, lassoes, or slings
can be used to block.
<P></P>
When a character tries to block an attack, she makes a normal attack roll
against AC 4. Her opponent makes a normal attack roll against her Armor Class. The
strike is blocked if the character succeeds with a lower roll than her enemy
succeeded with. If the attacker failed anyway, it’s a miss no matter what the
blocking character rolled. If the blocking character failed but her attacker
succeeded, it’s a hit despite the block attempt.

<I>For example, Arweth is a 5th-level fighter with an adjusted THAC0 of 14 with
her long sword. She is fighting a hill giant with a THAC0 of 9. Arweth decides
to use an attack to block the hill giant’s next strike. She rolls a 15 and
succeeds with her roll. The hill giant rolls a 12; Arweth is AC 1, so the giant
succeeds, too. His roll of 12 is lower than her 15, so Arweth’s block fails.

</I> If the character announces her block before initiative is rolled, she can
block an attack even if it beats her action phase. If she decides to wait, she can
only block attacks in her action phase or later.
<P></P>
Blocking is an excellent tactic for characters with multiple attacks to use
against characters or monsters with only one attack. A rapier specialist with a
main-gauche in her off hand can use her off-hand weapon or one of the rapier
attacks to block while using the rest of her attacks offensively.
