A wizard's ability to speak can be impaired as a result of disease, magic
(such as a <I>silence</I> spell), or physical damage. A gagged wizard will also be unable to speak. No
spell with a verbal component can be cast by a wizard with impaired speech; he
must be able to enunciate each phrase or sound of a spell's verbal component
clearly and distinctly for the spell to be successful. <I>Ventriloquism </I>cannot substitute for an impaired-speech wizard's voice when he attempts to
speak a spell's verbal component; <I>ventriloquism</I> is useless to a speech-impaired wizard, since it is an extension of sounds
the wizard is normally able to make.
<P></P>
Similarly, an impaired-speech wizard cannot use his familiar to speak verbal
components, including those familiars capable of speech, since spells only
operate if the wizard himself utters their verbal components.
<P></P>
However, an impaired-speech wizard can use the spell <I>vocalize</I> to allow him to cast spells that normally require a verbal component. Casting
these spells must take place within the duration of the <I>vocalize </I>spell. (For more about vocalize, see <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD06212.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD06212.htm.php.html">Chapter 9</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">. ) According to the <I>Player's Handbook</I> (Nicholes 85-86), the use of components is an optional rule. If components
aren't used for spell casting in your campaign, it is assumed that the caster
must be able to speak in order to cast any spell (see the first paragraph in the
Casting Spells section on <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01652.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01652.htm.php.html">page 85</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> of the <I>PH </I>).<I> Vocalize</I> can still help a speech-impaired wizard if the components rules are not in
use; otherwise, all of the rules for speech-impaired wizards apply.
