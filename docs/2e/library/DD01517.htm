</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Like law and order, the second set of attitudes is also divided into three
parts. These parts describe, more or less, a character's moral outlook; they are
his internal guideposts to what is right or wrong.
<P></P>
Good characters are just that. They try to be honest, charitable, and
forthright. People are not perfect, however, so few are good all the time. There are
always occasional failings and weaknesses. A good person, however, worries about
his errors and normally tries to correct any damage done.
<P></P>
Remember, however, that goodness has no absolute values. Although many things
are commonly accepted as good (helping those in need, protecting the weak),
different cultures impose their own interpretations on what is good and what is
evil.
<P></P>
Those with a neutral moral stance often refrain from passing judgment on
anything. They do not classify people, things, or events as good or evil; what is,
is. In some cases, this is because the creature lacks the capacity to make a
moral judgment (animals fall into this category). Few normal creatures do anything
for good or evil reasons. They kill because they are hungry or threatened.
They sleep where they find shelter. They do not worry about the moral consequences
of their actions--their actions are instinctive.
<P></P>
Evil is the antithesis of good and appears in many ways, some overt and others
quite subtle. Only a few people of evil nature actively seek to cause harm or
destruction. Most simply do not recognize that what they do is destructive or
disruptive. People and things that obstruct the evil character's plans are mere
hindrances that must be overcome. If someone is harmed in the process... well,
that's too bad. Remember that evil, like good, is interpreted differently in
different societies.
