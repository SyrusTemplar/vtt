<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Lycanthropy is not the only type of weird and magical affliction that can
strike a character. Filthy rats can carry disease. Mummies possess the dangerous
rotting touch. In each case there are effects set out in the description in the <I>Monstrous Compendium.</I> However, it is important for the DM to distinguish between normal and magical
diseases.
<P></P>
A normal disease is one that no matter how exotic or fantastic is caused and
transmitted in ways we normally understandâ€”germs, mosquitoes, rabid rats, etc.
To that end, the disease would be treatable by normal methods in the real world.
<P></P>
<P></P>
A magical disease, like rotting touch, is one that functions by some
unexplained magical property. As such it is not curable by normal means.
<P></P>
The DM should understand the distinction between the two types of diseases.
With that knowledge, he can rule on the effects of various cures and potions.
