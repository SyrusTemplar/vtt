<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Incense of Meditation:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The small rectangular blocks of sweet-smelling <I>incense of meditation</I> are indistinguishable from nonmagical incense until one is lit. When burning,
the special fragrance and pearly-hued smoke of this special incense are
recognizable by any priest of 5th or higher level.
<P></P>
When a priest lights a block of the incense of meditation and spends eight
hours praying and meditating nearby, the incense will enable him to gain maximum
spell effects. Thus, <I>cure wounds</I> spells are always maximum, spell effects are of the broadest area possible,
and saving throws against their effects suffer -1 penalties, and when dead are
brought back to life, their chance of not surviving is reduced by one-half
(rounded down).
<P></P>
When this item of magic is discovered, there will be 2d4 pieces of incense.
Each piece burns for eight hours, the effects remain for 24 hours.
