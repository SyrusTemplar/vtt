The spells are organized according to their group (priest or wizard) and
level. Within each level, the spells are arranged alphabetically. At the start of
each spell description are the following important game statistics:
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Name:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Each spell is identified by name. In parentheses after the name is the school
(for wizard spells) to which that spell belongs. When more than one is listed,
that spell is common to all schools given.
<P></P>
Some spells are reversible (they can be cast for an effect opposite to that of
the standard spell). This is noted after the spell name. Priests with
reversible spells must memorize the desired version. For example, a priest who desires
a <I>cause light wounds</I> spell must petition for this form of the spell when meditating and praying.
Note that severe penalties can result if the spell choice is at variance with
the priest's alignment (possible penalties include denial of specific spells,
entire spell levels, or even all spells for a certain period). The exact result
(if any) depends on the reaction of the priest's patron deity, as determined by
the DM.
<P></P>
Reversible wizard spells operate similarly. When the spell is learned, both
forms are recorded in the wizard's spell books. However, the wizard must decide
which version of the spell he desires to cast when memorizing the spell, unless
the spell description specifically states otherwise. For example, a wizard who
has memorized <I>stone to flesh</I> and desires to cast <I>flesh to stone</I> must wait until the latter form of the spell can be memorized (i.e., rest
eight hours and study). If he can memorize two 6th-level spells, he could memorize
each version once or one version twice.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>School:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">In parentheses after the spell name is the name of the school of magic to
which the spell belongs. For wizard spells, this defines which spells a wizard
specialist can learn, depending on the wizard's school of specialization. For
priest spells, the school notation is used only for reference purposes, to indicate
which school the spell is considered to belong to, in case the DM needs to know
for spell resistance (for example, elves' resistance to charm spells).
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sphere:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This entry appears only for priest spells and identifies the sphere or spheres
into which each spell falls.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Range:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This lists the distance from the caster at which the spell effect occurs or
begins. A “0” indicates the spell can be used on the caster only, with the effect
embodied within or emanating from him. “Touch” means the caster can use the
spell on others if he can physically touch them. Unless otherwise specified, all
other spells are centered on a point visible to the caster and within the range
of the spell. The point can be a creature or object if desired. In general, a
spell that affects a limited number of creatures within an area affects those
closest to the center first, unless there are other parameters operating (such
as level or Hit Dice). Spells can be cast through narrow openings only if both
the caster's vision and the spell energy can be directed simultaneously through
the opening. A wizard standing behind an arrow slit can cast through it;
sending a fireball through a small peephole he is peering through is another matter.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Components:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This lists the category of components needed, V for verbal, S for somatic, and
M for material. When material components are required, these are listed in the
spell description. Spell components are expended as the spell is cast, unless
otherwise noted. Clerical holy symbols are not lost when a spell is cast. For
cases in which material components are expended at the end of the spell (<I>free action, shapechange,</I> etc.), premature destruction of the components ends the spell.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Duration:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This lists how long the magical energy of the spell lasts. Spells of
instantaneous duration come and go the moment they are cast, although the results of
these spells may be permanent and unchangeable by normal means. Spells of
permanent duration last until the effects are negated by some means, usually by a <I>dispel magic</I>. Some spells have a variable duration. The caster cannot choose the duration
of spells, in most cases. Spells with set durations (for example, 3 rounds per
level of the wizard) must be kept track of by the player. Spells of variable
duration (for example, 3+1d4 rounds) are secretly recorded by the DM. Your DM may
warn you when spell durations are approaching expiration, but there is usually
no sign that a spell is going to expire; check with your DM to determine
exactly how he handles this issue.
<P></P>
Certain spells can be ended at will by the caster. In order to dismiss these
spells, the original caster must be within range of the spell's center of
effect--within the same range at which the spell can be cast. The caster also must be
able to speak words of dismissal. Note that only the original caster can
dismiss his spells in this way.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Casting Time:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This entry is important, if the optional casting time modifier to initiative
is used. If only a number is given, the casting time is added to the caster's
initiative die rolls. If the spell requires a round or number of rounds to cast,
it goes into effect at the end of the last round of casting time. If Delsenora
casts a spell that takes one round, it goes into effect at the end of the round
in which she begins casting. If the spell requires three rounds to cast, it
goes into effect at the end of the third round. Spells requiring a turn or more
go into effect at the end of the stated turn.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Area of Effect:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This lists the creatures, volume, dimensions, weight, etc., that can be
affected by the spell. Spells with an area or volume that can be shaped by the caster
will, unless the spell description specifically states otherwise, have a
minimum dimension of 10 feet in any direction. Thus, a cloud that has a 10-foot cube
per caster level might, when cast by a 12th-level caster, be 10-foot x 10-foot
x 120-foot, 20-foot x 20-foot x 30-foot, or any similar combination that
totals 12 10-foot cubes. Combinations such as 5-foot x 10-foot x 240-foot are not
possible unless specifically stated.
<P></P>
Some spells (such as <I>bless</I>) affect the friends or enemies of the caster. In all cases, this refers to
the perception of the caster at the time the spell is cast. For example, a
chaotic good character allied with a lawful neutral cleric would receive the benefits
of the latter's <I>bless</I> spell.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Saving Throw:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This lists whether the spell allows the target a saving throw and explains the
effect of a successful save: “Neg.” results in the spell having no effect; “½”
means the character suffers half the normal amount of damage; “none” means no
saving throw is allowed. Wisdom adjustments to saving throws apply only to
enchantment/charm spells.
<P></P>
Solid physical barriers provide saving throw bonuses and damage reduction.
Cover and concealment may affect saving throws and damage (the DM has additional
information about this).
<P></P>
A creature that successfully saves against a spell with no apparent physical
effect (such as a <I>charm, hold,</I> or <I>magic jar</I>) may feel a definite force or tingle that is characteristic of a magical
attack, if the DM desires. But the exact hostile spell effect or creature ability
used cannot be deduced from this tingle.
<P></P>
A being's carried equipment and possessions are assumed to make their saving
throws against special attacks if the creature makes its saving throw, unless
the spell specifically states otherwise. If the creature fails its saving throw,
or if the attack form is particularly potent, saving throws may have to be
rolled to see if any possessions survive, using either item saving throws (see
Chapter 6 of the <A HREF="DMG_DD00331.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00331.htm">DMG</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">) or the being's saving throw. The DM will inform you when this happens.
<P></P>
Any character can voluntarily forgo a saving throw. This allows a spell or
similar attack that normally grants a saving throw to have full effect on the
character. Likewise, any creature can voluntarily lower its magic resistance,
allowing a spell to automatically function when cast on it. Foregoing a saving throw
or magic resistance roll need not always be voluntary. If a creature or
character can be tricked into lowering its resistance, the spell will have full
effect, even if it is not the spell the victim believed he was going to receive. The
victim must consciously choose to lower his resistance; it is not sufficient
that he is caught off guard.
<P></P>
For example, a character would receive a saving throw if a wizard in the party
suddenly attacked him with a fireball, even if the wizard had been friendly to
that point. However, the same character would not receive a saving throw if
the wizard convinced him that he was about to receive a <I>levitation</I> spell but cast a fireball instead. Your DM will decide when NPCs have lowered
their resistances. You must tell your DM when your character is lowering his
resistance.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Spell Description:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The text provides a complete description of how the spell functions and its
game effects. It covers most typical uses of the spell, if there are more than
one, but cannot deal with every possible application players might find. In these
cases, the spell information in the text should provide guidance on how to
adjudicate the situation.
<P></P>
Spells with multiple functions enable the caster to select which function he
wants to use at the time of casting. Usually a single function of a
multiple-function spell is weaker than a single-function spell of the same level.
<P></P>
Spell effects that give bonuses or penalties to abilities, attack rolls,
damage rolls, saving throws, etc., are not usually cumulative with each other or
with other magic: The strongest single effect applies. For example, a fighter
drinks a <I>potion of giant strength</I> and then receives the 2nd-level wizard spell <I>strength</I>. Only the strongest magic (the potion) is effective. When the potion's
duration ends, however, the <I>strength</I> spell is still in effect, until its duration also expires.
