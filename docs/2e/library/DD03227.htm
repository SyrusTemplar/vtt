<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Meditative Focus:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This proficiency allows a psionicist to focus his mental energy into one
discipline, causing all powers within that discipline to receive MTHAC0 roll
bonuses; powers related to other disciplines receive MTHAC0 roll penalties.
<P></P>
The psionicist must meditate for 12 consecutive hours. He recovers PSPs
normally during this meditative state. When the period ends, the character makes a
proficiency check. Success means he has focused his energy into the chosen
discipline. All MTHAC0 rolls for powers within that discipline receive a +2 bonus for
the next 24 hours or until his PSP total is reduced to 0, whichever comes
first. All other disciplines get a â€“1 penalty for the same period.
