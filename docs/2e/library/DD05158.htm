There's a misconception that warriors are just square, solid guys who do the
physical work in a fight; that rogues are the clever ones who do all the
conniving and tricking; that wizards are awesome, impersonal intelligence dedicated
solely to their magical studies; that priests are only interested in the
advancement of one's spiritual learning.
<P></P>
While that's a simplification convenient for first-time players of the game,
more experienced players may desire to add depth to their characters by
providing more detail to their characters' personalities: Deciding how they react in
certain situations, how they relate to other characters, and so forth.
<P></P>
Experienced role-players, those who already do this, should skip down to the
headline reading &quot;The Warrior Campaign.&quot; Beginning role-players should continue
from here.

In the first part of this chapter, we'll be talking about Warrior
Personalities, describing a few types of heroes common to fiction and mythology. Read each
description, think about whether the description comes close to matching your
conception about your character's personality, and if it does, try to utilize
that description's advice when role-playing and making decisions for your
character.
<P></P>
Each personality in this chapter will be described in the following way:
<P></P>
<B>Character Description:</B> These paragraphs talk about the character's attitudes and motivations, and
how the character tends to act and interact in a normal campaign.
<P></P>
<B>Best Suited For:</B> These paragraphs talk about the alignments for which this personality type is
best suited, and about the Warrior Kits (from the last chapter) for which the
personality is best suited. It's possible to come up with a good rationale for
why a character of a specific personality type should have an alignment that
doesn't (at first glance) seem appropriate for that personality type, so there is <I>absolutely no firm alignment restriction when you're choosing personalities.</I> However, the recommendations made for appropriate choices are good enough for
most characters, so keep them in mind.
<P></P>
<B>In Combat Situations:</B> These paragraphs talk about how the character reacts in combat situations.
Not all warriors unstrap their swords and wade in swinging; some approach battle
situations more slowly, more cleverly, or more aggressively.
<P></P>
<B>In Role-Playing Situations:</B> These paragraphs talk about the character's general reactions to NPCs in
role-playing situations; you can use them as general guidelines for your
character's role-playing conversations and other such encounters.
