Characters skilled in camouflage understand how to stay out of sight in
natural surroundings. Unlike hiding in shadows, camouflage requires one of two
things: good cover nearby or a lot of preparation. It-s possible for a character to
hide himself on a flat, rocky desert, but he-d need to have special clothes and
time to ready a hiding spot. On the other hand, almost anyone can duck behind a
tree on short notice.

If the character passes his camouflage check, he is considered to be
effectively <I>invisible</I> as long as he doesn-t move. He can avoid encounters if he chooses, or gain a
?1 bonus on his chance to surprise someone who doesn-t spot him. The
character-s check is modified as noted below:

Rangers and thieves gain a +40% to their chance to hide in shadows if they
pass a camouflage check in conjunction with their attempt to hide in shadows.
