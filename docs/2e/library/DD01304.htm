</B>Magical Items and Preexisting Spells
<P></P>

<P></P>
Because a dueling arena is a mental construct, it is not possible to carry any
sort of equipment into it; the opponents enter the arena only in their minds.
Certain items, however, can affect the course of a duel.
<P></P>
Items that actually store spells or spell energy can be employed to create
spells during a duel. Such items include<I> rings of spell storing,</I> magical scrolls, and <I>rods of absorption</I>. A <I>scroll of protection</I> creates a defensive effect with a power rank of 15 and a movement of 1.
<P></P>
Items that create spell-like effects usually cannot be used in a duel. Such
items include all wands, staves, potions, and miscellaneous magical items, as
well as most rods. The combatants, however, can agree in advance to incorporate
such items into a duel. The arena must be altered to allow the items to function,
and an additional turn of preparation time is required for each class of item
to be allowed. If only one particular item is to be allowed, an extra turn of
preparation is required.
<P></P>
For example, Delsenora and Calvin decide to have a friendly spellcasting
contest, but Calvin wishes to employ his <I>wand of conjuration</I> in the duel. If the pair spends two turns creating the arena, either
character could use any wand. If the pair spends three turns preparing, only Calvin’s <I>wand of conjuration</I> can affect the duel—the extra time might be well worth Calvin’s patience.
<P></P>
A spell-like effect from an item works just like the spell it simulates. When
in doubt, the item creates a leech effect that inflicts a maximum of 6d6 points
of damage. A leech from a staff drains a maximum of 8d6 dice of damage, while
other items inflict a maximum of 9d6 points of damage. An effect from a device
uses the device level to determine the saving throw, not the wielder’s level
(see <A HREF="DD01356.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01356.htm">page 144</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">).
<P></P>
Magical bonuses for protective devices, such as enchanted armor and<I> rings of protection</I>, increase the wearer’s power score against spells, but not for personal
combat. For example, a priest with a power score of 11 wearing plate<I> armor +2</I> and a <I>ring of protection +1</I> has an adjusted power score of 14 against spells. Armor class has no effect
on a duel; items such as <I>bracers of defense</I> do not help the wearer. Defensive bonuses to saving throws apply to any
saving throw the character makes in the duel. Magical armor can provide saving throw
bonuses against missiles and attack/defense spells (see <A HREF="DMG_DD00462.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00462.htm">DMG</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, Chapter 9).
<P></P>
Attack bonuses from magical weapons increase the character’s power score for
personal combat, but not against spells. In other words, magical weapons only
help when the two magical constructs engage in melee combat instead of casting
spells at each other.
<P></P>
Effects from other magical items and spells that are activated and in place on
a character when an arena is constructed usually have no effect on a duel.
However, the arena can be constructed to allow them to operate. An extra turn of
preparation time is required for each effect to be incorporated. Once
incorporated, an effect remains in place until it is dispelled or its duration expires.
<P></P>
A preexisting effect can profoundly influence on a duel. For example, a <I>minor globe of invulnerability</I> makes the protected character immune to all 1st- through 3rd-level spells.
The globe can be dispelled, but a dispel magic spell would have to reach the
character’s space before it could take effect. A simple <I>protection from evil</I> spell renders the recipient immune to any attack/defense spell that summons
creatures. Characters should exercise considerable care before agreeing to allow
an opponent to enter the arena with a magical effect already in place. The
durations for all preexisting conditions begin on the first round of a duel, not
when the spell is initially cast during the arena creation process.
<P></P>
Certain magical effects prevent an arena from being formed; these include the
spells <I>antimagic shell</I>, <I>prismatic sphere, Otiluke’s resilient sphere, Otiluke’s telekinetic sphere</I>, any wall spell, and <I>scrolls of protection from magic</I>. None of these effects can be incorporated into an arena, even if both
opponents agree.
