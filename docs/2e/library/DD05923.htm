A roll on Table 21 can be used to determine the availability of standard,
non-magical equipment items. This reflects how well the Guild is equipped with
illegal items, or equipment which is of dubious legality (and which may be illegal
in highly lawful societies). Add +1 to the dice roll for every 10 thieves in
the guild to a maximum of +4 for a guild with 40 or more thieves.

A roll indicating Poor means that illegal items (as shown in Table 31) cost
50-80% (40+{d4x10}) more than usual, and are at least 50% likely not to be
available at any given time. Items which are noted in Table 31 as being rare will be
almost impossible to obtain. A thief wanting an illegal item which is &quot;out of
stock&quot; can only try again after a gap of 2 weeks to see if fresh supplies have
been obtained. If the availability of resources is Fair, the item costs 10-40%
more than usual and there is a 30% chance that it is unavailable, but the thief
can make a weekly check.
<P></P>
A roll indicating Average allows items to be had for the usual price, with
only a 15% chance that an item is unavailable (a check for fresh deliveries being
made weekly). If the roll shows Good availability, prices are 10% below normal,
and items are only 5% likely to be unavailable at any time (check for fresh
deliveries weekly).
<P></P>
These rules, especially on availability, can be readily tweaked by the DM as
desired. If the DM wishes to deny the thief some equipment item, then it simply
isn't there, for example. Conversely, the DM may wish to rule that there are
always lockpicks available, since these are so essential for very basic thief
skills (picking locks, and maybe finding and removing certain types of traps).
