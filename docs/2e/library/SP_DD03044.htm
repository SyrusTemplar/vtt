<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Etiquette:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Characters with this skill are familiar with the typical manners of formal
interaction-at least as they relate to the culture in the campaign world. They
know what fanfares are required to greet royal visitors, how to seat the lords
and ladies at a table, how to organize the reception line, and how everyone is to
be addressed. None of these tasks require a proficiency check.
<P></P>
When dealing with a foreign or completely unknown culture, the characters must
pass proficiency checks to correctly gauge the required etiquette. The check
should be modified?+2 if the foreigners are the same race as the character, +1
or more if the character has had some time to observe the foreigners.
<P></P>
Characters with the empathy trait gain a +2 bonus to their rating with this
proficiency.
