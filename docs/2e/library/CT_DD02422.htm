When a larger creature attempts to move into a smaller, standing enemy’s
square, it is called an overrun. Mounted figures use their mount’s size for this
purpose, so a human on a size L horse can overrun a human on foot. Overruns create
an attack of opportunity for the figure being stepped on. After the defender’s
attack, the defender must roll a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation or
be knocked down. Even if he does successfully save, he is forced one square away
from his current location. This save is modified by a –4 penalty for a
creature two sizes larger than the defender, a –8 penalty for a creature three sizes
larger, etc.

<I> For example, a halfling (size S) gets in an ogre’s way. After the halfing’s
attack of opportunity, he must roll a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation or
be knocked down. The ogre is two sizes larger, so the saving throw is rolled
with a –4 penalty. Even if the halfling successfully saves, he is forced out of
the square.

</I> When a defender is knocked down by an overrunning creature, he may suffer a
trampling attack. The trampler gets an attack of opportunity that inflicts 1d4
points of damage per difference in size. Even though the defender is prone, no
modifiers apply; trampling is an afterthought on the attacker’s part. The DM can
adjust the damage as he sees fit; very dense creatures such as clay or stone
golems may not be seriously hurt by even a giant’s trample.

<P></P>
<I> Continuing our example, the halfling fails his saving throw and is knocked
flat by the ogre’s rush. The ogre gets a free attack of opportunity and rolls a
hit. Since there is a two-category difference in size between them, the halfling
suffers 2d4 points of damage. Being trampled by someone ten times your weight
can be lethal.

</I> A prone creature with an enemy in its square may get up by using a full-move
action. Since two standing enemy figures cannot occupy the same square, size
always wins; the larger of the two creatures displaces the smaller one. In
addition, the standing figure always chooses which square the displaced figure enters.
If the creatures are of the same size, an opposed Strength roll is made to
determine who stays and who is displaced.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I> Concluding our example, the halfling decides to rise again to avoid getting
trampled some more. Since the ogre is larger than the halfling, the halfling must
be displaced one square in order to rise. Since the ogre is also the standing
creature, it decides which square the halfling is displaced to. If the roles
had been reversed, with the halfling in the square of a prone ogre that wished to
stand, the halfling would still have to be displaced, since it is smaller.
However, this time the halfing, which is the standing figure, chooses which square
to be displaced to.

Of course, the standing figure might wish to keep the other figure from
rising, or the prone figure might decide to fight it out rather than try to rise. If
one figure wishes to keep another figure prone, an overbearing attack is
necessary, but treat the situation as if the attack roll to hit AC 10 is
automatically successful (see Overbearing, <A HREF="DD02689.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02689.htm">Chapter Five</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">).
