<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Globe of Serenity:</B> These glass orbs look very much like crystal balls. However, a <I>globe of serenity</I> emits a continuous, inaudible tone that affects all living creatures within
50 feet who fail a saving throw vs. spell. While in the area of effect, affected
creatures feel the utmost serenity and self-control. Strong emotions such as
joy, love, and hatred are totally subdued.
<P></P>
Creatures affected by the globe gain a +3 saving throw bonus to resist spells
and special attacks that affect emotions (such as <I>charm, fear</I>, or <I>emotion</I>). At the same time, they suffer a -2 to all Intelligence checks, the spark of
insight also repressed.
<P></P>
The globe also affects morale, raising the spirits of some while quelling the
fires of fanaticism in others. All affected creatures have morale of 10,
regardless of their training or skill. If a morale check is called for and failed,
the affected creature does not rout or flee, but stays in place, taking no action
until rallied.
<P></P>
<I>Globes of serenity</I> are best suited for lawful communities where open displays of emotion are
frowned upon. Although crime and violence would be greatly reduced in these
communities, citizens would also lack a sense of spirit. The people would go about
their daily routines like emotionless automatons.
