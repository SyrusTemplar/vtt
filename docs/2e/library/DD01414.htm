</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The male pronoun (he, him, his) is used exclusively throughout the second
edition of the AD&amp;D game rules. We hope this won't be construed by anyone to be an
attempt to exclude females from the game or imply their exclusion. Centuries of
use have neutered the male pronoun. In written material it is clear, concise,
and familiar. Nothing else is.
