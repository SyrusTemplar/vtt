<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Character Points</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Each race detailed below receives a number of character points that can be
spent on racial skills and other abilities. This lets players personalize their
characters. No longer must all dwarves have exactly the same abilities, skills,
and bonuses. Players can purchase packages of abilities, or they can customize
their characters.

Demihumans can save 5 character points from this process and apply them at any
other point in the character creation process. Humans can save 10 points.
Nonstandard races such as lizard men and thri-kreen cannot save any racial
character points?any points not spent on racial abilities are lost.

Numerous off-shoot races can be player characters. For example, a player fond
of dwarven characters could choose from the hill, mountain, gray, or deep
varieties. Players who select such a character purchase the standard package of
abilities for the subrace. Optionally, a player can customize a character by
choosing individual abilities from the list for that race. Generally, buying a
package of abilities is the most efficient way to spend character points.

for no additional cost in character points. However, no character can know
more languages than his or her Intelligence/Knowledge score allows (see<A HREF="DD02876.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02876.htm"> Table 9</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). If a racial package offers more languages than a character can know, the
player can choose which languages the character knows.
