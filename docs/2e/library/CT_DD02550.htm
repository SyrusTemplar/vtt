<P></P>
Here?s a tip for saving time: don?t make a battlefield bigger than it has to
be. There?s no point in mapping every street of a town if you?re confident that
you can contain the battle in one dark alleyway. Refer to the encounter ranges
listed for the various <A HREF="DD02534.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02534.htm">terrain types</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> in the previous section; you probably don?t need to make the battlefield
bigger than about 125% to 150% of the maximum encounter range. For example, in
light forest, the encounter range is 4d6 squares. The maximum encounter range is 24
squares, so you?ll want a battlefield about 30 to 35 squares across. If the
encounter is taking place indoors, it?s not necessary to map out more than the
room the PCs are fighting in.
