<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Pipes of Sounding:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">When played by a character proficient in music, these pipes can be used to
create a variety of sounds. To a listener the source of the sound will seem to be
anywhere within 60 feet of the piper. The possible sounds that can be created
are: wind blowing, laughter, whistling, bird calls, moaning, footsteps, crying,
mumbled voices, screams, running water, or creaking. (Note: The DM can rule
that other similar sounds are possible.)
