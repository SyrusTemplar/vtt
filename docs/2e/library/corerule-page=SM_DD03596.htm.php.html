Strike Location
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> In the movies, the hero always manages to get shot in the shoulder, the leg,
or just grazed in the side. Regrettably, adventurers aren’t always that lucky,
and even a fairly minor critical strike—say, a <I>magic missile</I>—could be extremely dangerous if it strikes the character in the eye or the
throat. The location of a critical strike is determined by rolling a d10 and
comparing it to <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03598.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03598.htm.php.html">Table 46</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> : Critical Strike Location.
<P></P>
For your convenience, the hit locations are numbered on each subtable in the
critical strike charts.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Called Shots: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">If a spell or special attack uses a normal attack roll, the attacker may
choose to use a called shot. A called shot forces the attacker to take a –4 penalty
on his attack roll, but if it hits and inflicts a critical strike, the strike
automatically affects the location the attacker was aiming for. Spells that do
not use attack rolls do not permit the caster to attempt a called shot.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Whole-Body Injuries: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Unlike most weapons, spells and special attacks create the possibility for
whole-body injuries which damage a creature in several places at the same time.
This is a function of the spell’s size or area of effect.

Huge creatures treat critical strikes as if they were one size smaller, so a
frost giant struck by a <I>fireball </I>would suffer 1d3 separate critical strikes, not 1d4. Gargantuan creatures
reduce the strike by two size categories. Regardless of the size of the strike, the
victim always suffers a critical strike in at least one hit location.

<I> Terthan, a human warrior, is struck by a </I>lightning bolt <I>and blows his save badly enough to qualify for a critical strike. The DM rules
that the bolt is a large attack (two to nine targets reasonably approximates a
lightning bolt’s area of effect) so Terthan will suffer 1d3 strikes. He rolls
a 2, or two separate hits, and refers to <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03598.htm.php.html"></A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03598.htm.php.html">Table 46</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I> . Naturally, Terthan is a humanoid; two 1d10 rolls result in a 5 (abdomen)
and an 8 (right arm). Now Terthan will go on to determine the strike’s severity
and see what kind of injuries he suffers.

Whole-body injuries can be ignored if the DM wishes; one roll on <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03598.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD03598.htm.php.html">the hit location table</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> should be enough for anybody. Whole-body injuries are a little more
“realistic,” and they make critical strikes much more deadly, but the game works fine
without them.
