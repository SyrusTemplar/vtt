<P></P>
Hags are witchlike beings that spread havoc and destruction, working their
magics, and slaying all whom they encounter.
<P></P>
Hags appear as wretched old women, with long, frayed hair and withered faces.
Horrid moles and warts dot their blotchy skin, their mouths are filled with
blackened teeth, and their breath is most foul. Though wrinkled and skinny, hags
possess supernatural strength and can easily crush smaller creatures, such as
goblins, with one hand. Similarly, though hags look decrepit, they run swiftly,
easily bounding over rocks or logs in their path. From the long, skinny fingers
of hags grow iron-like claws. Hags use these claws (and their supernatural
strength) to rend and tear at opponents in combat. Their garb is similar to that of
peasant women, but usually much more tattered and filthy.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The combat abilities of hags vary with each type (see below for details), but
all hags possess the following: 18/00 Strength or greater, some level of magic
resistance, and the spell-like ability to <I>change self</I> at will. Hags use this last ability to attract victims, frequently posing as
young human or demihuman females, helpless old women, or occasionally as orcs
or hobgoblins. A disguised hag reveals her true form and leaps to the attack
when weak opponents come near. Against well armed and armored parties, hags
maintain their disguise and employ further trickery designed to place the intended
victim in a more vulnerable position. This trickery can take any of several
forms, including verbal persuasion, leading the victim into a prearranged trap, and
so on.
<P></P>
The one weakness of hags is their arrogance. Hags have great disdain for the
mental abilities of all humans and demihumans and, though hags are masterful
employers of disguise, clever characters may be able to glean a hag's true nature
through conversation.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Hags live alone or in coveys of three. They always choose desolate,
out-of-the-way places in which to dwell. They sometimes coexist with ogres or evil
giants. The former act as servants or guards for hags, but giants are treated with
respect (for obvious reasons) and often cooperate with hags to accomplish acts of
great evil against the outside world.
<P></P>
While individually powerful, hags are much more dangerous when formed into a
covey. A covey is composed of three hags of any combination (e.g., two annis and
a green hag, three annis, etc.). Coveys have special powers that individual
hags don't possess. These powers include the following spells: <I>curse, polymorph other, animate dead, dream, control weather, veil, forcecage,
vision</I>, and <I>mind blank</I>. Covey spells can each be used once per day, and take effect as if they were
cast by a 9th-level spellcaster. To cast one of these spells, the members of
the covey must all be within 10 feet of each other and the spell being cast must
be in lieu of all other attacks.
<P></P>
Coveys never cast these spells in combat, instead these spells are used to
help weave wicked plots against neighboring human or demihuman settlements. A
common ploy by coveys is to force or trick a victim into performing some heinous
deed. This deed usually involves bringing back more victims, some of whom are
devoured by the hags; the rest are used on further evil assignments. Any creature
fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to resist a covey is immediately devoured.
<P></P>
A covey of hags is 80% likely to be guarded by a mixture of 1d8 <A HREF="DD04018.htm#70d32af6"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD04018.htm#70d32af6">ogres</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> and 1d4 evil giants. Coveys often use one or two of their ogres as spies,
sending them into the world beyond after polymorphing them into less threatening
creatures.
<P></P>
These minions frequently (60%) wear a special magical gem called a <I>hag eye</I>. A <I>hag eye</I> is made from the real eye of a covey's previous victim. It appears to the
casual observer to be no more than a low-value gem (20 gp or less), but if viewed
through a <I>gem of true seeing</I>, a disembodied eye can be seen trapped in the hag eye's interior. This hidden
eye is magically connected to the covey that created the <I>hag eye</I>. All three members of the covey can see whatever the <I>hag eye</I> is pointed at. <I>Hag eyes</I> are usually placed on a medallion or brooch worn by one of the hag's
polymorphed servants. Occasionally <I>hag eyes</I> are given as gifts to unsuspecting victims whom the hags want to monitor.
Destroying a <I>hag eye</I> inflicts 1d10 points of damage to each member of the covey that created it,
and one of the three hags is struck blind for 24 hours.
<P></P>
Hags commonly inhabit bone-strewn glens deep within forests. There is an 80%
chance that hags are keeping one or two captives in a nearby earthen pit or <I>forcecage</I>. These prisoners are held for a purpose known only to the hags themselves,
though it will certainly involve spreading chaos into the outside world.
Prisoners kept in a pit are guarded by an evil giant or one to two ogres; those in a
forcecage are left alone.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Hags have a ravenous appetite and are able to devour man-sized creatures in
just 10 rounds. They prefer human flesh, but settle for orc or demihuman when
necessary. This wanton destruction has earned hags some powerful enemies. Besides
humanity in general, both good giants and good dragons hunt hags, slaying them
whenever possible. Still, hags multiply rapidly by using their <I>change self</I> ability to appear as beautiful maidens to men they encounter alone. Hag
offspring are always female. Legends say that hags can change their unborn child for
that of a human female while she sleeps. They further state that any mother
who brings such a child to term is then slain by the hag-child she carries.
Fortunately, such ghastly tales have never been proven.
<P></P>
Hags hoard fine treasure, using the jewelry and coins to decorate the bones of
their more powerful victims, and the finer gems (500 gp value or higher) to
manufacture magical <I>hag eyes</I>.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Annis
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The largest and most powerful of all the hags, annis stand seven to eight feet
tall. Their skin is deep blue in complexion, while their hair, teeth, and
nails are glossy black. The eyes of an annis are dull green or yellow. Annis have
normal infravision (60-foot range), but superior hearing and sense of smell.
Annis are surprised only on a 1 on 1d10.
<P></P>
An annis attacks using its talons and teeth to inflict horrible wounds. In
melee, annis tend to close and grapple. An annis that hits an opponent with all
three of its attacks in one round has successfully grappled its opponent. Next
round, all attacks by the annis are automatic hits, unless the opponent is
stronger, the annis is slain, or the victim uses some magical means to escape the
hag. Otherwise, the annis will continue to hold the victim in its grasp, and
deliver damage with its raking talons and sharpened teeth each round until the
victim is slain.
<P></P>
In addition to normal attacks, annis have the ability to cast <I>fog cloud</I> three times per day. This spell is used to confuse resistance or to delay
attack by a superior foe. Annis can also <I>change self </I>like all hags, appearing as a tall human, ogre, or even a small giant. These
spells are cast at 8th level for purposes of determining spell range, duration,
etc.
<P></P>
The skin of an annis is iron-hard; thus edged weapons cause 1 less point of
damage when they hit these hags. Conversely, blunt weapons (including morning
stars) cause 1 additional point of damage against an annis.
<P></P>
Annis speak their own language, as well as ogre, all evil giant tongues, and
some common. Some of the most intelligent annis can speak common fluently and
know a smattering of various demihuman languages. Annis are believed to live for
500 years.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Greenhag
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">These wretched creatures live in desolate countryside and amid dense forests
and swamps. Greenhags, as their name implies, have a sickly green pallor. Hair
color ranges from near black to olive green, and their eyes are amber or orange.
Their skin appears withered but is hard and rough like the bark of a tree. Due
to their coloration and their ability to move with absolute silence, greenhags
impose a -5 penalty to an opponent's surprise roll when in a forest or swamp.
They have superior hearing, smell, and sight, including infravision (90-foot
range). They are only surprised on a roll of 1 on the 1d10 surprise roll.
<P></P>
Rock-hard talons grow from the long, slender fingers of greenhags. They use
these talons to slash and rend their opponents. Smaller than their annis cousins,
greenhags nonetheless possess Strength equivalent to that of an ogre (18/00).
Because of their great Strength, all their attack rolls gain a +3 bonus and all
hits receive a +6 damage bonus.
<P></P>
Greenhags can cast the following spells at will, one spell per round: <I>audible glamor, dancing lights, invisibility, pass without trace, change self,
speak with monsters, water breathing</I>, and <I>weakness</I>. Each spell is employed at 9th level of ability.
<P></P>
To lure victims, greenhags typically use their mimic ability. This enables
them to imitate the voice of a mature or immature male or female, human or
demihuman. Calls for help and crying are common deceptions employed by greenhags. They
are also able to mimic most animals.
<P></P>
Greenhags speak their own language (a dialect of annis) as well as all
demihuman languages and common. These are the longest lived of all hags -- they can
live for up to 1,000 years.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Sea Hag
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">These, the most wretched of all hags, inhabit thickly vegetated shallows in
warm seas and, very rarely, overgrown lakes. Warts, bony protrusions, and patches
of slimy green scales dot their sickly yellow skin. Their eyes are always red
with deep, black pupils. Long, seaweed-like hair hangs limply from their heads,
covering their withered bodies.
<P></P>
Sea hags hate beauty, attempting to destroy it wherever it is encountered. Sea
hags can <I>change self</I> at will, and often use this ability to draw their victims within 30 feet
before revealing themselves. The true appearance of a sea hag is so ghastly that
anyone viewing one of these hags grows weak from fright unless a successful
saving throw vs. spell is rolled. Beings that fail their saving throw lose ? of
their Strength for 1d6 turns. Worse still, sea hags can cast a deadly glance up to
three times a day. This look affects one creature of the sea hag's choosing
within 30 feet. To negate the effects of this glance, the victim must successfully
save vs. poison. If the saving throw is failed, the victim either dies
immediately from fright (25% chance) or falls stricken and is paralyzed for three days
(75% chance). Few who survive the glance live to tell of it, for sea hags
quickly devour their helpless victims.
<P></P>
Sea hags always use their deadly glance as their primary form of attack; they
will melee, but only if they have the advantage of numbers. Unlike other hags,
sea hags use daggers in combat, receiving a +3 bonus to their attack roll and a
+6 damage bonus, due to their ogre-like Strength.
<P></P>
Sea hags speak their own language as well as common and the languages of
annis, and sea elves, and live for 800 years.
