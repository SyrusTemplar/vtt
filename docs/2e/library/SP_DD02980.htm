<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Explorers</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Explorers live to see what?s over the next mountain or to sail beyond the
countries at the edge of a map. They yearn to discover new places, people, and
wonders. And their wanderlust drives them ever on. They make perfect adventurers,
never staying in one town for more than a few days or weeks. And they are
always eager to explore ruins, abandoned temples, and cave complexes. Many
explorers are demihumans who, not fitting into human-dominated towns, turned to
traveling. Others are half-breeds, such as half-elves, half-orcs, and half-ogres, who
found more acceptance in the wilderness than in either of their parent?s
communities. Of course, there are human explorers, too, these leaving their homes
simply because they had to know what?s out there.
