<A NAME="1be852a5"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>a. Charge Attack:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The creature is capable of making a charge attack, gaining a +2 bonus to
attack and inflicting double damage with an impaling weapon such as a spear,
javelin, or lance. Aarakocra perform a diving attack, centaurs charge like knights,
and bullywugs leap at their enemies.
<P></P>
<A NAME="093efffb"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>b. Move Silently:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The creature can <A HREF="DD02937.htm#9a9d502b"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02937.htm#9a9d502b">move silently</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, as the thief ability, with a base success of 40%, +5% per level.
<P></P>
<A NAME="0fa48144"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>c. Hide in natural settings:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The creature can hide in natural settings, just as a thief can <A HREF="DD02937.htm#8d71795b"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02937.htm#8d71795b">hide in shadows</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">. The base success chance is 35%, plus 5% per level. If a flat percentage
score appears next to this ability, use this score instead; for example, a satyr’s
abilities include c(90%), which means that a satyr has this ability with a 90%
success chance.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>d. Infravision:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The character possesses infravision (the ability to see in the dark) to a
range of 60 feet.
<P></P>
<A NAME="932aabea"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>e. Surprise opponents:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> When alone or with a group of similarly stealthy creatures, the character
gains a bonus on his chance to surprise his enemies. Bugbears inflict a –3 penalty
on opponents’ surprise checks. A bullywug using its chameleon power inflicts a
–2 penalty to opponent’s surprise checks, or a –6 if the bullywug attacks with
a leap from a place of concealment.
<P></P>
<A NAME="337d4854"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>f. Amphibious:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The character is at home in either water or air environments. Combat
penalties for fighting in water do not apply to the character, although using Type S or
B weapons underwater is still very difficult. Bullywugs are true amphibians
and can breathe water; lizard men are still air-breathers, but they can hold
their breath for a number of rounds equal to 2_3 their Constitution score before
checking for drowning.
<P></P>
<A NAME="f18a4cf4"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>g. Leap:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The character’s powerful leg muscles enable him to make astounding leaps,
bounding up to 30 feet forward or 10 feet into the air. Leaping to close with an
enemy is considered a charge attack, and the character suffers double damage if
he lands on a spear or similar weapon set against a charge. Bullywugs gain the
special ability to inflict double damage with a leap. Note that thri-kreen can
actually leap 50 feet forward or 20 feet in the air, but they do not gain this
ability until they reach 3rd level.
<P></P>
<A NAME="5c1e0058"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>h. Detect new construction:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The creature has natural skills for mining, and can spot new or unusual
construction with the percentage score noted. This is similar to the<A HREF="DD02893.htm#70006ec9"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02893.htm#70006ec9"> dwarven or gnome abilities</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> as described earlier in this chapter.
<P></P>
<A NAME="f1903858"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>i. Detect sloping passages:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The creature can note subtle grades or slopes in underground passageways and
chambers with the percentage score noted.
<P></P>
<A NAME="5fce362b"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>j. Detect sliding or shifting walls:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The creature can detect walls that move or shift with the percentage score
noted.
<P></P>
<A NAME="ef740248"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>k. Attacked last:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The character comes from a race notorious for its cowardice and
ineffectiveness in combat. Consequently, enemies are likely to dismiss the character as a
negligible threat and concentrate their attacks on other, more impressive,
members of the character’s party unless the character displays some unusual prowess,
powerful magic, or skill.
<P></P>
<A NAME="48337bf3"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>l. Hard to surprise:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The monstrous character’s keen senses make it very difficult to surprise him.
The character receives a +2 bonus to all surprise checks.
<P></P>
<A NAME="39615a4d"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>m. Tracking:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The character’s sense of smell is so acute that he can track, as per the
tracking proficiency, with a 50% chance of success. Normal modifiers for old or
confused trails may apply.
<P></P>
<A NAME="fae5d623"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>n. Spell immunity:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Minotaurs have the unique power of immunity to <I>maze</I> spells, due to their familiarity with labyrinths and other such places.
<P></P>
<A NAME="111ff584"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>o. Fearlessness:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Minotaurs also enjoy a +3 saving throw bonus versus fear, including <I>fear, scare, cause fear,</I> or <I>emotion</I> spells, dragon fear, and similar effects.
<P></P>
<A NAME="ccf11304"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>p. Sound mimicry:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Mongrelmen have the ability to perfectly imitate any sound they hear. They
cannot create magical effects such as a harpy’s song, a sphinx’s roar, or a <I>shout</I> spell by imitating these sounds, although they can duplicate the non-magical
aspects of these sounds exactly.
<P></P>
<A NAME="3fb7cf0b"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>q. Pick pockets:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Mongrelmen also have the ability to <A HREF="DD02937.htm#2c856baa"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02937.htm#2c856baa">pick pockets</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> as the thief ability, with a success chance of 70% plus 5% per level.
<P></P>
<A NAME="6c406283"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>r. Create magical pipes:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Satyrs can create pan pipes that can cast <I>charm, sleep</I>, or <I>cause fear</I> effects within a 60 foot radius. To gain this ability, the satyr must invest
4 character points in the music/instrument trait when first created, and then
devote 2 character points to the Music proficiency at least three times. He
can’t spend more than 2 character points per level on the proficiency, so the
earliest he can gain this ability is at 3rd level. The pipes themselves are easily
crafted and have no magical properties; it’s the satyr’s unearthly skill that
creates the magical effects.
<P></P>
<A NAME="5a104c2f"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>s. Magic resistance:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> The character is magic resistant. Giff have a flat 10% magic resistance,

githzerai has a magic resistance of 30%.

<A NAME="2c8f87fe"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>t. Antennae:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> A thri-kreen’s antennae give it a sensitivity to motion and serve to lessen
darkness-based combat penalties by 1 point while fighting enemies within 15 feet.
<P></P>
<A NAME="f96ad3cc"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>u. Paralyzing bite:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> At 5th level, a thri-kreen gains the ability to paralyze its prey with a
bite. The victim must save versus poison or be paralyzed 2–16 rounds (1–8 rounds if
larger than man-sized, or only 1 round if size H or larger.)
<P></P>
<A NAME="61bf5915"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>v. Dodge missiles:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> At 7th level, a thri-kreen gains the ability to dodge thrown or fired

<P></P>
<A NAME="56acc82e"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>w. Racial weapons:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> At 5th level, a thri-kreen automatically gains proficiency in the chatkcha, a
crystalline throwing wedge commonly used by the mantis warriors. At 7th level,
the character gains proficiency in the gythka, a thri-kreen polearm. Consider
these weapons to be equal to a javelin and a bill-guisarme respectively for
damage, range modifiers, etc.—but note that the chatkcha returns to its thrower if
it misses its target.

struck by +1 or better weapons, can fly at the listed rate, and have a magic
resistance of 2% per level. A swanmay’s equipment and belongings remain behind when
she transforms. The swanmay requires a magical token (a cloak, ring, or similar
item) to perform her transformation, and if she loses it she can no longer
transform until she gets it back.
