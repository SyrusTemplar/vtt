Another factor to consider when you create the personality of your thief is
race. Thieves are one of the two AD&amp;D? game classes that are open to any race
(the other is fighter), so there's a great deal of racial diversity among the
ranks.
<P></P>
Humans are assumed to be the norm throughout this book, but we'll include the
occasional note when special conditions or rules apply to nonhuman thieves.
<P></P>
Below, for instance, we have some observations on the behavior of thieves of
the various demihuman races. These suggestions are mere guidelines,
generalizations; it is by no means required that PC thieves should conform to these models.
PCs are exceptional in many ways, after all, not the least of which is
personality. These predispositions, as you might call them, may nonetheless be useful
as a starting point for conceptualizing your demihuman thief.
<P></P>
Reference is made below to the types of &quot;thief kits&quot; that the various races
are likely to take; thief kits are fully explained in Chapter 3, starting on p.
22.

<P></P>
Many dwarven thieves are not stealers, as such; but rather experts in
mechanical things, such as locks, traps and so on, that are used to thwart thieves. The
dwarven thief, then, is often an installer of such items, or an advisor on
security matters. And, naturally, knowledge of how to put something together is
also useful for taking it apart . . .
<P></P>
The kit most favored by dwarven thieves is, naturally, the troubleshooter.
Here he can make use of his knowledge and skills without engaging in the
dishonorable activity of genuine theft. If you want to check how secure your jewels
actually are, or whether your prison is in fact inescapable, a dwarven
troubleshooter is probably the best way to find out.
<P></P>
Bounty hunters also are found in the ranks of dwarven thieves. They may serve
the kings under the mountains, bringing back scoundrels and criminals who have
somehow escaped dwarven justice-and such characters are the only bounty hunters
permitted to be of lawful alignment. Other dwarven bounty hunters specialize
as repossessors. They use the full range of thieves' skills to recover stolen
items; and they are careful to take nothing else, thereby keeping their honor and
reputation impeccable.
<P></P>
It may be dangerous to call either of these sorts of dwarves a thief-a grave
insult in dwarven culture, in which tradition absolutely prohibits one dwarf
from stealing from another. Theft within a dwarven community is punishable by
banishment at the very least, and sometimes death.
<P></P>
The prohibition does not extend to stealing from other races, however
(especially goblins), but stealing is still less than honorable and a known thief is
usually viewed with caution and suspicion by his neighbors.
<P></P>
Dwarven thieves living outside the dwarven world either became tired of that
suspicion, or were expelled from their homes for theft or another transgression.
They still tend to retain a great deal of honor and the professional attitude
characteristic of their race; a former criminal may even have learned from his
crimes and youthful excesses, and could be a very reliable companion. A very
dangerous few, however, have abandoned their racial legacy, and become
treacherous and unpredictable.
<P></P>
Any dwarf found in a thieves' guild can be assumed to be an outcast from
dwarven society.

<P></P>
Elven thieves are sometimes characterized as eavesdroppers or spies. Elven
culture has shown relatively little interest in personal, material property; with
their incredibly long lifespans, they are more aware than most of the
transitory nature of things.
<P></P>
But while material things come and go, knowledge is eternal, and it is what
the elven thief covets above all. With their higher chances for finding secret
doors, and superior senses in general, elves are excellent at gathering
information. Of the various thief kits, they are most likely to become spies. An elf
raised in a larger human community might be inclined to take the investigator kit,
but this is a rare situation. The adventurer kit is also popular, especially
for the elven thief who wishes to traverse the world in search of exotic
knowledge. (Note that multi-class thieves cannot take a kit, however.)
<P></P>
Elves are careful with preparations; they can have patience that amazes other
races. They like to do research before a mission is undertaken, whether it be a
relatively simple burglary or a dive into a deep dungeon to track some
precious artifact.
<P></P>
Because of their heritage, elves are more likely than other thieves to
recognize the value of archaic or obscure items, such as books and artwork. (If you
are using the nonweapon proficiency system, you might let an elf check
information gathering or a similar proficiency to identify or estimate the value of such
an object.) An elf is also more likely to know where to fence the item-although
he would probably want to keep it for himself.
<P></P>
When elves do desire material goods, they are sure to be beautiful and
innovative ones. Elves take a special interest in items that are long-lasting and of
intellectual value (art, rare books, etc.).
<P></P>
Though enthralled by knowledge, elves are not overly secretive. They find
information exciting, and may delight in sharing it with their friends.
<P></P>
Finally, elves are dependable. You can usually expect an elf to behave as a
professional (though he might not be recognized as such) or a reliable guildsman
(though elves prefer to be independent of such organizations).

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
&quot;Prankster&quot; and &quot;thrillseeker&quot; are words that best describe the gnomish thief.
He takes delight in stealing, not out of greed but because it is like an
exciting game-a trial of puzzles and challenges, with a valuable prize if you
succeed. Thievery is recreation rather than a profession-but the reader knows well
how devoted and involved people can become with their games and recreation!
<P></P>
Gnomes are fond of burglary, though wall-climbing is difficult on account of
their small stature. They may be infallible &quot;box-men&quot; (experts at lock-opening
and trap-disarmament), having technical expertise comparable to dwarves', but
being more willing to put it to larcenous use.
<P></P>
Some have compared gnomish thieves to pack rats: Show one something shiny and
interesting, and he'll likely be so overcome by curiosity that he'll drop
everything in eagerness to discover a way to put the object of interest in his own
little paws.
<P></P>
Bulky treasures, such as coins or awkward items that must be fenced, are
avoided by gnomes. They are collectors, hobbyists who like to admire their trophies:
gems, jewelry and (perhaps favorite of all) fascinating magical devices.
<P></P>
Also, gnomes love to put their magic items to clever use. They delight more
than any other race in practical jokes. They may make themselves a nuisance to
fellow adventurers and thieving partners; but, though embarrassing or amusing,
such pranks are harmless. And at heart, a gnome, well-treated, is a most loyal
and reliable adventuring companion.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Half-elves live between two worlds-and perhaps this gives them a special
affinity for thievery, taking the best that both have to offer.
<P></P>
Some half-elves favor the world of one parent or the other, if raised and
accepted by that parent's society. But many more are wanderers, never quite feeling
at home or accepted in either society.
<P></P>
By seeing and understanding two diverse cultural viewpoints, half-elves are
acutely aware of peoples' differences in point of view-and how to capitalize on
those differences. This helps develop a well-honed ability to shade the truth
and, combined with the elven affinity for knowledge, makes half-elves excellent
swindlers. Targets are sometimes further impressed by a half-elf's exotic
appearance (pointed ears, lithe build, and so forth).
<P></P>
It is very easy, for instance, for a half-elf to enter a new town, find a
likely target, discover what that person needs or desires, and then appear at the
target's doorstep with a fake for sale. A half-elf swindler will milk a town or
area for however much it's worth, and move on when things get a little too hot.
Between towns he may link up with adventurers for protection (and perhaps con <I>them</I>, too), but eventually he'll move on when he has found new territory.
<P></P>
Many half-elves are loners and wanderers, which is not conducive to guild
affiliation. The ties of a half-elf thief to a guild are loose, at best, unless the
character has been raised in the guild structure and well-indoctrinated into
its mentality.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Sometimes portrayed as consummate burglars, halfling thieves are really
motivated by curiosity. The average halfling is content to lead a simple, safe,
comfortable life. But the thief longs to see and experience the world beyond the
hills and burrows of his home shire.
<P></P>
&quot;Adventurer&quot; is probably still too strong a word, for even halfling thieves
have their race's characteristic shy caution, plus a healthy dislike for danger,
discomfort, and uncertainty. Halflings make careful preparations whenever
possible, and use their skills of self-concealment liberally. Careful scouting is
always a must, and frontal assaults (whether in combat or robbery) anathema.
<P></P>
Many halflings have remarkably little interest in money, which can be
burdensome (especially for a small person). They'll take a good amount of loot,
certainly-at least enough for a pleasant period of ease and comfort before work is
made mandatory-but they are hardly motivated by greed.
<P></P>
Of great puzzlement to sages is the question: Where do halflings get their
extraordinary talent for thieves' skills? There is precious little locksmithing or
metalwork found in their culture, and thievery amongst the halflings
themselves is virtually unheard of-yet the halfling thief has an amazing knack for
almost all thieves' skills.
<P></P>
Coupling this knack and the attitudes just described, plus a fierce loyalty
for their friends, the halfling thief is understandably in high demand for
adventuring expeditions.
