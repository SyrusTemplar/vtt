In most civilizations, priests are supposed to act as counselors to everyone
in need of advice. (This is one reason that Wisdom is a prime requisite.)
<P></P>
Therefore, the priest character should not be surprised when he finds NPCs
seeking him out and consulting him on troubling moral and ethical problems. These
are good role-playing opportunities; they are often leads to specific
adventures; and, with especially knotty problems, they can be difficult puzzles for the
players to solve, all without using their swords and maces.
<P></P>
Often, priests are posted to specific noble leaders in order to be their
personal advisors. Naturally, this is only done when those noble leaders desire it,
are willing to allow it, or (because of the priesthood's political strength)
cannot afford to refuse it. This is a way to establish some sort of bond between
new player-characters: The priest player-character could be assigned as advisor
to the noble player-character.
