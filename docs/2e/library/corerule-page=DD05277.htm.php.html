is deducted from the character's hit points normally.
<P></P>
Every normal blow struck (that is, every blow not declared as aimed at a
specific Body Location) hits the character's torso (i.e., any point from his
shoulders to his hips).
<P></P>
However, if you take a Called Shot, you can make your strike at any one of six
other Body Locations (head, two arms, two legs, and stun-points).
