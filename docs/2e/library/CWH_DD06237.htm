Notice that a wizard's chance of successfully researching a spell could exceed
100 percent, particularly when a high-level wizard is researching an existing
low-level spell. Although automatic success is certainly in the spirit of the
game (according to Table 4 of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>, all wizards of 19th level and above have a 100 percent chance of learning
new spells), some DMs might prefer to eliminate any chance of automatic success.
If so, we suggest requiring that all wizards must roll for success, even if
their calculated chance exceeds 100 percent; a roll of 95 or higher is treated as
failure.
