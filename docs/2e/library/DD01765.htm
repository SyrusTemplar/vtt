</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B> </B>Whenever a player character takes on a hireling, follower, or henchman, he has
committed himself to certain obligations and customs that surround such
agreements. Some of these are obvious, having been worked out between the player
character and the NPC in advance. Usually the wage and term of service are settled
upon before any agreement is reached. For hirelings and followers, this is a
set amount of money each day, week, or month, or a fee for a specific task.
Henchmen commonly receive a portion (half a normal share) of all treasure and magic
found on adventures. A player character is normally expected to contribute a
little more from his own funds, however.

Other obligations of the player character are varied. Some must always be
considered, while others almost never come into effect. A player character is
expected to provide meals and boarding (unless the NPC has a home nearby). This is
the most common obligation and applies to NPCs of all walks of life. For those
engaged in more dangerous pursuits, however, additional concessions must be
granted. Since horses are expensive, player characters should be ready to cover the
cost of mounts lost in combat or on campaign. It is unreasonable to expect a
mercenary to buy a new mount from his meager savings. Likewise, other items of
war craft--weapons and armor--must be replaced by the player character. All
soldiers are expected to provide their own equipment when they are first employed,
but the player character must replace all losses. Certainly all player
characters are expected to pay the cost of special transport--securing passage on ships
and arranging wagons for baggage. Of the grimmer duties, player characters are
expected to pay for a decent (though hardly lavish) interment.

One of the more unusual obligations of a player character is to ransom his
men. This is especially true of men lost during a campaign. The greater number of
soldiers lost in a battle are not slain but captured. Common practice of the
medieval period was to officially ransom these prisoners for well-established
prices. A common yeoman footman might ransom for 2 gp, a minor priest for 80 gp, a
knight's squire for 200 gp, and a king's man for 500 gp. These are paid for by
the lord of the prisoner. A player character (as a lord and master) is
expected to do the same. Of course, the player character can pass much of this cost on
to his own subjects and the relatives of the prisoner. Thus men might languish
for long periods in the hands of the enemy before their ransom was raised.
Furthermore, should a player character ransom a hireling, follower, or henchman,
he has every reason to expect loyal service from that man in the future. After
all, he has demonstrated his willingness to save that NPC from hardship and
death.

In a fantasy world, a player character is also expected to bear the cost of
magical spells cast to the benefit of his men. He may arrange to have his men
blessed before battle or healed after it. He shouldn't grumble about the expense,
because the spells also make good tactical sense. The <I>bless</I> spell increases the success of his army in the field. Magical cures get his
army back on its feet quicker. All these things can make him very successful
while also making him popular with his hired men.
<P></P>
Finally, the player character is expected to make an effort to raise or
restore slain henchmen. This is not a normal expectation of hirelings or followers
(although it can happen in extreme cases). The effort should be honest and true.
A player character shouldn't fool himself into thinking no one will notice if
he doesn't do his utmost. The player character who returns from an adventure
minus his henchman is automatically under a cloud of suspicion, despite his most
vehement protests. A player character must take great care to maintain his
reputation as a good and upright employer.
