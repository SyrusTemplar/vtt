The forest druid--<A HREF="PHB_DD01489.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01489.htm">the druid described in the PH</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">--serves as the guardian of both the great forests of the wilderness and the
smaller woodlands and orchards that lie next to cultivated fields in flat lands,
rolling plains, or wooded hills. Forest druids hold trees (especially ash and
oak) sacred and never destroy woodlands or crops, no matter what the situation
(although a druid could act to change the <I>nature</I> of a wood enchanted with evil, for instance, without destroying it). The
forest druid acts as a living bridge between the wilderness and those humans--such
as hunters, loggers and trappers--who dwell on its borders.
<P></P>
As the player, you can choose to role-play one of two kinds of forest druids:
one from a temperate deciduous forest, or one from a subarctic conifer forest.
The former type is better known and more numerous on most worlds; though
conifer forests grow to vast sizes, they exist within often hostile environments and
lack the great variety in wildlife of warmer forests.
<P></P>
For quick reference, the information on the temperate-forest druid branch is
repeated here, along with suggested proficiencies. Unless otherwise noted,
information applies to both temperate- and cold-forest druids.

<B>Granted Powers:</B> The forest druid has the following granted powers:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Receives a +2 bonus to all saving throws vs. fire or electrical attacks.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Learns the languages of woodland creatures (centaurs, dryads, elves, satyrs,
gnomes, dragons, giants, lizard men, manticores, nixies, pixies, sprites,
treants, etc.), gaining one extra proficiency slot for this purpose every three
levels (at 3rd, 6th, etc.). (The languages of cold-forest druids include those of
the giant lynx, giant owl, pine treants, and cold-dwelling groups of centaurs,
elves, gnolls, gnomes, etc.)
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Identifies plants, animals, and pure water with perfect accuracy at 3rd level.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Passes through overgrown areas at 3rd level without leaving a trail and at
full movement rate. For instance, the temperate-forest druid Garon (pictured
above) can move with ease through dense thorn bushes, briar patches, pine trees,
tangled jungle vines, and so on. He also is immune to poison ivy, poison oak, and
similar irritating plants. When using this power, Garon must be on foot, not
riding an animal.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Has immunity to <I>charm</I> spells cast by woodland creatures such as dryads at 7th level. The druid's
immunity does not extend to <I>charm</I> spells cast by creatures who merely happen to be living in or passing through
a forest, such as a woods-dwelling human mage or vampire.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Shapechanges into a normal, real-world reptile, bird, or mammal up to three
times per day at 7th level, exactly <A HREF="PHB_DD01493.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01493.htm">as described in the PH</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. Each animal form (reptile, bird, or mammal) can be used only once per day.
The druid cannot assume giant forms.
<P></P>
Special Limitation: See &quot;Holy Symbol and Grove.&quot;
<P></P>
<B>Holy Symbol and Grove:</B> The grove of a forest druid is just that: a stand of hallowed trees. Druids
of this branch--such as Gatha, a cold-forest druid (illustrated on p. 15)--use
mistletoe as a holy symbol. For full effectiveness, Gatha must gather the
mistletoe by the light of the full moon using a golden or silver sickle specially
made for this task. If a spell requires a holy symbol and Gatha only has mistletoe
harvested by other means, halve the damage and area of effect (if any) and add
+2 to the target's saving throw (if applicable).
