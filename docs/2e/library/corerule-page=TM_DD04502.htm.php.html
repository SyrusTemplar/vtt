<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Pick of Earth Parting:</B> This enchanted pick allows its wielder to cut through elemental earth
quickly. The wielder of the pick must have strength of 17 or better. By repeatedly
swinging the pick at elemental earth, the wielder can carve out a 10'x 10'x 60'
tunnel per round. The pick's magical properties create a smooth, clean surface
regardless of the mining skill of the user. All rubble from the excavation
magically disappears, leaving a clear passage.
