The level can be determined by comparing the spell to already existing ones.
<P></P>
If the spell inflicts damage, its level should be within one or two of the
number of dice of damage it causes--thus a spell which inflicts 5d6 points of
damage should be about 3rd to 5th level.
<P></P>
If the spell is an improvement of an existing spell, it should be at least two
levels greater than that spell. If the spell is one of the other group (a
priest researching a wizard's spell), it always should be at a higher level than it
is in its natural group. Quite often it will also be less effective than the
spell that inspired it.
