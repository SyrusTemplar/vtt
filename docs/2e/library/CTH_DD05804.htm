Following are several types of thieves represented by thief kits. Before
allowing his players to choose kits for their characters, the DM should review each
kit and make notes for himself about them.
<P></P>
For each thief kit, the DM must determine:
<P></P>
<P></P>
1. If he will even allow this kit in his campaign.
<P></P>
<P></P>
2. What additional information he needs to give the players about each kit.
<P></P>
<P></P>
3. What changes he might wish to make to each kit.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Let's take the Beggar kit as an example. In most fantasy campaigns this kit
would be acceptable, at least in concept; although it is not inconceivable that
one state might be so benign as to provide for all its needyâ€”or so harsh as to
keep them off the streets forcibly.
<P></P>
Assuming the DM says that yes, the Beggar kit will exist in his campaign, he
needs to decide which details are specific to the Beggars of his world. What
causes people to be Beggars? In a predominantly lawful evil society, for example,
there may be a class of people that is systematically oppressed. (This sort of
society, by the way, is a perfect setting for thief player characters, whose
campaign goal can be to overthrow the oppressive system.) The DM should inform
the players of all these details specific to his campaign.
<P></P>
Finally, after the DM has decided on all the details, he should go back
through the thief kits as they are presented here and adjust them as he sees fit.
