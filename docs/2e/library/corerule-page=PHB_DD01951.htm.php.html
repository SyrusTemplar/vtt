</B> This spell is similar to the <I>invisibility</I> spell, but the recipient is able to attack, either by missile discharge,
melee combat, or spellcasting, and remain unseen. Note, however, that telltale
traces (such as a shimmering effect) sometimes allow an observant opponent to
attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when
specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made his presence known).
Attacks against the invisible character suffer -4 penalties to the attack rolls,
and the invisible character's saving throws are made with a +4 bonus. Beings
with high Hit Dice that might normally notice invisible opponents will notice a
creature under this spell as if they had 2 fewer Hit Dice (they roll saving
throws vs. spell; success indicates they spot the character).
