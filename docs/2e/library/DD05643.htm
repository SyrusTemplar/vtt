This ceremony is often a part of the Confirmation of Birth event: The child is
given his name before witnesses. In some cultures, though, the child might be
given a use-name when he is born, and won't be given his true name (or will
choose his true name) years later, when he is old enough to understand its
significance. It may be that in this culture the character's true name is supposed to
be kept a secret, and the child tells it only to one priest, so that the god
might know it.
