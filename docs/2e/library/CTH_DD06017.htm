<I> The old rogue slurped his ale noisily, complaining to the bartender, &quot;The
thieves these days, they've lost the art of it all. Like a bloody bunch of bandit
half-orcs: Their idea of an elegant theft is a rich victim bashed neatly on the
head, so his fancy clothes don't get scuffed so much and can be fenced more
dear.&quot; The young bartender raised his eyebrows, a little wary but curious about
what the wizened old coot had to say. &quot;Now, in my day, the thief we all looked
up to was one whose only weapons were his wits and a steady, speedy hand. It
would be hours before his victim even knew'd he was robbed, and then he couldn't
be sure who done it.

&quot;There was this one guy, Willie-Cool Willie, they called him, 'cause he never
lost his cool. He know'd ALL the scams . . . &quot;

Since day one, there have been people eager to get a free ride, to swindle
others out of anything they can. These people, it has been observed, are typically
the best targets for the swindler. After all, how likely are you to report a
con man, when the reason he succeeded was that you thought you were taking
advantage of him? Playing off other peoples' greed is the key to a successful
swindling career, on whatever scale it is performed.
<P></P>
An astute swindler is always on the lookout for opportunities for a good
racket. Some of these situations and scams have been nearly immortalized, and are
classics: Not only does it seem everyone knows them, but everyone still uses
them-and they still work. An excellent book filled with real-life anecdotes of
classic cons is <I>The Compleat Swindler</I>, by Ralph Hancock with Henry Chafetz (New York: Macmillan, 1968).

What follows is a sampling of scams for the novice pigeon plucker.
