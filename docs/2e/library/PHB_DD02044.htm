This spell creates a <I>spectral force</I> spell that activates upon command or when a specific condition occurs. The
illusion has visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements. It can be of any
object, creature, or force, as long as it remains within the boundaries of the
spell's area of effect.
<P></P>
The occurrence that begins the illusion can be as general or as specific and
detailed as desired, such as the following: ?Begin only when a venerable female
human carrying a sack of groat clusters sits cross-legged within one foot of
this spot.? Such visual triggers can react to a character using the <I>disguise</I> ability. Command range is 5 yards per level of the wizard, so a 12th-level
wizard can command the programmed illusion to occur at a maximum encounter range
of 60 yards. A programmed illusion cannot distinguish invisible creatures, nor
alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class, except by external garb. If desired, the
effect can be keyed to a specific noise or spoken word. The spell lasts until
the illusion occurs; thus, the spell duration is variable. The illusion will
last for a maximum of one round per level of the spellcaster.
<P></P>
Creatures that attempt to disbelieve the illusion gain a saving throw vs.
spell and, if successful, see it for what it is and add +4 bonuses to associates'
saving throws, if this knowledge can be communicated effectively. Creatures not
sensing the spell effect are immune until they become aware of it. The illusion
is subject to a <I>dispel magic</I> spell.
<P></P>
The material component of the spell is a bit of fleece.
