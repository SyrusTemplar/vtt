<P></P>
This spell changes the characteristics of a square region of terrain. The area
can be no more than 120 yards on a side. The priest can effectively turn a
flat plain into a slope of any direction, or may flatten an existing slope. The
spell does not allow the priest to alter the pull of gravity, however.
<P></P>
This spell lets the priest create or negate a height differential of as much
as 20 feet (a 2&quot; slope in BATTLE SYSTEMâ„¢ rules measurements) within the area of
effect. This can have various consequences; the best way to discuss the effects
is by example.
<P></P>
<B>Example 1: </B>Two units face each other on a flat plain. The priest can alter the slope of
the terrain so that one unit is 2&quot; of elevation higher than the other. The unit
that is upslope gains the combat benefits for higher ground, and the unit that
is downslope must pay the movement cost for moving uphill if it wishes to
approach the other unit.
<P></P>
<B>Example 2:</B> One unit is on flat terrain; another unit, 6&quot; away, is on a hill of 2&quot;
elevation. Using this spell, the priest can effectively eliminate this difference in
elevation (raising the low ground or lowering the high ground). All combat and
movement involving these two units is then conducted as if there were no
elevation difference (i.e., no movement penalty, no combat benefit for higher ground,
etc.). Alternatively, the priest could increase the height differential by 2&quot;.
Combat and movement would now be conducted as if the total difference in
elevation were 4&quot;.
<P></P>
<B>Example 3:</B> A unit faces a hill of 3&quot; elevation. The priest casts <I>gravity variation</I>, decreasing the effective elevation of the hill to 1&quot;. The unit pays a lower
movement point cost to climb the hill. Alternatively, if the unit facing the
hill were an enemy unit, the priest could increase the effective elevation to 5&quot;.
<P></P>
The priest must specify the degree and direction of change at the moment of
casting. These parameters cannot be changed while the spell remains in effect.
<P></P>
<I>Gravity variation</I> can have dramatic effects on siege engines and towers. Most siege engines can
be moved only on the most gentle of slopes. By raising or lowering the
effective elevation of siege engines by 2&quot;, the priest can totally immobilize them by
positioning them on a slope too steep to negotiate. In the case of siege
towers, there is a 50% chance that the structures will topple over (totally
destroying them).
<P></P>
The material component is a tiny plumb bob; the plumb line must be made of
platinum wire while the bob itself must be a gem of at least 1,000 gp value. The
device is consumed in the casting.
