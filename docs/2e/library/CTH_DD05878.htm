In some cases there may be an unusual reason why thieves are strongly opposed
to (or allied with) an adventuring guild (including temples, etc.) in a city.
The most notable example is a cordial alliance with clerics of a deity favoring
thieves (e.g., Erevan Ilesere for half-elven and elven thieves, or Olidamarra,
in Oerth; or Mask in Faerun). If some particular type of multi-class thief is
common in a city for some reason, then there will obviously tend to be a
stronger link between the two relevant guilds than usual. For example, if mage-thieves
are common, then the Guild of Wizardry will take a definite interest in the
activities of thieves. Under such conditions, the mages will probably not attract
unwanted attention from light-fingered thieves (although few sane thieves try
stealing from mages anyway).

But other possibilities exist. Consider a burgeoning frontier town, which is
close to wild hills and forests with bountiful resources. Furs, gold from
prospectors, meat from hunted animals, even some gems from a small mine; all these
and more pour into the town, which grows rich and attracts many new settlers.
Unfortunately, it attracts humanoids and bandits (as external threats) and many
thugs and foreign cut-throats and evil thieves (as opposed to the neutral-aligned
indigenous thieves). The rulers of the town grow fearful . . .
<P></P>
A twin alliance springs up to defend the town by stealth and cunning. Rangers
patrol the distant countryside to give advance warning of marauding humanoids
or bandits. Within the city, the thieves use their skills to tip off the
powers-that-be about unsavory types arriving from outside, conspiring robbers and
thugs, and the like (and may deal with a few of them themselves). Bandits beyond
the town have spies inside it; the thieves tip the rangers off about this, and
pass on intercepted messages. The thieves trade a magical shield (which they
cannot use) they got from one of the thugs they dealt with to the rangers (who can
use it). The rangers hand over a magical shortsword they took from a hobgoblin
leader in return. Half-elven thieves and rangers share a drink together in an
elven tavern, sharing the latest dwarf jokes. The two groups then save money by
a joint bulk purchase of leather armor, and so it goes on . . .

Having an unusual, unexpected alliance like this spices up any adventure
locale. It's well worth a DM's time to devise such a backdrop, to make a town or
city unusual and particularly memorable.
