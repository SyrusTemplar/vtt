<B>Description:</B> This character is the heroic scofflaw, the warrior who defies the laws and
rulers of the land and steers his own course. Usually in the company of other
pirates or outlaws, he fights the minions of the rulers he defies, and comes to be
regarded as a hero by others who suffer at those rulers' hands. The Pirate, of
course, is the adventurer of the high seas, who makes his living raiding other
ships and seacoast communities; the Outlaw makes his home in the wilderness
(often deep forest) and preys on the traffic moving through that wilderness.
<P></P>
There are no special ability-score requirements to be a Pirate or Outlaw.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> In a campaign, the pirate or outlaw can belong to one of two orientations.
Either he's a &quot;good guy,&quot; and it is the law and the rulers who are evil, or he is
a &quot;bad guy&quot; and simply takes what he wants from those who have it. The player,
therefore, gets to decide on his character's alignment and (mis)deeds.
<P></P>
Note, though, that good guy pirates and outlaws tend to live by a very strict
code of conduct?for example, the classic cinema code of Robin Hood and his
Merry Men, where the outlaws robbed from the rich and gave to the poor, and
protected the defenseless with more honor and zeal than England's supposedly Noble
Warriors did.
<P></P>
Naturally, if a player chooses to be a good guy in a company of bad guys, or
vice-versa, when his companions find out his true colors, they'll probably try
to kill him or to turn him in to the law for the reward on his head.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> If the character is a Pirate, roll d100 for his Secondary Skill. On a 01?70,
his Secondary Skill is Sailor; on a 71?80, it's Shipwright; on 81?00, it's
Navigator. If the character is an Outlaw, the character may choose between
Bowyer/Fletcher, Forester, Hunter, and Trapper/Furrier.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> If the character is a Pirate, he must take the following proficiencies:
Cutlass*, and Belaying Pin* or Gaff/Hook* (player choice). If the character is an
Outlaw, he can take any weapon proficiencies he chooses . . . but the DM, if he's
created this campaign so that the outlaws have a special motif weapon (such as
Robin Hood's Merry Men and their longbows) may insist that all Outlaw
characters take a specific weapon proficiency. Recommended to classic Merry Man-type
outlaws are longbow, long sword and quarterstaff. (The ``*'' symbol indicates a
new weapon found in the <I>Equipment</I> chapter.)
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Pirate's Bonus Proficiencies: (General) Rope Use, Seamanship. Pirate's
Recommended Proficiencies: (General) Swimming, Weather Sense, (Warrior) Navigation,
(Priest, double slots unless Paladin) Engineering (for shipbuilding),
Reading/Writing (for mapmaking), (Rogue, double slots) Appraising, Set Snares (in
association with Rope Use skill), Tightrope Walking, Tumbling, (Wizard, double slots
unless Ranger) Engineering (for shipbuilding), Reading/Writing (for mapmaking).
Outlaw's Bonus Proficiencies: Direction Sense, Fire-Building. Outlaw's
Recommended Proficiencies: (General) Riding (Land-Based), (Warrior) Animal Lore,
Bowyer/Fletcher, Endurance, Hunting, Running, Set Snares, Survival, Tracking,
(Priest, double slots unless Paladin) Healing, Herbalism, Local History, (Rogue,
double slots) Disguise. <I>Special Note</I>: Your DM may be a fan of the very acrobatic pirate or outlaw movies of the
past, and prefer that Tumbling be one of your Bonus Proficiencies instead of one
of the ones listed; check with him to see if this is so.
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> Pirates and Outlaws come from widely diverse backgrounds, so there's no real
restriction on what they can buy with their starting money. However, it would
be foolish for either type of character to buy metal armor of any kind (banded,
brigandine, bronze plate, chain, field plate, full plate, plate mail, and ring
mail). Pirates wearing such armor in naval combat will inevitably fall
overboard and sink (they can't swim with such stuff on); if they're lucky enough to get
it off so they <I>can</I> swim, they've lost the armor. Outlaws living out in the wild have their
belongings exposed to the elements, and metal armor quickly corrodes. Therefore,
it's up to the DM to keep things in balance. If a Pirate or Outlaw buys metal
armor and keeps it stowed away for special occasions (major land engagements,
climactic battles, etc.), that's fine. But if they wear such stuff all the time, the
DM should continually take it away from them through accidents, rust and
corrosion, etc.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> Pirates and Outlaws do not have any intrinsic special benefits, although the
DM can bestow some campaign-based benefits on them if he chooses. For instance,
in many Pirate settings, there is a powerful pirate city where the PCs can go
to trade their ill-gotten gains, a place where the law dares not enter; this
makes it easier for them to dispose of their goods and enjoy the benefits of a
home city when otherwise they wouldn't have one. As another example, in a &quot;Merry
Men&quot; type outlaw campaign, the heroes have the dubious benefit of knowing that
they're on the right side and if they can just oust the current rulers
(probably restoring the proper rulers in the process), they'll have their fortunes
restored or enhanced, the land will once again be bright and shiny, and everyone
will live happily ever after.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> The major problem with being an outlaw or pirate is that the law is always
after the characters. Though the authorities do not have to put in an appearance
in every single play-session, they're always out there, plotting against the
heroes. Many of them are quite clever, they probably have more money, ships and
men than the heroes, and they'll continue to plague the heroes until the
campaign is done.
<P></P>
<B>Wealth Options: </B>Pirate and Outlaw characters get the standard 5d4x10 gp for starting gold.
<P></P>
<B>Races:</B> Outlaws and Pirates, unless your campaign is very human-oriented, will take
just about anyone they can get, so it's perfectly appropriate for there to be
Outlaws and Pirates of the demihuman races.
<P></P>
<B>Note:</B> In a Pirate campaign, it could be that the player-characters will eventually
come to terms with the authorities and &quot;go straight.&quot; This doesn't mean they
have to abandon the Pirate Warrior Kit, however. They could instead become
Privateers?who are basically pirates sailing under the papers of (permission of)
their ruler, and preying on the nation's enemies. At that point, they can still
behave just as they did previously, and the other nation's authorities become
their specific enemy.
