</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Three times per day, a necromancer can exude a mystical, poisonous radiance
that taints nearby food or drink. Two types of food corruption are possible: one
that induces a comatose slumber (available to wizards of any level), or another
that brings a slow and excruciating death (granted to necromancers of 13th
level or higher). In both cases, the food corruption requires a physical act of
will on the part of the necromancer; it is not a continuously operating aura. The
victims of both types of corruption are allowed a saving throw vs. poison.
<P></P>
The first, sleep-inducing type of corruption is difficult to detect in food or
drink and has an onset time of only one round. This form of corruption can be
created in food simply by the necromancer being within 30 feet of the food. The
sleep lasts for up to one turn per level, but is automatically broken by any
attempt to physically harm the slumbering individual.
<P></P>
The latter, deadly type of corruption results in a faint physical discoloring
or putrefaction of the food. There is a 5% chance per level of the victim that
the food?s taint will be noticed before it has been consumed. Once tasted,
however, the symptoms become quickly apparent. Severe stomach cramps begin in a few
minutes, and an agonizing death results in another 2?12 rounds. This
corruption can only be created in openly displayed food (such as a buffet table, an
uncovered plate or a stand in a market) within 1?3 feet of the necromancer.
<P></P>
Food corrupted in this manner radiates a faint necromantic aura. The symptoms
in a victim can be arrested or completely reversed by <I>slow poison, neutralize poison, heal</I>, or possibly by a character proficient in the healing nonweapon proficiency.
Food can be cleansed of the corruption either by casting <I>purify food and drink</I> or <I>dispel magic</I>.
