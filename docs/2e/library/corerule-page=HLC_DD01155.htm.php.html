Make sure the opponent acts as smart as it should. Any foe worthy enough to
challenge high-level PCs didn’t get that way through foolish actions. This does
not mean that only foes with genius-level intelligence are suitable in
high-level play. Even opponents with low intelligence can learn from experience and are
not necessarily foolish. A man-eating tiger, for example, has an Intelligence
rating of 2–4, but its experience in stalking people can make it a canny and
unpredictable opponent for any group. An opponent doesn’t have to be brilliant to
challenge high-level characters: It has to avoid obvious mistakes.

Many DMs tend to think of very weak creatures, such as goblins and kobolds, as
prone to foolish and unintelligent behavior; this is an error. Kobolds and
some goblins have average Intelligence, which make them as smart as a typical
human. Humans are pretty inventive creatures. They have survived an ice age and
have produced and maintained our incredibly complex and technical culture.
Creatures with average intelligence might blunder when making split-second decisions,
but they learn from their mistakes and prepare for the worst. For a more
complete discussion of how intelligence affects a creature’s actions in combat, see
