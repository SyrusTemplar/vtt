Whether an NPC is able to disbelieve a PC wizard's illusion or whether a PC is
able to disbelieve an NPC illusion is ultimately up to the DM. The DM should
allow a saving throw against an illusion if the subject has any reason at all to
doubt the existence of what he is experiencing. To account for the degree of
realism in a given illusion, as well as any information available to the subject
about the perceived illusion, the DM should modify the subject's saving throws
with appropriate bonuses and penalties.
<P></P>
How does a DM make these decisions? There are a number of factors that can be
considered to help determine bonuses and penalties for saving throws. It's
unrealistic to expect the DM to meticulously evaluate every aspect of an illusion
before he decides on the modifiers, but the following can be used as general
guidelines
