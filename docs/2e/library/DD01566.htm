<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fishing:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The character is skilled in the art of fishing, be it with hook and line, net,
or spear. Each hour the character spends fishing, roll a proficiency check. If
the roll is failed, no fish are caught that hour. Otherwise, a hook and line
or a spear will land fish equal to the difference between the die roll and the
character's Wisdom score. A net will catch three times this amount.
<P></P>
Of course, no fish can be caught where no fish are found. On the other hand,
some areas teem with fish, such as a river or pool during spawning season. The
DM may modify the results according to the situation.
