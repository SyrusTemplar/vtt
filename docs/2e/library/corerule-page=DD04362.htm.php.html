This spell prevents most types of undead creatures from entering the area of
effect (a cube whose sides equal the caster's level times 5 feet--a 15th-level
caster could affect a cube whose sides equal 75 feet).
<P></P>
When an undead creature attempts to enter the protected area, the creature is
affected by the ward as if it were being turned by a priest two levels lower
than the caster. The casting priest need not have the ability to turn undead
himself. Thus, an <I>undead ward</I> created by a 10th-level priest would turn creatures as if by an 8th-level
priest.
<P></P>
The results of the turning attempt are calculated normally. If a large number
of undead assault the warded area, not all of them are turned by the spell,
since the normal limitations apply. Undead who are unaffected by the turning
attempt ignore the <I>undead ward</I> for its duration. Undead within the area of effect when the spell is cast are
not affected. However, when such undead leave the area of effect, they are
subject to the effects of the spell if they attempt to reenter.
<P></P>
The material component is the priest's holy symbol, which must be carried
around the perimeter of the area to be warded.
