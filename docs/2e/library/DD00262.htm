During play, pay attention to the actions of the player characters.
Occasionally compare these against the characters' alignments. Note instances in which
the character acted against the principles of his alignment. Watch for tendencies
to drift toward another, specific alignment.
<P></P>
If a character's class requires that he adhere to a specific alignment,
caution him when a proposed action seems contrary to that alignment. Allow the player
to reconsider.
<P></P>
Never tell a player that his character cannot do something because of his
alignment. Player characters are controlled by the players. The DM intervenes only
in rare cases (when the character is controlled by a spell or magical item, for
example).
<P></P>
Finally as in all points of disagreement with your players, listen to their
arguments when your understanding of an alignment differs from theirs. Even
though you go to great effort in preparing your game, the campaign world is not
yours alone--it also belongs to your players.
