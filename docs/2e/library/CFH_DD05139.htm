<P></P>
<B>Description:</B> The Beast-Rider is a warrior in a tribe or clan (usually a barbarian tribe)
which has a strong affinity for one type of animal. The animal is the totem of
the tribe, and the Beast-Rider makes friends very easily with that type of
animal and can train it into a riding-beast. . . even if it's a type of animal not
normally considered a riding-beast.
<P></P>
In a campaign, the Beast-Rider is an exotic warrior who is notable for his
kinship with his animal; like the Barbarian, he brings a wild, outsider's attitude
into the adventuring party. His animal also has abilities which can benefit
the adventuring party. However, the more unusual the animal is, the harder it is
to accommodate in all situations: It's no problem to stable a horse at the inn,
but just try stabling a great white wolf, a wild boar, or a dolphin!
<P></P>
To be a Beast-Rider, the character must have a Charisma of at least 13.
(Naturally, there are members of the Beast-Rider's tribe who are not themselves
Beast-Riders; the Beast-Riders are the tribe's elite warriors.)
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> As mentioned, in his own society, the Beast-Rider is the elite warrior, and
he commands a lot of respect among his own kind. Outside his tribal grounds,
however, he's very definitely an outsider. His barbarian mannerisms and his
obvious and very unusual friendship with his animal set him apart from most
societies. Because of this, the Beast-Rider may become especially attached to the other
player-characters (if they treat him as an equal and not a freak), even if he'd
never admit it to them.
<P></P>
The DM needs to reinforce this social role by having NPCs react to the
Beast-Rider's strangeness. For instance, NPCs will be leery of speaking to or
negotiating with the Beast-Rider if there's a more &quot;civilized&quot; character on hand to
perform those functions. The DM needs constantly to use the Beast-Rider's reaction
modifiers, listed below under &quot;hindrances.&quot;
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> If you're using the Secondary Skills rules, the character must take the Groom
(Animal Handling) secondary skill.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Required: None. Recommended: All the weapons commonly associated with mounted
warriors—Bow (composite short, and short), Horseman's flail, Horseman's mace,
Horseman's pick, Lance (any, according to the size of the animal), Spear,
Bastard Sword, Long Sword.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Bonus Proficiencies: Animal Training, Riding (Land-based). The character must
declare which one sort of animal both these proficiencies pertain to.
Recommended: General—Animal Handling, Direction Sense, Fire-building, (Priest) Healing
(specifically veterinary), (Warrior) Animal Lore, Hunting, Mountaineering, Set
Snares, Survival, Tracking.
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> When he is first created, the Beast-Rider may only have Hide, Leather, or
Padded armor (plus shield and helm). Later in the campaign, he may switch to more
advanced forms of armor. . . as long as his mount can carry him and the armor
both, of course. When first created, he may have only weapons from the list
above under &quot;Weapon Proficiencies.&quot; (The DM may change or add to this list to
reflect specific cultural details of the Beast-Rider's tribe.)
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> The Beast-Rider has an amazing rapport with one type of animal. The animal
must be of a species normally strong enough to carry the Beast-Rider and act as a
mount. With the DM's permission, the Beast-Rider character gets to decide what
sort of animal this is; the DM is encouraged to disallow any sort of animal
that will give the Beast-Rider a great advantage in the campaign (for example, a
pegasus or griffon).
<P></P>
The Beast-Rider gets a +5 positive reaction adjustment whenever dealing with
these animals. He finds it easy to make friends with them; on a die-roll result
of 9 or less (on the &quot;Hostile&quot; column of the Encounter Reactions Table, <I>Dungeon Master's Guide </I>page 103), he can even persuade attacking animals of this sort to leave him
and his allies alone.
<P></P>
Additionally, the Beast-Rider begins play in the campaign with one of these
animals as his personal friend and mount. This animal is devoted to him and will
risk (or even sacrifice) its own life to save the character; and the character
is expected to behave the same way toward his mount. (If he doesn't role-play
this attachment to his animal, the DM should decide that the character has
abandoned this Warrior Kit, as per the guidelines given later in this chapter.)
<P></P>
The Beast-Rider has a telepathic rapport with his animal. When in contact or
visual line of sight with his animal, he can tell what the beast is feeling,
even thinking if it has some intelligence; he and the animal can communicate with
one another without appearing to. When the two are not within line of sight
with one another, each will know the other's emotional state and whether or not
the other is hurt; each will know the direction to travel to find his friend, and
the approximate distance (a hundred yards, an hour's travel, several days'
travel, for instance).
<P></P>
If the animal ever dies, the Beast-Rider can choose another animal of the same
type as his companion. However, the DM must include this situation as part of
the campaign story: The character must seek out another such animal, and may
only be satisfied with the healthiest, strongest, greatest examples of this
animal (in other words, if the character appears to be content to settle with less,
the DM tells him, &quot;You sense you won't be able to bond with this animal . . .
&quot;); then there must be some sort of bonding ritual between beast and man (for
example, a physical combat where the human must be able to saddle and ride the
animal in spite of its spirited attempts to throw him). Only then can the
character have his new animal.
<P></P>
Following is a list of many animals which are appropriate mounts for the
Beast-Rider. Note that not all of them are included in the <I>Monstrous Compendium®</I> series; if a player chooses one not included there, and the DM approves the
choice, the DM will have to work up the animal's abilities.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Bat, Huge *+ (mobat) (gnomes and halflings only may ride)
<P></P>
Bear
<P></P>
Boar
<P></P>
Buffalo
<P></P>
Camel
<P></P>
Dolphin &amp;
<P></P>
Dragon *+ (only allowable in very high-powered heroic campaigns) Elephant
<P></P>
Griffon *
<P></P>
Hippogriff *
<P></P>
Horse
<P></P>
Hyaenodon
<P></P>
Lizard (Fire, Giant, or Minotaur)
<P></P>
Lobster, Giant &amp;
<P></P>
Pegasus *
<P></P>
Ray, Manta &amp;
<P></P>
Sea-Horse, Giant&amp;
<P></P>
Smilodon
<P></P>
Tiger, Wild
<P></P>
Unicorn (traditionally, only virgin lawful-good females may ride)
<P></P>
Wolf, Dire (evil characters could bond with a Winter Wolf)
<P></P>
<P></P>
* Flying animals do tend to change the nature of a campaign, especially a
low-level campaign, by making it easy for characters to go long distances quickly,
to avoid difficult terrain, etc. The DM should disallow any such choice if
it will cause problems in his campaign.
<P></P>
<P></P>
+ Since many of these creatures are evil, the DM may have to introduce into
his campaign a nearly-identical race with neutral or good tendencies.
<P></P>
<P></P>
&amp; This species only works if most of the campaign takes place in watery
domains.
<P></P>
<P></P>
To calculate the weight-bearing abilities of these animals, compare them to
the <A HREF="PHB_DD01641.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01641.htm">list on page 78 of the Player's Handbood</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">. Choose the animal from that list most resembling your animal in size and
mass, and then use the values for that animal.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances: </B>As mentioned earlier, the Beast-Rider is out of place in most societies. He
takes a –3 negative reaction adjustment when meeting NPCs from any culture but
his own. (The player-characters do not have to be hostile to the Beast-Rider if
they do not wish, however.)
<P></P>
Also, should the Beast-Rider's animal ever die, whether it's in the
Beast-Rider's presence or far away, the Beast-Rider immediately takes 2d6 points of
damage and must make a saving throw vs. spells. If he fails the saving throw, he
behaves as if he were a magic-user hit with <I>feeblemind</I> for the next 2d6 hours. Even if he makes the saving throw, the player should
role-play the character's reactions—he's just felt, through their telepathic
link, the death of his beloved friend, after all.
<P></P>
<B>Wealth Options:</B> The Beast-Rider gets the ordinary 5d4x10 gp for starting gold. Like the
Barbarian, however, he must spend it all (before starting play) except 3 gp or less.
<P></P>
<B>Races: </B>This is a kit that is especially appropriate for demihuman characters. It's
easy to envision dwarves on boars, elves on dire wolves, sea-elves on giant
sea-horses, and so on.
<P></P>
<B>Notes:</B> It adds a lot of detail and color to a campaign if the DM does a certain
amount of work creating the society of each Beast-Rider tribe. The tribe's behavior
and activities would be dictated by the type of animal it was tied to:
Horse-Riders would live on the plains, riding far and wide, while Boar-Riders would
live in forests and moist bottom-land, few ever travelling more than five miles
from their home village.
