<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Throwing grapples is by no means the most efficient
way of attaching a rope to a wall, battlement or similar structure.
Greater range is ensured by the use of arrows, and many special
arrowheads have been developed to help the thief's chances with such operations.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Two distinct methods are used with special function
arrows. The first is known as the one-rope method. The rope is simply
affixed to the arrow, and when the arrow has found its mark the thief
merely climbs directly up the rope. This method is simple, but the
rope attached must be strong enough to bear the thief's weight, and
this considerably reduces the effective range of the bow (and incurs
penalties of -2 to hit and damage rolls if the arrow is used in
combat for any reason). It also means that the bow shot, being less
accurate and powerful, is less likely to provide a good purchase on
the target.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The second method is the two-rope method. Here, a
light string is threaded through a loop attached to the arrow, and
both ends of the string are kept by the thief. The string is light
enough not to affect the flight of the arrow. When the arrow has
struck the target, a stout rope is attached to one end of the string
and the string pulled through to play out the rope, thread it through
the loop, and extend it fully in place of the string. This method is
obviously more time consuming than the one-rope method; it takes one
round to play out 20 feet of rope in this manner. Twice the length of
rope is needed, of course, since the rope goes from the thief to the
target and back. this method is more likely to obtain a firm fixing
of the arrow into the target.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Either of these two methods can be used with any of
the special function arrows below, with the single exception stated.
Table 30 gives rules for their usage.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Wood Biter:</B> This has a broad, flat head with
backward-facing barbs. It is specifically designed to give a good
grip when shot into wooden surfaces.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Stone Biter:</B> The stone biter has a narrow,
heavy head of metal, with small ridges rather than barbs. Careful
craftsmanship is needed to produce these arrows, with high-quality
metal being used and the arrow sharpened to the greatest possible
extent. It is designed to give a grip when shot into stone, but will
only work on relatively soft stone such as sandstone or brick.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Stone Biter (Adamantine):</B> This is as the above
arrow, save that adamantine is used in its manufacture. This makes
the arrow capable of biting into all but the hardest stone surfaces,
but also makes it <B>extremely expensive.</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Minor</B> <B>Grapple:</B> This has a small,
three-pointed grappling hook as its head, perhaps some 3 inches in
total width. This is usually shot through a window, over a palisade,
etc., in much the same way as a conventional grappling iron is thrown.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Major Grapple:</B> The major grapple is a far more
complex piece of apparatus than the minor grapple, and because of its
method of use it can only be employed with the one-rope method (see
above). The head of this arrow at first appears to be a fairly long
arrowhead of normal width. Its true function is shown only when
fired. The rope must be securely fixed at one end by the thief, and
as the major grapple arrow closes in on its target and reaches as far
as the rope will allow, the sudden tension pulls at the head of the
arrow, which opens out into a large three-pointed grappling hook.
This is some 6 to 8 inches in width, fully the equal of most ordinary
grappling irons. The major grapple has better aerodynamics than the
minor grapple and a better chance of gripping, but a considerably
reduced range.</FONT></P>

made when using a special function arrow.</FONT></P>
