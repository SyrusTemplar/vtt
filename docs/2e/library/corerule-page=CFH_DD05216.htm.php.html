<P></P>
This is the classic technique of using a one-handed weapon and carrying a
shield on the other arm.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Advantages
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The principal advantage of Weapon and Shield Style is that you get the AC
bonus of a shield; this is especially good when you can find a magical shield which
confers a better AC bonus.
<P></P>
A second advantage is that the character can use the Shield-Rush maneuver
(below, under &quot;Melee Maneuvers&quot;).

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The disadvantage to Weapon and Shield Style is that the left arm (right arm,
for left-handed characters) is dedicated to the shield and is not much use for
anything else. If the character is disarmed, all he has to wield offensively is
his shield, until he can get back to his weapon. If he is pinned in combat, he
can't use his shield hand for grappling.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Style Specialization
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
If you devote a weapon proficiency slot to specialization in Weapon and Shield
Style, you receive one extra attack per round . . . only when using a shield
on the shield-hand, that is. You can use that extra attack <I>only</I> for the Shield-Punch and Parry maneuvers (see under &quot;Melee Maneuvers,&quot; below).
<P></P>
As with the normal &quot;Attacking with Two Weapons&quot; rules (see the Player’s
Handbook, <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01697.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01697.htm.php.html">page 96</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">), when striking with both hands in a single combat round, the character
suffers a –2 to attack rolls with his weapon and a –4 to attack rolls with the
Shield-Punch or Parry. (If you're ambidextrous, as described above under &quot;Off-Hand
Weapons Use,&quot; that's a –2 with weapon and –2 with shield.) If you devote a <I>second </I>weapon proficiency slot to Weapon and Shield Style Specialization, that
penalty drops to with the weapon and –2 with the shield. (If you're ambidextrous,
that penalty is 0 with weapon and 0 with shield.)
<P></P>
On any round when you perform two maneuvers, you do not get the AC bonus for
the shield for the rest of the round. If you swing your sword and perform a
Shield-Punch in the same round, you do <I>not</I> get your shield's AC bonus if anyone attacks you later in the round.
