<I>Description: </I>The Adventurer is the jack-of-all-trades, the prototypical dungeon-delving
thief. The Adventurer is not so much a thief as a character who takes advantage of
the general thiefly skills on professional adventures into dungeon and
wilderness. The Adventurer thief kit has no requirements beyond those of the thief
class itself.
<P></P>
<I> Role:</I> Adventurer-kit thieves usually serve in parties of brave adventurers of
various classes. Their special skills are vital in supporting any successful
expedition into wilderness or dungeon. The professional Adventurer is, furthermore,
preferred by many adventuring parties, because he is much less likely than other
thieves to betray or steal from his own companions. The successful Adventurer
knows the value of trust and cooperation, while many a &quot;street thief&quot; has been
raised on duplicity and (sometimes literal) backstabbing.
<P></P>
Many Adventurers are neutral or lawful. Few are evil, and almost none that are
chaotic evil can survive for long, let alone prosper in his ways.
<P></P>
Adventurers may be part of a thieves' guild for easy access to equipment and
training. They tend to be independent, however, and dislike guilds that have
demands beyond a simple membership fee.
<P></P>
<I>Secondary Skills:</I> Any.
<P></P>
<I>Weapon Proficiencies:</I> Any.
<P></P>
<I>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</I> Required: None. Recommended: Player's choice; among those that may be
selected are Alertness, Boating, Fast-talking, Gather Intelligence, and Looting.
<P></P>
<I>Skill Progression</I>: Adventurer thieves tend to spread their skill improvements as evenly as
possible, to allow them to deal with the many different challenges the adventuring
life presents. If there is any concentration, it is usually on opening locks or
finding and removing traps, since these skills are probably used most often.
<P></P>
<I>Equipment:</I> Adventurers are typically very gadget-oriented, delighting in new ways to
bypass monsters and raid their lairs. They also may have a good bit of money, from
successful ventures, to reinvest in equipment.
<P></P>
<I>Special Benefits:</I> None.
<P></P>
<I>Special Hindrances:</I> None.
<P></P>
