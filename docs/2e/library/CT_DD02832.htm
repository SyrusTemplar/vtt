</B>Animals are creatures with four limbs of some kind and sometimes a tail. They
employ natural weaponry and usually walk on four legs, fly, or swim. An
animal’s size has no effect on its type.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Avian</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The creature has two forelimbs adapted for flying (sometimes for swimming) and
two hind limbs for walking or roosting: birds, bats, rocs, and perytons are
examples of avian type creatures.
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits: </B>Use the animal charts; treat foreleg hits as wing hits.
<P></P>
<B>Combat: </B>Avians tend to swoop to the attack, then break away, just as humanoid flyers
do. Avians attacking from a dive are considered to be charging and inflict
double damage with their claws.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Quadruped
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This is the most common animal type; examples range from house cats to
elephants.
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits: </B>Use the animal charts. If the animal has no tail, reroll any tail hit.
<P></P>
<B>Combat: </B>Large quadrupeds frequently charge and overrun their opponents. Smaller
quadrupeds prefer to attack from surprise.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Serpent</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The creature has a head and a long, legless body. Snakes, nagas, and eels are
examples of serpent type creatures.
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits: </B>Use the animal chart; most leg hits are treated as tail hits.
<P></P>
<B>Combat: </B>Many serpents can employ a constriction attack. Treat constriction attacks as
wrestling attacks, except that there is no attack of opportunity and the attack
must hit the opponent’s normal Armor Class. A creature trapped in the
serpent’s coils is considered grappled and locked (see <A HREF="DD02685.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02685.htm">Chapter Five</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">) and can use the normal wrestling procedure to get free.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fish/Whale
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The creature has a long, streamlined body with flippers or fins for direction
control.
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits: </B>Use the animal charts. Foreleg hits (location rolls of 1 or 2) can affect
pectoral fins or flippers. Rolls of 3–5 affect the tail. Movement penalties from
fin or flipper hits apply only if the animal changes direction or makes a melee
attack during the round. The animal relies on its tail for movement and suffers
movement penalties from tail criticals with severities of 9 or more.
<P></P>
<B>Combat: </B>These creatures often employ avian tactics, using their superior swimming
speed to deliver quick attacks and then move out of reach.
