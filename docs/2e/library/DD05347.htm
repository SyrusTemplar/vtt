<P></P>
If a character chooses to wear no head protection at all, he suffers no Vision
or Hearing check penalties.
<P></P>
However, the character has one hindrance, if you're using the optional hit
location rules from the <I>Combat Rules</I> chapter.
<P></P>
If a character is wearing no head protection, an attacker can make a Called
Shot against his head and thereby ignore the character's AC benefits from armor.
(All bonuses from shields, high Dexterity scores, and magical items still
count, however.) Since this is a very difficult shot (a total ?8 to attack rolls,
remember), this doesn't do the attacker much good, unless the victim is otherwise
heavily armored.
<P></P>
<I>Example: Halway the archer has two possible targets, Territor and Bosque, two
brutal guards. Territor is wearing leather armor and no headgear; this puts him
at AC 8, and with his Dexterity bonus he's AC 6. Bosque is wearing full plate
+2, no headgear, and body shield; this puts him at AC ?2.
<P></P>
Halway, after all modifiers for range, his Dexterity, and other factors, is
THAC0 16. (He's a 6th-level warrior, with a Dexterity of 16, and is firing at
Medium Range.)
<P></P>
If he shoots at Territor, AC 6, he needs only a (16?6) 10 or better to hit
him. If he shoots at Territor's unprotected head, the shot becomes much harder;
he's shooting at AC 8 (AC 10, ?2 for Territor's Dexterity), and so would normlly
need a (16?8) 8; but with the ?8 to attack rolls for a head shot, he's back to
a roll of 16 or better. It's easier for him to hit Territor with a normal,
non-specific shot.
<P></P>
If he shoots at Bosque, AC ?2, he needs to roll an (16?{?2}) 18 or better to
hit him. If he shoots at Bosque's unprotected head, the shot becomes somewhat
easier; he's shooting at AC 9 (AC 10, modified by Bosque's shield), and so would
normally need a (16?9) 7; with the ?8 to attack rolls for a head shot, he's up
to a roll of 15 or better. This makes it slightly easier to hit Bosque, and may
give him the special effects of the head location shot if he succeeds, so
that's the shot he attempts.
<P></P>
</I> The lower (better) a target's AC is, the better an option it is to try a head
shot, <I>if his head is unprotected and the rest of his body is armored</I>. Characters interested in this option should calculate the math of both shots
and compare the results, if they know all the relative ACs and modifiers; if
they don't, they should ask the DM, in general terms, if it's even worth their
time to try such a shot.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>The Cap</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
The Cap is a padded, leather or even steel skullcap which is about the size of
and worn much like a close-fitting cap, beret or hat. It gives the wearer no
penalty for Vision Checks, and a ?1 penalty with Hearing Checks (as it partially
covers the ears). It's often worn in conjunction with padded, leather, hide,
studded leather, and other lightweight armors.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>The Coif
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The Coif is a padded chain mail hood; it fits fairly snugly around the neck
and over all the head except the face from chin to forehead. Like the Cap, it
gives the wearer no penalty for Vision Checks and only a ?1 penalty with Hearing
Checks. It's usually worn with chain mail.
<P></P>
Often, a heavily-armored knight will wear a chain mail coif and wear a Great
Helm <I>over </I>it. The only benefit this confers is that such a knight can remove his Great
Helm, the better to see and hear around him, and still have some head
protection. As a disadvantage, it adds a little weight to the knight's equipment, but it
does not decrease his Vision and Hearing checks any further than just wearing
the Great Helm.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>The Open-Face Helmet
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The Open-Faced Helmet, made of reinforced leather, or of metal, covers the
back, sides and top of the face, leaving most of the face open. It gives the
wearer a ?1 penalty with Vision Checks, and a ?2 penalty with Hearing Checks (it
completely covers the ears, usually with small holes or grating over the ears so
that the wearer can hear at all).
<P></P>
Examples include the Corinthian helmets of ancient Greece. In a medieval
campaign, open-faced helmets are often worn by military officers and soldiers who
can afford the protection.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>The Closed-Face Helmet
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The Closed-Face Helmet is made of metal and is much like the Open-Faced Helmet
. . . except that there is armor plate, often in the form of a visor which may
be opened, in front of the face. It gives the wearer a ?2 penalty with Vision
Checks, and a ?3 penalty with Hearing Checks.
<P></P>
Examples include the basinet mentioned in the <I>Player's Handbook</I>, the galea and myrrmillo mentioned for the gladiators (above), and many other
combat helmets. Many knights and other mounted warriors wear helmets of this
type.
<P></P>
If the wearer of a Closed-Face Helmet is also wearing plate mail or field
plate armor, he gets a +1 to saving throws vs. dragon breath, and to spells such
as<I> burning hands, pyrotechnics, fire ball, flaming sphere, wall of fire, delayed
blast fireball, incendiary cloud</I>, and <I>meteor swarm</I>, and other fire-based spells and magical effects (as determined by the DM).
<P></P>
If someone uses a Lasso, Chain, or Bolas in an effort to snare a rider's head,
and that rider is wearing a Closed-Face Helmet, the victim gets to roll 1d6.
On a 4?6, the attack is handled normally, but on a 1?3, the attack is treated
just as a normal lasso or chain dismount; the attacker doesn't do the extra
damage that the head-lasso attack normally allows.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>The Great Helm</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
The Great Helm is a massive helm which covers the entire head, from the top of
the head to the top of the shoulders, leaving slits open for the eyes and
holes open for breathing; it has no removable visor. It gives the wearer a ?3
penalty with Vision Checks, and a ?4 penalty with Hearing Checks.
<P></P>
The Great Helm provides the following other benefits:
<P></P>
The wearer of a Great Helm gets a +2 saving throw vs. wizard spells such as<I> hypnotism, light</I> cast on his eyes, <I>blindness, hypnotic pattern, suggestion, fire charm, rainbow pattern</I>, and some other mind-controlling spells . . . but not <I>charm person, charm monster,</I> or <I>domination.
<P></P>
</I> If the wearer of a Great Helm is also wearing plate mail or field plate armor,
he gets a +2 to saving throws vs. dragon breath, and to spells such as <I>burning hands, pyrotechnics, fire ball, flaming sphere, wall of fire, delayed
blast fireball, incendiary cloud</I>, and <I>meteor swarm,</I> and other fire-based spells and magical effects (as determined by the DM).
If, instead of plate mail or field plate, he is wearing full plate, the bonus is
a +3 to saving throws.
<P></P>
If someone uses a Lasso, Chain, or Bolas in an effort to snare a rider's head,
and that rider is wearing a Great Helm, the attack is automatically treated
just as a normal attack. With lasso or chain, it's a normal lasso or chain
dismount, and the attacker doesn't do the extra damage that the head-lasso attack
normally allows. With Bolas, the attack does normal damage, but no strangulation
damage.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
If you use these rules in a campaign, you add some color and distinction
between the types of armor that your PCs will be wearing. On the other hand, once
again, it's an added level of complexity which the game doesn't have to have. Use
these rules only if the added complexity doesn't bother you, and if the
special functions of the different types of helmets appeal to you.
