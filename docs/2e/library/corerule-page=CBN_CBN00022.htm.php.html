</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Undead Master specializes in the creation of undying minions and the
summoning of extraplanar allies. Above all, this necromancer craves power over
others, reveling in the thrill of commanding obedient servants. The mindless undead,
as unthinking and ever-faithful automatons, make perfect and unquestioning
slaves that will shoulder even the most loathsome burdens without hesitation. The
Undead Master enjoys dominating the feeble will of the living, subverting the
dead, and controlling the fiendishly powerful.
<P></P>
Examples of this kit can be found in a few of Clark Ashton Smith’s stories.
The necromancer Malygris from “The Last Incantation” and “The Death of Malygris”
and the vengeful Namirrha from “The Dark Eidolon” make ideal models for this
kit. Also, the DM might check out Glen Cook’s <I>Black Company</I> series, which involves a necromancer known as the Dark Lady, who subjugates
her living apprentices, creating the infamous Ten Who Were Taken.
<P></P>
<B>Requirements:</B> Members of this kit may be of any non-good alignment.
<P></P>
<B>Spell Preferences:</B> First and foremost, these wizards are avid practitioners of necromancy that
creates, augments, or controls undead. At higher levels, these wizards
eventually turn to powerful spells from the Conjuration/Summoning school that call upon
extraplanar creatures.
<P></P>
Unlike most necromancers, <I>the Undead Master has access to the school of Enchantment/Charm</I>, enabling this specialist to dominate the minds of the living as well as the
dead.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> The Undead Master is a variant of the Archetypal Necromancer and, as such,
makes a dangerous villain for the campaign. However, unlike the Archetype, who
tends to be a solitary menace, the Master is always surrounded by a host of
undead servants, summoned fiends, bound genies, and charmed monsters. These wizards
are never encountered without</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="1"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">a large entourage of minions, making members of this kit especially terrible
foes in combat.
<P></P>
The Undead Master may be encountered both in the wilderness and in the midst
of society. In the abandoned hinterlands, many Masters establish petty domains
where they can rule over legions of undead with impunity. Eventually, the most
powerful Masters gravitate back to human society, where they attempt to impose
their will over the living. Sometimes, they magically establish a tower in the
center of a city, replete with their most powerful guardians. The presence of an
Undead Master in a city directly challenges the authority of the local
aristocracy, who will seek to remove the wizard, regardless of the cost (providing a
good opportunity for adventurers). Of course, the Master is always well prepared
for such “welcoming parties.”
<P></P>
Sarzec the Broken (the author of the letter at the beginning of this chapter)
is an example of a low-level Undead Master for the campaign. Along with his
associate Pizentios, he illustrates how a group of allied necromancers can band
together with deadly results. This necromancer is featured again in the
introductory anecdotes for Chapters Seven and Eight, and his detailed character sheet
has been included in Chapter Nine. Despite his low level, his alliance with his
former mentor Pizentios makes him an extremely dangerous adversary.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> The Master may choose only <I>one</I> of the regular weapons available to the wizard (namely the dagger, dart,
staff, sling, or knife). At higher levels, additional weapon slots must be invested
in nonweapon proficiencies. A wizard like Sarzec almost never enters into
melee personally, as he relies on his minions for protection in battle.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies: </B>Required: necrology, netherworld knowledge. Recommended: (General) etiquette,
heraldry; (Wizard) ancient history, astrology, languages (ancient),
reading/writing, religion, spellcraft, spirit lore. Forbidden: all Priest, Rogue, and
Warrior.
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> Although the Undead Master is typically outfitted like any wizard, this kind
of character tends to be vain, so he or she usually only obtains possessions of
the highest quality. Indeed, powerful Undead Masters may consider themselves
to be on par with royalty (no matter how humble their birth). A low-level wizard
like Sarzec relishes a position of authority such as commanding a ship of
undead as a captain. These attitudes are clearly reflected in their choice of dress
and accouterments.
<P></P>
Once they reach a sufficiently high level, Undead Masters devote considerable
attention to properly outfitting their numerous followers, from the lowliest
skeleton to the most powerful fiend. Only the uncouth Archetype will send
skeletons into battle with their bony claws as weapons. Masters care not only about
the combat potential (weapons) of their servants, but about their physical
appearance as well. Sometimes, the equipment of an archmage’s servants will approach
the extravagance and quality of a royal guard.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> All Masters are able to command undead creatures, exactly as if they were
priests of the same level. Their ability to command undead also extends to fiends
and extraplanar creatures, which are treated as undead with the same hit dice
(without considering any hit point modifiers). This special benefit results from
the wizard’s complete mastery of the baneful rites and conjurations that
control or bind not only the cold undead, but also the sinister inhabitants of the
netherworld. For example, Sarzec, a 6th-level Master, can command undead and up
to 6-HD extraplanar creatures, exactly like a 6th- level priest.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> In return for knowledge of Necromancy, Conjuration/Summoning, and
Enchantment/Charm, the Undead Master neglects study in other schools of magic. The Master
is restricted from casting spells which are exclusively taught in the schools
of Alteration, Illusion, and Major Divination. This significantly reduces the
wizard’s repertoire of spells when compared with other necromancers (gaining the
Enchantment/Charm school is more than offset by the loss of Alteration and
Major Divination).
<P></P>
The Master may also not use specialized, wizardly items that draw exclusively
from these restricted schools of magic, including wizard scrolls of any
restricted spells, <I>wands of illusion or polymorphing, robes of eyes, scintillating colors</I>, or<I> repetition</I> (TOM), <I>crystal balls, amulets of far-reaching, extension</I>, or <I>meta-spell influence</I> (TOM), <I>medallions of spell exchange</I> (TOM),<I> talismans of memorization</I> (TOM), <I>Nefradina’s identifier</I> (TOM), or <I>Tenser’s portmanteau of frugality</I> (TOM). However, magical items which are available to all classes (such as a <I>potion of polymorphing</I>), that operate without specialized knowledge of the restricted schools, can
be employed.
<P></P>
Finally, the greatest hindrance of this kit is the wizard’s own self-centered
personality, which often borders on madness. Undead Masters tend to be
megalomaniacs of the highest degree. They always consider themselves, their
experiences, their feelings, and their quests for power above those of others. They demand
to be the center of attention, ruthlessly subverting (or even eliminating)
those who contest their supremacy. The Undead Masters’ overwhelming need to be in
complete control of every situation and to dominate everyone around them
results in their most obvious weakness. Anyone who can successfully stand up to them
will shatter their composure and possibly provoke an irrational or
poorly-conceived response, even when it runs contrary to the wizard’s established,
long-term interests. Finally, the DM should feel free to impose any additional
penalties from Chapter Three, to more distinctively round out the Undead Master’s
twisted character.
