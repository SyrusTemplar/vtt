Our DM is scripting the thieves' guild for the large town (or small city) of
Mallain. The DM knows some basic social facts about this place, having placed it
on the map in his campaign world, and records these facts for future
reference. The issue of weak rulership is something the DM had decided in advance,
likewise the fact that Mallain is in a civilized area of the country, and on a major
inland trade route. The DM determines the population at somewhere around
17,000 (not too large, not too small!) and decides that 5% are halflings and 5% are
half-elves; there are no full elves, and a smattering of dwarves and gnomes.
The DM considers that there is a slight tendency toward lawfulness in the
community, but not a strong one, so the overall social alignment is recorded as
neutral.
<P></P>
How wealthy is Mallain? The DM rolls a 7 on Table 7. To this is added +2,
because the town is on a major trade route. The DM adds a further +2, since Mallain
is a large town, if not a major one. This gives an adjusted total of 11, so
the wealth level is average.
<P></P>
The attitude of the law is resolved on Table 8, and a dice roll of 17
indicates tolerance. Why? One clear reason sticks out a mile: under-manning. The DM has
already recorded that the ruler of the land is weak, and his militia is small
in this safe, secure land. There simply isn't the manpower to go around chasing
the thieves.
<P></P>
The attitude of merchants is resolved on Table 9. A roll of 14, modified to 15
by the tolerance of the law, indicates a complex/mix. The DM isn't sure enough
of how to script a complexity here; he isn't clear enough in his own mind
about the details of Mallain. So he opts for a mix, and makes two more dice rolls
on the same table to see what the mix is (adding +1 to each roll for the
tolerance of the law). He rolls 12 (13, with a +1), which indicates a standoff; his
second roll is 1, and even with a +1 modifier this indicates warfare! How to
synthesize this into a whole? The DM reasons that most merchants are described by a
standoff—they put up with the thieves in a fairly resigned way. A minority,
though, are furious about thieving for some reason; maybe they have suffered
particularly heavy losses. This place isn't rich, after all. They try hard to
persuade the ineffectual militia to do something about the thieves.
<P></P>
Deciding on thieves and other guilds, the DM does not roll on Table 10 for
assassins and beggars. The DM isn't happy handling assassins, so he decides there
aren't any in town, obviating the need for a dice roll. With beggars, the DM
wants to choose Close Cooperation, details of which he records. This is a plot
element he wants to exploit later on. If the beggars spy on the merchants,
facilitating robberies in a place of only average wealth, it could help explain why
some of the merchants are at the end of their tether, too. Matters are beginning
to come together fairly nicely, but there is lots still to do. How about
bards? The DM rolls a 1, hostility! Very odd, and at this stage the DM just records
this without thinking about why. He decides to come back to this problem later.
<P></P>
From Table 11, the DM makes an initial recording of how many thieves live and
work in Mallain. The population is 17,000. The DM rolls in the &quot;5001-10,000&quot;
row, and twice in the &quot;Per extra 5,000&quot; row, in the Average (wealth) column.
These rolls are 2d6+2, and 1d6+2 (twice) respectively—a total of 4d6+6. This is
rolled as a total of 19, but the DM adds 10% to this because the law is tolerant,
for a total of 21. They need not all be guildmembers, of course; the DM needs
to know about the guild rulership to determine this. Recording the figure of 21,
the DM moves on.
<P></P>
A roll of 5 on Table 12 shows that the guild is ruled by a guildmaster. From
Table 14, the die rolls produce a picture of what this guildmaster is like. A
first roll of 18 shows he is weak. A second roll of 12, reduced to 11 because of
this weakness, makes him fairly cruel. A final roll of 12, reduced to 10
because of this cruelty, makes him fairly despotic. In summary: Weak, fairly cruel,
fairly despotic. A rather pathetic creature, all told. This comes to the rescue
of the DM when he rolls on Table 15 and comes up with a 20—Anarchy!
<P></P>
The DM is taken aback. There is a guild here, with a guildmaster, and now he
is plunged into a real complication. He is about to re-roll the dice, but spends
a minute or two in imaginative reverie. Perhaps, after all, this is workable.
An old, feeble, weak, guildmaster has lost his authority. He has resorted to
cruelty and despotism to try to hold on to his guildmaster status, but lacks the
strength even to do this effectively. Guildmembers have drifted away in open
contempt, but have not yet formed a separate guild (that would be Opposition, not
Anarchy). They don't have the heart to kill the old thief, either
(guildmasters appoint their own successors, the DM decides, so he'd have to be killed).
<P></P>
The DM rolls on Table 16 before all this has sunk in—if there isn't a guild,
how can it have relations with outsiders and freelancers? But the roll of 19,
Special Relationship, stimulates some further thoughts in the DM's head.
<P></P>
The DM decides that the guildmaster has managed to hang on to a small rump of
the guild—1d6, he decides, and rolls just 4. Later on, he will select these as
being primarily senior and compatible with the guildmaster's alignment. There
is no need for the standard percentile roll to determine the percentage in the
guild, because this is a special and very unusual circumstance. The other 16
thieves all work independently, maybe allying with each other in small groups for
the odd job now and then. Perhaps a lack of coordination among them means that
some targets are hit too often, which wouldn't happen if the guild was
coordinating matters properly. Maybe this is why some merchants are so desperate that
they want warfare declared on the thieves—this makes very good sense. It also
explains why the law is tolerant—they know it's going to be hard to track down
and deal with any central organization which really cuts the mustard in Mallain,
and the DM adds this detail to his notes.
<P></P>
The &quot;Special Relationship&quot; is that holding between the rump of the guild, and
the freelancers still in town. To complete the picture, though, the DM rolls
another d20—giving a result of 6, hostility. This is the attitude of all the
thieves of Mallain (or most of them!) to outsiders from beyond the town, to
complete the picture.
<P></P>
The DM now has to determine the levels of the thieves in Mallain. There are 21
thieves in the town, and from Table 17 the DM determines the levels of the
seniors as 8th, 6th, 4th (two), and 3rd. From the 5xd3 and 5xd2 rolls, another two
3rd-level and four 2nd-level are added. The remaining 10 thieves will all be
apprentices. The DM records these figures on some rough paper.
<P></P>
From Tables 18, 19, and 20 the DM makes die rolls to detail these thieves.
There are 5% half-elves and 5% halflings in Mallain, but no full elves or gnomes,
so the DM decides in advance to replace any elf rolled up with a half-elf, and
any gnome with a halfling. Two thieves were not rolled randomly; the 8th-level
human guildmaster, and the 6th-level half-elven thief the DM wants to use as a
plot element to advance the theme of anarchy within the guild.
<P></P>
The half-elf is a dashing, romantic rogue-figure who is the focus of the
opposition to the ailing old guildmaster. He has musicianship skills, and a brother
who is a bard—hence one reason for the guildmaster's hostility to bards (this
detail is added to the record sheet). This DM sees this character as very
chaotic, and one who doesn't wish to be guildmaster. But the old guildmaster hates
his charisma, youthfulness, and character, and has always blocked his progress.
Now he sees him as the enemy who has drawn away the other thieves—a special
relationship indeed, a very tempestuous and intrigue-ridden state of affairs. Added
to this is the fact that the half-elf doesn't want to be guildmaster, but the
juniors who have deserted the guild are begging him to lead them in a coup
against the old guard. He alone has the experience and charisma to do this. The DM
has been watching a few Errol Flynn movies of late. However, while Evlarel the
half-elf is chaotic good, the old guildmaster is Neutral—it is too obvious and
unsubtle to make him evil, which would submerge many of the intrigues into a
simplistic good-versus-evil battle. But most of those staying loyal are evil—if
they have to be eliminated, the DM prefers them to be evil than to encourage his
PCs to attack and kill neutrals.
<P></P>
After this flight of fancy the DM comes back to earth. The guild is in a state
of uproar and anarchy, but there are still some practical details to attend
to. Guild dues still have to be decided—these will be the old rates, which
applied when the guild was not torn asunder, but they are useful as a guide to what
the reformed guild (if it does reform) will accept. (The DM notes them in
brackets.) A similar consideration applies to normal resources, but the DM also notes
the present availability (poor) by way of an update. Special resources are
important—the DM determines that the thieves' guild has a government snitch, a
personal friend of the guildmaster, and this stool-pigeon is used to prime the
military to arrest the hapless half-elf, driving him further underground, and
making him an even more elusive and mysterious figure. The war between old Halradur
and Evlarel gets hotter by the moment.
<P></P>
As for major activities, the DM decides that in such a fairly boring town as
Mallain there is no scope for anything especially unusual. The declining
guildmaster would not have had the strength of will to maintain any really nefarious
activities. Individual thieves may kidnap, but the guild doesn't organize such
actions. The guildhouse is located in the cellars of a local tavern, the DM
decides; the Baron of Beef, run by one of the few thieves left who stays loyal to
Halradur. This isn't a particularly creative design element, but the DM knows
that matters are likely to be all-change in Mallain soon, and so can't be
bothered to think up anything especially unusual. The tavern will make a good location
for a final shoot-out in any event.
<P></P>
What began as a short exercise in rolling up a thieves' guild has now turned
into a powerful intrigue which could cast a long shadow over most aspects of
life in this town. The central struggle between an old guildmaster, with a small
evil coterie, and desperate young thieves looking to a reluctant new leader is
going to enmesh the unwary PCs as soon as they enter the place!
