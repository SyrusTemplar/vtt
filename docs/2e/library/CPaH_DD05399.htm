   <B>Description:</B> Devoutly religious, Divinates serve as the military branch of their church
and consider themselves soldiers of their gods. Their religious discipline imbues
them with a clear sense of purpose; promoting the principles of their faith is
not only morally correct, but a sacred duty.
<P></P>
<B>   Requirements:</B> Standard. A Divinate must be a member of an organized religion. Usually, the
church elders raise and train the Divinate from childhood.
<P></P>
   <B>Ministration:</B> Church.
<P></P>
<B>   Role:</B> Divinates were originally responsible for accompanying disciples of the
church on religious pilgrimages, fighting off bandits and monsters that lay in wait.
In time, church elders decided that <I>all</I> evils were potential threats to their disciples, and sent Divinates into the
world to eliminate them. To a Divinate, evil is an affront to his faith;
destroying an agent of evil is a holy act.
<P></P>
   Though the Divinate becomes a raging avenger when confronting evil, he is
otherwise thoughtful and compassionate. He sees himself as an advocate of the
common man, a source of solace to the downtrodden and disadvantaged. A Divinate may
insist that the party share its treasure with destitute families and
impoverished communities. He may offer temporary employment to a pauper too proud to
accept charity. He conducts impromptu prayer services in makeshift chapels, and
officiates at the christenings and burials of peasants. Though completely devoted
to his faith, a Divinate respects all lawful good religions and has little
interest in proselytizing.
<P></P>
<B>   Symbol:</B> A Divinate proudly displays the symbol of his church on his shield, coat of
arms, mount barding, and clothing. Typical symbols include a rising sun, holy
symbol, blooming flower, star, or the like, often with weapons below or behind
the symbol.
<P></P>
   <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Leather Worker, Mason, Scribe Tailor/Weaver, Weaponsmith, Woodworker/Carver.
<P></P>
<B>   Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Any.
<P></P>
   <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Required: </I>Religion. <I>Recommended:</I> Artistic Ability, Etiquette, Healing, Languages (Ancient and Modern),
Reading/Writing, Poetry.
<P></P>
   <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Standard.
<P></P>
<B>   Bonded Mount:</B> Any.
<P></P>
   <B>Special Benefits:</B>
<P></P>
<I>   Extra Sphere:</I> In addition to the Combat, Divination, Healing, and Protective spheres, a
Divinate may also learn spells from one of the following spheres: Charm, Guardian,
or Sun. He chooses this sphere at 1st level; once chosen, the extra sphere
never changes. The extra sphere has no effect on the number or level of spells he
can learn.
<P></P>
   <I>Religious Stronghold:</I> If a Divinate chooses to build a stronghold, it must be a monastery or other
religious edifice. If the Divinate has faithfully served his church and has
never committed a serious ethos violation, the church elders may officially
sanction his stronghold, contributing resources and labor to reduce construction
costs to half the normal price (the Divinate is still responsible for purchasing or
otherwise obtaining the land). Typically, official sanction is not given to a
Divinate until he reaches 12th level, so as not to offend the clerics who also
seek sanctions for their strongholds.
<P></P>
   <B>Special Hindrances:</B>
<P></P>
<I>   Extra Tithes:</I> A Divinate must donate 20% of all income to his church. Additionally, his
church requires a <I>minimum</I> monthly contribution, usually 1-10 gp (as determined by the DM). Therefore,
every month he must donate either 20% of his income or his minimum contribution,
whichever is greater. Failure to do so is considered an ethos violation of his
tithing stricture.
<P></P>
   <I>Meditation:</I> A Divinate must mediate for one full hour every day to cleanse his spirit,
preferably when he rises or just before he goes to sleep. If he is interrupted or
distracted for more than two consecutive rounds, he must start over. A
Divinate who neglects to meditate cannot cast spells the following day.
