The shield-rush is an attempt to knock someone down by running into them with
your shield. The character must have 10 feet (2 spaces) of running room to make
an effective shield-rush. Making a shield-rush is treated as a charge attack
for purposes of guarding characters with set spears.
<P></P>
When the character makes a shield-rush, he makes a normal attack against his
enemy’s AC. Some shields may provide modifiers or bonuses to the rush; refer to <A HREF="DD02740.htm#9e53bbbc"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02740.htm#9e53bbbc">Chapter Seven</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. After a shield has been used for a rush, it provides no AC bonus for the
rest of the round for its bearer. Making a shield-rush also costs the character a
normal attack, but it isn’t considered an off-hand weapon like a shield-punch.
<P></P>
If the shield-bearer hits with his attack, he makes an opposed Strength roll
against his opponent to see if he knocks him down. The loser of the opposed roll
falls down; if both characters fail their Strength rolls, they both fall down.
The following modifiers apply to the attacker’s Strength score:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> 4-point bonus or penalty for each size difference of the attacker versus the
defender;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> +3 if the defender was unaware of the shield-rush;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> –2 if the defender has four legs or more.
<P></P>
<P></P>
As noted before, monsters can be assumed to have a Strength of 31/2 per size
category plus their Hit Dice. Instead of an opposed roll, the DM can substitute
a saving throw vs. paralyzation for the defender to save time.
<P></P>
If the shield-rusher misses with his attack roll, he must roll a successful
Dexterity check to stay on his feet as he rushes past his target. If he fails, he
falls down.

*A Shield Rush is performed in the attacker’s base initiative phase.
<P></P>
**The knockdown bonus is used during the opposed Strength check that takes
place if the attack hits (see <A HREF="DD02486.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02486.htm">Chapter Two</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, page 46). If the character’s Strength check succeeds, add the listed number
to the roll before the two rolls are compared.
