The divination spells of 4th-level and below are collectively known as the
school of lesser divination. Lesser divination is considered to be a minor school
of magic; that is, wizards can't become specialists in lesser divination.
<P></P>
The term &quot;minor&quot; is used informally in this context. It means that specialists
from any school are allowed to learn and use these spells. Many of the lesser
divination spells, such as <I>detect magic</I> and <I>read magic</I> are basic to the practice of magic. Others, such as <I>identify, ESP</I>, and <I>know alignment</I> are vital to the basic repertoire of any specialist. Without access to the
spells of lesser divination, a wizard's ability to function would be
frustratingly limited, particularly at the lower levels.
<P></P>
At first glance, the existence of the school of lesser divination would seem
to reduce the role of the diviner; after all, no other school allows all
specialists such easy access to their low-level spells. However, an examination of the
requirements for all schools shows that only the conjurer has greater
divination as an opposition school; every other specialist has access to the low-level
divination spells. In practice, the existence of the minor school of lesser
divination serves only to give the conjurer access to the low-level divination
spells.
<P></P>
Although all specialists can learn lesser divination spells, they cannot learn
them any more easily or effectively than they can learn spells from schools
other than their own. All non-diviners learn lesser divination spells at a
penalty of -15 percent on the Intelligence Table (Table 4, page 16<I> <A HREF="PHB_DD01432.htm"></A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="PHB_DD01432.htm">PHB</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">); for instance, either a conjurer or an illusionist with an Intelligence of
15 has a 50 percent chance of learning any given lesser divination spell.
<P></P>
All lesser divination spells are also considered to be part of the school of
greater divination. Therefore, a diviner has a 15 percent bonus on the
Intelligence Table to learn lesser divination spells; for instance, a diviner with an
Intelligence of 15 has an 80 percent chance of learning any lesser divination
spell.
