</B> The <I>spike stones</I> spell causes rock to shape itself into long, sharp points that tend to blend
into the background. It is effective on both natural rock and worked stone. The
spike stones serve to impede progress through an area and to inflict damage.
If an area is carefully observed, each observer is 25% likely to notice the
sharp points of rock. Otherwise, those entering the spell's area of effect suffer
1d4 points of damage per round. The success of each attack is determined as if
the caster of the spell were actually engaging in combat. Those entering the
area are subject to attack immediately upon setting foot in the area and for each
round spent in the area thereafter. The initial step enables the individual to
become aware of some problem only if the initial attack succeeds; otherwise
movement continues and the spike stones remain unnoticed until damage occurs.
Charging or running victims suffer two attacks per round.
<P></P>
Those falling into pits affected by spike stones suffer six such attacks for
every 10 feet fallen, each attack having a +2 bonus to the attack roll. In
addition, the damage inflicted by each attack increases by +2 for every 10 feet
fallen. Finally, the creatures also suffer normal falling damage.
<P></P>
The material component of this spell is four tiny stalactites.
