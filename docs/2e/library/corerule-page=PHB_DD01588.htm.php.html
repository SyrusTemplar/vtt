must be chosen when the proficiency is chosen. Additional proficiency slots can
be used to learn how to handle other types of mounts. Unlike land-based riding,
a character must have this proficiency (or ride with someone who does) to
handle a flying mount. In addition, a proficient character can do the following:
<P></P>
• Leap onto the saddle of the creature (when it is standing on the ground) and
spur it airborne as a single action. This requires no proficiency check.
<P></P>
• Leap from the back of the mount and drop 10 feet to the ground or onto the
back of another mount (land-based or flying). Those with only light encumbrance
can drop to the ground without a proficiency check. In all other situations, a
proficiency check is required. A failed roll means the character takes normal
falling damage (for falling flat on his face) or misses his target (perhaps
taking large amounts of damage as a result). A character who is dropping to the
ground can attempt an immediate melee attack, if his proficiency check is made
with a -4 penalty to the ability roll. Failure has the consequences given above.
<P></P>
• Spur his mount to greater speeds on a successful check, adding 1d4 to the
movement rate of the mount. This speed can be maintained for four consecutive
rounds. If the check fails, an attempt can be made again the next round. If two
checks fail, no attempt can be made for a full turn. After the rounds of
increased speed, its movement drops to 2/3 its normal rate and its Maneuverability
Class (see <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01419.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01419.htm.php.html">Glossary</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">) becomes one class worse. These conditions last until the mount lands and is
allowed to rest for at least one hour.
<P></P>
• The rider can guide the mount with his knees and feet, keeping his hands
free. A proficiency check is made only after the character suffers damage. If
the check is failed, the character is knocked from the saddle. A second check is
allowed to see if the character manages to catch himself (thus hanging from the
side by one hand or in some equally perilous position). If this fails, the
rider falls. Of course a rider can strap himself into the saddle, although this
could be a disadvantage if his mount is slain and plummets toward the ground.
