The same is not true of dual-class characters.
<P></P>
If a human character starts off as a thief, he may take any of the Thief Kits
above. If, later, he decides to change classes according to the normal
Dual-Class Benefits and Restrictions rules, he doesn't lose any of the benefits or
hindrances of the kit he chose; he is still that sort of thief.
<P></P>
If a character starts off as some other character class and then, later,
switches to one of the thief classes, he can choose a Thief Kit at that time, though
the DM may insist that certain campaign events take place in order to allow
him to do this.
<P></P>
For instance, let us suppose that a human fighter decides, later in life, to
become a thief, and he wants to be an Acrobat. There's nothing wrong with that,
but the DM should insist that the next several adventures deal with the
transformation. The character could join a circus, perhaps, where he could be taught
the tricks of the trade. Adventures should be built around this setting, and
should somehow involve other player-characters in the campaign as well.
<P></P>
To better simulate the wait involved for the character to learn his new trade,
the DM is within his rights to insist that the character not receive his Thief
Kit until he's reached second experience level in his new class.
