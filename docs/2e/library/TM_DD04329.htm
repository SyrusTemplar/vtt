This spell enables the caster to reach into the subject's mind and modify up
to five minutes of his memory in one of the following ways:
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">?</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Eliminate all memory of an event the subject actually experienced. This spell
cannot negate <I>charm, suggestion, geas, quest</I>, or similar spells.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">?</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Allow the subject to recall with perfect clarity an event he actually
experienced. For instance, he could recall every word from a five-minute conversation
or every detail from a passage in a book.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">?</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Change the details of an event the subject actually experienced.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3">?</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced.
<P></P>
Casting the spell takes one round. If the subject fails to save vs. spell, the
caster proceeds with the spell by spending up to five minutes visualizing the
memory he wishes to modify in the subject. If the caster's concentration is
disturbed before the visualization is complete, the spell is lost.
<P></P>
<I>Modified memory</I> will not necessarily affect the subject's actions, particularly if they
contradict his natural inclinations. An illogical <I>modified memory</I>, such as the subject recalling how much he enjoyed drinking poison, will be
dismissed by the subject as a bad dream or a memory muddied by too much wine.
More useful applications of <I>modified memory</I> include implanting memories of friendly encounters with the caster (inclining
the subject to act favorably toward the caster), changing the details of
orders given to the subject by a superior, or causing the subject to forget that the
caster cheated him in a card game. The DM reserves the right to decide whether
a <I>modified memory</I> is too nonsensical to significantly affect the subject.
