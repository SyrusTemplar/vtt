<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Deep Diving:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character with this proficiency can add 10 feet per round to his speed of
descent when diving into the water, or from the surface. Thus, a character with
the deep diving proficiency can descend 30 feet per round, plus modifiers for
encumbrance, running start, and height. Likewise, a character with the deep
diving proficiency can surface at a rate of 30 feet (not 20 feet) per round.
<P></P>
This proficiency provides characters with the ability to hold their breath for
2/3 their Constitution scores in rounds, not the 1/3 allowed to most
characters. Effects of exceeding the allotted time are the same, regardless of
proficiency ratings.
