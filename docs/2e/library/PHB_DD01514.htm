<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="5"><B>Dual-Class Benefits and Restrictions
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Only humans can be dual-classed characters. To be dual-classed, the character
must have scores of 15 or more in the prime requisites of his first class and
scores of 17 or more in the prime requisites of any classes he switches to. The
character selects one class to begin his adventuring life. He can advance in
this class as many levels as he desires before switching to another class; there
is no cut-off point beyond which a character cannot switch. However, he must
attain at least 2nd level in his current class before changing to another class.
There is no limit to the number of classes a character can acquire, as long as
he has the ability scores and wants to make the change. (Certain character
classes have alignment restrictions that the character must meet, however.)
<P></P>
Any time after reaching 2nd level, a human character can enter a new character
class, provided he has scores of 17 or better in the prime requisites of the
new class. After switching to a new class, the character no longer earns
experience points in his previous character class and he can no longer advance in
level in that class. Nor can he switch back to his first class at a later date,
hoping to resume his advancement where he left off. Once he leaves a class he has
finished his studies in it. Instead, he starts over in a new class, at 1st
level with 0 experience points, but he does retain his previous Hit Dice and hit
points. He gains the abilities, and must abide by all of the restrictions, of the
new class. He does not gain or lose any points on his ability scores (for
example, an 18 Strength wizard who changes to fighter does not gain the percentile
Strength bonus, but likewise a fighter changing to a wizard would not lose it).
The character uses the combat and saving throw tables appropriate to his new
class and level.
<P></P>
This is not to imply that a dual-class human forgets everything he knew
before; he still has, at his fingertips, all the knowledge, abilities, and
proficiencies of his old class. <I>But if he uses any of his previous class's abilities during an encounter, he
earns no experience for that encounter and only half experience for the
adventure.</I> The only values that can be carried over from the previous class without
restriction are the character's Hit Dice and hit points. The character is penalized
for using his old attack or saving throw numbers, weapons or armor that are
now prohibited, and any special abilities of the old class that are not also
abilities of the new class. (The character is trying to learn new ways to do
things; by slipping back to his old methods, he has set back his learning in his new
character class.)
<P></P>
In addition, the character earns no additional Hit Dice or hit points while
advancing in his new class.
<P></P>
The restrictions in the previous two paragraphs last until the character
reaches a <I>higher</I> level in his new class than his maximum level in any of his previous classes.
At that point, both restrictions are dropped: the character gains the
abilities of his previous classes without jeopardizing his experience points for the
adventure, and he earns additional Hit Dice (those of his new class) and hit
points for gaining experience levels in his new class.
<P></P>
Once these restrictions are lifted, the character must still abide by the
restrictions of whichever class he is using at the moment. A dual-class
fighter/mage, for example, cannot cast spells while wearing armor.

<I> Tarus Blood-heart begins his career as a cleric with a Wisdom of 16. He rises
to 3rd level and then decides to become a fighter, since his Strength is 17. He
keeps his 14 hit points (rolled on 3d8), but in all other ways he is treated
as a 1st-level fighter. Upon reaching 4th level, Tarus is allowed to roll 1d10
for additional hit points. He can now cast spells as a 3rd-level cleric and
fight as a 4th-level fighter. For the rest of his career, Tarus advances as a
fighter but retains his minor clerical powers--a useful advantage when the situation
gets ugly!
<P></P>

<P></P>
When a dual-class or multi-class character is struck by a level-draining
creature, he first loses levels in the class in which he has advanced the highest.
When his different classes are equal in level, the class level requiring the
most experience points is lost first.
<P></P>
The player character is allowed to regain levels lost by level draining, but
until he regains all of his former levels, he must select which class he will
use prior to any particular adventure. Using abilities of the other class then
subjects him to the experience penalties given earlier. When he regains all of
his former levels, he is then free to use all the abilities of all his classes
once again. Of course, he cannot raise his earlier class(es) above the level(s)
he was at when he switched class.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I> Tarus is a 4th-level cleric/3rd-level fighter. He is struck by a wight and
loses one level from his cleric class, since it is his highest level. If struck
again, he would lose one level from his fighter class. Thereafter he could regain
his lost levels, but would have to choose to act as either a fighter or
cleric. Once he earned enough experience to regain his previous fighter level, he
would not be allowed to advance further in it (restoring himself to his previous
level only). But he could still advance as a cleric and use his 3rd-level
fighter abilities.
