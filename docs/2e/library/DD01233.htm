A world?s technological rating determines its general level of cultural
development, scholarship, and practical application of knowledge and invention. The
lower a world?s technological rating, the less obvious the trappings of
civilization are. A rating of 2 indicates no technology at all. A rating of 10?12
indicates a medieval technology common to most AD&amp;D campaigns. Ratings of 13 or
higher indicate worlds that are progressively more urban, institutional, and
mechanized. It is entirely possible for a world to have both a high magical rating
and a high technological rating. On such worlds, magical devices replace machines.
