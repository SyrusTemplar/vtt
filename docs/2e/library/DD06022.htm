For the well-trained rogue, jewelry swindles can be both the most lucrative
and the easiest, because it is so difficult for the untrained eye to identify or
to judge the value of a precious stone. Besides dealing in paste and glass
fakes, jewelry swindlers may pass off a lesser stone as something more valuable
(e.g., quartz for diamond), or pay someone (especially naive but treasure-laden
adventurers) for a diamond as if it were quartz. A nimble-fingered rogue may also
replace fake jewels for real ones, and the owner may never know the difference!
<P></P>
Sly NPC jewel swindlers are a great way for DMs to relieve characters lacking
gem cutting proficiency of their cash and jewels (provided they don't spew out
at the start, &quot;The dragon's treasure includes 12 opals at 1,000 gp each&quot;).

<I>&quot;How much d'I owe ya?&quot; asked the old rogue, upon finishing ale and tale.
<P></P>
&quot;Four coppers,&quot; said the bartender.
<P></P>
The rogue fished in his pockets. &quot;Hmm,&quot; he said. &quot;All I have is this gold
piece. Have ya got change?&quot;
<P></P>
&quot;Believe I do,&quot; said the bartender, taking the gold coin and putting out an
electrum coin, four silvers, and six coppers in change.
<P></P>
&quot;Say, why don't you get me a slab of cheese for the road?&quot; asked the rogue,
sliding over two coppers for it.
<P></P>
While the bartender retrieved the cheese from beneath the counter, the rogue
opened his pouch to put the remaining coppers inside. &quot;Well look here! Guess I
had a silver after all!&quot; he declared. He moved his hand toward the others,
palming his new-found silver and hiding the electrum beneath the other coins, while
appearing just to set the new silver coin with the rest. &quot;Say,&quot; he tells the
bartender. &quot;I'd be hatin' to take all yer change like that. Why dontcha gimme an
electrum for these five silvers?&quot;
<P></P>
&quot;Sure,&quot; said the bartender, handing him an electrum. The old rogue turned
toward the door. &quot;Wait!&quot; said the bartender. &quot;Ye left an electrum coin here with
the silver!&quot;
<P></P>
&quot;So I did! Thank you. Honesty's a difficult quality to find these days! Well,
to keep you with enough change, why don't I just give you this silver&quot;-he then
produced the coin he had palmed?&quot;and you give me back the gold piece?&quot;
<P></P>
&quot;All right,&quot; said the bartender. &quot;Have a nice day, then!&quot;
<P></P>
As he walked down the street from the tavern, five silvers richer, the old
rogue permitted himself a grin and a little skip of delight. All these years, and
Cool Willie hadn't lost his touch.
