This spell allows creatures targeted by the caster to become virtually
weightless and be lifted upon the wind. Affected creatures can control their altitude
by rising or descending at a movement rate of 12, but are at the mercy of the
wind for speed and direction. Recipients can stop forward movement only by
grasping something to anchor them in place. If no wind is present, this spell has no
effect.
<P></P>
Unwilling targets are allowed a saving throw to resist the effect.
<P></P>
Each subject and his equipment must weigh less than 100 pounds per level of
the caster. Thus, a 6th-level wizard could affect six creatures each weighing
600lbs. or less. This spell may be cast only on living creatures.
<P></P>
The material components are a small handful of straw and a dry leaf.
