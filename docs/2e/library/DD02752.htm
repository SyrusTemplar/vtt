</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The term “bombard” encompasses a broad category of nonstandardized, primitive
gunpowder weapons that fire large stone or iron balls in a high arch. A typical
bombard has a short, thick barrel cast from bronze and set in a rigid wooden
base. More advanced siege mortars from the cannon era also use the bombard
statistics.

A single shot from a normal bombard requires 10 charges of <I>smoke powder </I>or gunpowder; a great bombard requires 20 charges, and both types of bombards
are subject to misfiring (see <A HREF="DD02752.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02752.htm">Chapter Seven</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> for details). The heat and debris left in the barrel after firing accounts
for the weapon’s relatively slow rate of fire, as the weapon must be cooled and
cleaned before it can fire again.

A bombard’s facing is fixed at the beginning of a battle; a full crew working
nonstop for 30 minutes can change a bombard’s facing 45 degrees. For a partial
crew, add 10 minutes to the time requirement for each missing crew member; a
crew at half strength cannot move a bombard.

The bombard’s thunderous roar can confuse or panic creatures unaccustomed to
loud noises or normally fearful of thunder. This includes most creatures with a
basic morale score of 10 or less and any creature generally unfamiliar with
explosives or magic. Such creatures must check morale if they are within 40 yards
of a bombard when it fires. Creatures usually lose their fear of a bombard’s
noise if they win an encounter against an enemy armed with one or if they spend a
month or so getting accustomed to the sound.
