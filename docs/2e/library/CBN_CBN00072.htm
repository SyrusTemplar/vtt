</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">In every society, there is some form of scapegoat, a small group of people who
are blamed or held accountable for the countless unexplainable tragedies in
human existence. As late as the so-called Enlightenment, Western society blamed
the witch for kidnappings, unexplained fires, tainted wells, rampant plagues,
and mysterious deaths. Countless women bearing the signs of a “stereotypical”
witch were rounded up, tortured until they confessed to crimes they did not
commit, and finally burned at the stake to purify the community.

In the campaign, a necromancer may experience similar, severe public
discrimination whenever his or her profession becomes known in a social context. At one
extreme, based on the witch-hunting atmosphere of Europe during the 16th–17th
centuries, the practice of black magic, or indeed any form of necromancy, may be
punishable by death or (if the wizard is exceedingly powerful) shameful exile.
At the very least, no society which is ruled by a good or neutral ruler will
tolerate the open practice of the Black Arts. Even in a dark and gritty campaign
where the forces of evil run rampant in society, a known necromancer will be
viewed with open fear, suspicion, and hatred.
<P></P>
Discrimination can take a wide variety of forms. A perceived necromancer may
be barred from a particular tavern, shop, or home (or even from an entire
village) once his or her profession is recognized. Vigilantes, bounty hunters, rival
mages, or even adventuring parties may try to eliminate a visiting necromancer,
hoping to bolster their position in the community, gain a few new magical
items, and possibly collect a reward from the local authorities.
<P></P>
Necromancers that need or choose to live in civilization must disguise their
profession to escape unwanted attention, especially at low levels. Not
surprisingly, most practitioners of the Art tend to shun human society, preferring the
lawless expanse of the wilderness where their deeds and experiments can go
unnoticed and unpunished.
