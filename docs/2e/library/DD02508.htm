<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Dueling </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">When two skilled fighters meet in personal combat, their contest runs far
deeper than simple attacks, blocks, or traps. If a boxer dodges to his left when
his opponent throws a right jab, or ducks when his opponent throws a body punch,
heâ€™s at a distinct disadvantage. The same thing can happen in a melee between
two armed combatants.

The subtle patterns of attack and defense create temporary advantages or
disadvantages for characters involved in a duel. Leaping over a low axe sweep is a
great way to avoid getting hit . . . but what if you guessed wrong and your
opponent aimed high? This section presents an optional set of rules for resolving
duels between skilled warriors.
