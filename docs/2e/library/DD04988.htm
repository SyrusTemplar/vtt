The <I>wall of sound</I> spell brings forth an immobile, shimmering curtain of violently disturbed
air. The wall is made up of a number of 10'x10' sections equal to the caster's
level. These sections can be arranged as desired as long as the resulting wall all
lies in one plane ( i.e., it must be flat) that stands up vertically.
<P></P>
One side of the wall, selected by the caster, produces a voluminous roar that
completely disrupts all communication, command words, verbal spell components,
and any other form of organized sound within 30 feet. In addition, those within
10 feet are deafened for 1d4 turns if they fail a saving throw vs. spell.
<P></P>
On the other side of the wall, a loud roar can be heard, but communication is
possible by shouting, and verbal components and command words function normally.
<P></P>
Anyone passing through the wall suffers 1d8 points of damage and is
permanently deafened unless he rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell. Deafened
creatures suffer a -1 penalty to surprise rolls, a +1 penalty to their initiative
rolls, and they are 20% likely to miscast spells with a verbal component.
<P></P>
A <I>silence 15' radius</I> spell cast by a higher level caster specifically for this purpose will dispel
the wall; the wall otherwise destroys all <I>silence </I>spells that come into contact with it.
<P></P>
The material component is a piece of slate and a finger nail clipping.
