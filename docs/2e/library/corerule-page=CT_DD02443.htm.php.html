<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">If a character or monster spends one round resting, making no moves or attacks
of any kind, he gets the chance to recover one category of fatigue (exhausted
to fatigued, fatigued to fresh) by rolling a successful saving throw vs.
paralyzation. Characters modify the die roll by a cumulative +1 bonus for each
consecutive round they spend resting. The characterâ€™s hit-point bonus for exceptional
Constitution is also used as a modifier to the recovery roll.
<P></P>
When a character recovers a fatigue category, his fatigue number is re-set all
the way back to its original value. He gets a second wind and can rejoin the
fray.
