Monsters with Spell-like Abilities
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Many monsters have the innate ability to use certain spells simply by an act
of will. Most extraplanar monsters have an array of spell-like powers as
formidable as the spell arsenal of a high-level wizard or priest, sylvan creatures
such as dryads or brownies can <I>charm </I>or <I>confuse </I>their opponents, and even dragons have a handful of spell-like abilities based
on their color and age. In fact, any monster that can use spell effects
without an equivalent wizard or priest character level falls into this category.
<P></P>
Spell-like abilities are invoked by one round of concentration; the monster
can do nothing else in that round except use a single power, just like a wizard
or priest may only cast one spell per round. All spell-like abilities have an
initiative modifier of +3, or <I>fast </I>under <I>Player-s Option: <A HREF="CT_DD02426.htm"></A></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="CT_DD02426.htm">Combat &amp; Tactics</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>rules. Unlike a true spellcaster, a monster with spell-like abilities can-t be
interrupted by damage or distraction-if the creature survives the injury, the
power functions that round regardless. (However, if a monster has both
spell-like abilities and normal spells, any spells it actually casts can be
interrupted.)
<P></P>
Unless otherwise stated in the monster-s description, spell-like abilities are
considered to have an effective casting level equal to the monster-s Hit Dice,
or the minimum character level necessary to use its highest-level ability,
whichever is better. For example, a brownie has only half a Hit Die, but its
spell-like abilities include <I>confusion </I>and <I>dimension door</I>, which are 4th-level wizard spells. Since a wizard must be at least 7th level
to use 4th-level spells, a brownie-s spell-like abilities function as if it
were a 7th-level caster. (Refer to <A HREF="PHB_DD01471.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01471.htm">Table 21</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Wizard Spell Progression or <A HREF="PHB_DD01479.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01479.htm">Table 24</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Priest Spell Progression in the <I>Player-s Handbook</I>.) This affects range, damage, duration, and all other level-based
characteristics of a spell. A list of monsters from the Monstrous Manual tome with
spell-like abilities follows, along with their effective casting level. Only creatures
that don-t have a casting level noted are mentioned here in <A HREF="DD03448.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03448.htm">Table 7</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Monster Casting Levels-you may want to note these in your copy of the book.
<P></P>
A creature with a spell-like ability may choose to use it simply by
concentrating for one round. If the power can be maintained, the monster doesn-t need to
concentrate to maintain it through the spell-s normal duration; after that, the
monster must spend a round reactivating the power. For example, a brownie-s
abilities include <I>protection from evil</I>, which has a duration of 2 rounds/level, or 14 rounds for a brownie. By
invoking the power once, the brownie is affected by the spell for 13 more rounds,
and it can then spend a round invoking the power again to be protected for
another 14 rounds. This means that the monster may be able to invoke a power and then
engage in physical attacks or take other actions while the power is active.
<P></P>
On the other hand, some spell-like abilities require the caster-s continuing
attention while they-re active, such as a <I>phantasmal force </I>or <I>ventriloquism </I>spell. Invoking the power takes only one round, as described above, but after
that the monster must spend each round concentrating on the power and doing
nothing else in order to maintain it. A monster with multiple spell-like abilities
can have any number of powers active at one time, as long as it spends one
round invoking each and continues to concentrate on any powers that need its
attention.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Restrictions: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Generally, monsters with spell-like abilities are free of any restrictions
normally associated with those spells; a monster with wizard spells among its
spell-like abilities is not a wizard and may use any armor or weapons it cares to.
Similarly, a monster with priest spells doesn-t have the ability to turn undead
or any granted powers specific to a certain priesthood. No components are
necessary, but the DM may rule that a bound and gagged monster may not be able to
invoke certain abilities.
<P></P>
Many monsters with spell-like abilities may only make use of them a certain
number of times per day; for example, a juvenile black dragon may use <I>darkness </I>three times per day, while a marilith tanar-ri may <I>polymorph self </I>up to seven times per day.
