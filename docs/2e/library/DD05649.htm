If a priest violates his order's restrictions on weapon and armor use, the god
will punish him for it. There are two different types of violation of this
restriction, and a different punishment for each.
<P></P>
If the priest deliberately violates the restriction because he wants to (for
instance, if he puts on a set of metal armor when he isn't supposed to), this is
a willful disobedience and makes the god very angry. He immediately does 2-12
(2d6) points of damage to the priest and takes away all the spells he granted
to the priest today, and doesn't let the priest have any more for 1-6 (1d6)
days. Even then, the priest must undergo rituals of purification and undertake an
act of atonement if he's to have spells again.
<P></P>
If the priest violates the restriction for the best of reasons (for instance,
if a gargoyle is strangling his friend, and he must use a forbidden weapon in
order to be able to harm the creature), the god does 1-3 (1d3) points of damage
to the priest (<I>after the fight is done</I>) and, if the priest does not undertake a ritual of purification at his
earliest opportunity, will take away the priest's spells on the next day.
