<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The hapless Anada finds himself forced into a gladiatorial combat by his
bugbear captors. His opponent is Barzun, a 7th-level dwarf fighter. Anada decides he
doesn’t wish to kill his fellow prisoner and decides to attack to subdue
instead. Barzun wears plate mail and carries a shield, giving her an Armor Class of
2. Anada wins initiative and rolls a 12. Anada’s THAC0 is 13, so his roll is
good enough to hit even before adding the +1 attack bonus Anada gets for his 17
Strength, but not good enough for a critical hit. The DM decides Anada should
roll 1d4 to determine the morning star’s subdual damage (but the DM could have
decided to roll 2d4 and divide the result by two). Anada rolls a 3; Barzun
suffers 4 points of damage (+1 for Anada’s Strength). Three points are temporary and
1 point is normal.
<P></P>
Barzun decides to reply with a subdual attack as well. Anada’s Dexterity and <I>chain mail +1 </I>give him an Armor Class of 3. Barzun rolls a 10. Her THAC0 is 14, making her
roll barely good enough to hit after adding the +1 attack bonus from her 18/21
Strength. Barzun rolls a 2 for damage; she adds +3 for her Strength and inflicts
5 points on Anada, 4 temporary and 1 normal.
<P></P>
Anada wins initiative again and declares a no-move attack. He attacks once
with his morning star in the average phase and again in the slow phase (because he
is 8th level and entitled to an extra melee attack this round). Barzun also
declares a no move attack and gets attacks in the average and slow phases.
Because she lost initiative, Barzun strikes last in each phase. Anada’s first attack
hits with a 15. There is no chance for a critical hit, and he inflicts 4 points
of damage again (3 temporary and 1 normal). Barzun misses her attack, and
combat proceeds to the next phase.
<P></P>
Anada hits again and inflicts 5 points of damage. Barzun has now suffered 13
points of damage (10 temporary and 3 normal). Barzun’s final attack hits with a
20. She only needed to roll a 10, so the 20 is good enough for a critical hit.
Anada suffers 2d4+3 points of damage (the morning star’s 1d4 subdual damage is
doubled to 2d4 and Barzun’s +3 damage bonus is added). Barzun rolls a 6,
inflicting 9 points of damage, 7 of which are temporary and two that are normal.
Anada has now suffered 14 points of damage, 11 temporary and 3 normal. Barzun opts
to knock out Anada rather than rolling for a critical hit. Anada rolls a 2,
failing his saving throw vs. death; he will be unconscious for 3d10 combat rounds
and the gladiatorial fight ends, much to the bugbears’ disappointment.
