</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Overbearing involves brute force and is the natural attack form for groups of
creatures confronting a lone target. In the case of multiple defenders, the
attackers can divide themselves among their opponents or concentrate on a single
defender, provided that the attackers occupy squares adjacent to the defender.
<P></P>
The defender's allies, if clear, can remove attackers from the pile by making
overbearing or wrestling attacks against them. An ally who threatens the
attackers can make attacks of opportunity each time the attackers initiate an opposed
roll-the arrival of an armed ally usually breaks up a massed overbearing
attack. A critical hit or knockdown can force an attacker to release a defender, as
described above.
<P></P>
Missile attacks directed at a pile have a chance to hit any character in the
pile as described in <A HREF="DD02429.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02429.htm">Chapter One</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
