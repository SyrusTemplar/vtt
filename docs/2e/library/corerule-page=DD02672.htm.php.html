Humanoid and partially humanoid creatures with racial intelligence of at least
low can make pummeling attacks. Nonhumanoid creatures with racial intelligence
of at least average and with manipulative appendages at least as large and
strong as human hands and arms also can pummel. Humans, demihumans, orcs, ogres,
giants, centaurs, and similar creatures can make pummeling attacks. Great cats,
octopi, oozes, horses, and other creatures who lack intelligence or prehensile
appendages cannot. Common sense must apply. For example, the DM might allow
androsphinxes to make pummeling attacks if they retract their claws. Generally,
however, creatures with natural attacks use them in preference to pummeling
attacks.

Pummeling requires at least one free hand, although the attacker may wear a
metal gauntlet or similar item. A character may also use a weapon pommel or an
improvised weapon, such as a mug or bottle, in a pummeling attack. Attacks with
improvised weapons provoke attacks of opportunity just as other brawling attacks
do.
<P></P>
The target of a pummeling attack must be alive, non-vegetable, organic, and
non-fluid. Undead, shambling mounds, golems, and jellies are among the many
creatures that cannot be pummeled.

Pummeling is ineffective against creatures who can be harmed only by special
or magical weapons unless the attacker functions as a magical weapon powerful
enough to hurt the creature (see <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00458.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00458.htm.php.html">DMG</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, Table 46; note that character levels never apply to the table). Elementals,
fiends, and most extraplanar creatures are immune to pummeling unless attacked
by similar creatures or by characters using magical weapons.
<P></P>
Creatures immune to blunt (type B) weapons are immune to pummeling attacks.
<P></P>
No creature can pummel an opponent more than one size larger than itself
unless the target is not standing up (prone, kneeling, or sitting) or the attacker
has a height advantage or can fly. For example, a halfling usually cannot pummel
a hill giant.
