<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>Determining Effects and Levels</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Once the inappropriate spells have been discarded, we
need to define and describe the specific effects of the remaining
spells, then assign them to levels. The description of a spell should
cover its typical uses, but it is unnecessary-- and realistically,
impossible-- to deal with every possible application. More
importantly, the description should cover the spell's limitations in
detail; not only do precise limitations make spells easier to
adjudicate, they are easier to assign to levels.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Here are some points to consider when assigning
limitations to spells:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>How many subjects can be affected by the spell?</I>
Generally, the more subjects affected, the higher the level of the
spell (compare <I>invisibility</I> to <I>mass invisibility</I>, and <I>charm
person</I> to<I> mass charm</I> ).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>What type of subjects can be affected by the spell?</I>
Subjects can be low-level or high-level (or low HD and high HD). They
can also have specific characteristics (such as the subjects of <I>detect
invisibility</I>), or they can be general types with no specific
characteristics (such as the subjects of <I>charm monster</I> ).
Usually, higher-level spells are able to affect high-level (or high
HD) subjects that have no specific characteristics-- <I>finger of death</I>
is a good example.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>Are victims allowed a saving throw to avoid the
effects of the spell?</I> Disallowing a saving throw for a spell that
would normally have one usually boosts it to a higher level. For
instance, the 5th-level<I> cone of cold</I> allows a saving throw to
reduce a victim's damage by half. If such a throw were not allowed,
the spell would be significantly more dangerous and would belong in a
higher level.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>If the spell causes damage, what is the maximum?</I>
It would be grossly inappropriate for any 1st-level spell to inflict
100 hit points of damage. Similarly, a 9th-level spell should be
capable of inflicting a significant amount of damage. Table 2
suggests the maximum amount of damage a spell of a particular level
should be allowed to inflict on a single enemy. These figures are
general guidelines only, and can be altered by any number of
variables. For instance, if a hypothetical 3rd-level<I> flying sword</I>
spell has only a 10 percent chance of hitting its target, its maximum
amount of damage could be justifiably higher than 3-18 hit points.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Remember that the inflicted damage of certain spells
may vary according to the caster's level; for instance, fireball
causes 1d6 hit points of damage per level of the caster. (Table 2
gives the damage for a spell cast at its base level; if our hypothetical<I>
flying sword</I> spell is 3rd-level, but can be cast at higher levels
to inflict more damage, Table 2 indicates the maximum amount of
damage it can cause when cast at its lowest level. )</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3">* Spells of 7th-level through 9th- level are
differentiated by the number of subjects destroyed and special
restrictions on death. For instance, a 7th-level spell might destroy
only a single subject, while a 9th-level spell could destroy several.
A 7th-level spell might allow a saving throw, while a 9th-level spell
might not. A 7th-level spell might allow<I> resurrection</I>
attempts, a 9th-level spell might not.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>If the spell causes damage, do victims get a saving throw?</I>
Of the spells in the <I>Player's Handbook</I>, many of them allow the
victim to make a saving throw in order to reduce or eliminate the
potential damage. Though it is unnecessary to allow saving throws in
every case, this is a good way to add balance to what otherwise might
be an especially dangerous spell. There are three options to consider.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>1. No saving throw.</B> This option maximizes a
spell's lethality.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>2. Half damage.</B> This option means that the
character suffers half-damage if his saving throw is successful. This
is less lethal than a spell with no saving throw, but more lethal
than the following option.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>3.</B> <B>Negate.</B> This option means that the
character suffers no damage if his saving throw is successful. This
is the least lethal option of all.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Note that saving throws need not always be saving
throws vs. spells; consider different types of saving throws for
spells of higher levels (in every case, however, only one type of
saving throw should be allowed). A saving throw vs. spells is always
an option, no matter what the level of spell, but here are some alternatives:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> For spells of
3rd-level and 4th-level, use save vs. rods.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> For spells of
5th-level and 6th-level, use save vs. paralyzation.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> For spells of
7th-level, 8th-level, and 9th-level, use save vs. death.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>If the spell is defensive, does it inhibit the
enemy's ability to attack, or does it offer direct protection from damage?</I>
Generally, spells that defend against a specific type of damage (such
as <I>protection from normal missiles</I>) are less powerful than
spells that protect against a general category of damage (such as <I>minor
globe of invulnerability</I>), and spells that protect the caster or
subjects of the caster's choice (such as <I>protection from evil</I>)
are less powerful than spells that inhibit the enemy's ability to
attack (such as <I>wall of fog</I>). The highest-level defensive
spells tend to be those that get rid of the attacker (such as <I>dismissal
</I>and <I>imprisonment</I>.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">If a DM has designed a defensive spell that he wants
to modify so he can assign it to a higher level, he can do one or
more of the following:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Increase the types
of damage against which it protects. (To assign the spell to a lower
level, decrease the types of damage.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Increase the number
of subjects the spell protects, usually by increasing the area of
effect. (For a lower level, decrease the area of effect, or have the
spell provide protection for only the caster. )</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Increase the number
of opponents whose attack abilities are reduced. Again, this is
usually accomplished by increasing the area of effect. (For a lower
level, decrease the area of effect. )</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Increase the power
of the spell so it eliminates the attacker altogether.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>Does the spell increase or decrease a subject's
saving throw modifier?</I> Penalties and bonuses to the subject's
saving throw alter the effectiveness of a spell. Consider again our
hypothetical 3rd-level <I>flying sword</I> spell. Assume that it
inflicts 1-10 hit points of damage on subjects when used at night,
and that a saving throw negates the damage. If the subject is allowed
a +2 bonus, it might be more appropriate to assign <I>flying sword</I>
to 2nd-level. Conversely, if no saving throw is allowed at all, the
spell might belong at 4th-level.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>Is the effect of the spell permanent?</I> Spells
whose effects are temporary are less powerful than those whose
effects are permanent. (Remember that few spells are literally
permanent, since <I>dispel magic</I> negates their effects in most
cases. A<I> limited wish</I> or <I>wish</I> can negate almost any
spell. )</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>What are the spell's duration, range, and area of effect?</I>
Longer durations, ranges, and areas of effect translate into more
powerful spells. Adjusting these elements is a good way to modify a
spell to assign it to a higher or lower level. For instance, if <I>flying
sword</I> persists for only one round/level and has a range of 30
yards, it belongs in a lower level than if it persisted for one
turn/level and had a range of 100 yards.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">There are no minimum or maximum requirements for
durations, ranges, or areas of effect, as long as the DM stays within
the bounds of reason. For instance, a range of 1 mile/level sounds
ridiculously high for <I>any </I>1st-level spell. A good place to
start for establishing durations, ranges, and areas of effect is 1
round/level (duration), 10 yards/level (range), and a 10-foot cube or
one creature/level (area of effect). Remember that these are general
guidelines only, and are not appropriate for every type of spell.
Many spells have an effective range of 0, meaning they affect only
the caster. Others affect only a touched subject. Those spells whose
effects are permanent until negated have no set duration. For some
spells, such as <I>extension</I>, area of effect is irrelevant.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">When the DM has finished defining the effects of a new
spell and has assigned it to a level, the spell should be compared to
the existing spells of that level. If the new spell is clearly weaker
or excessively more powerful than spells from the same level, the DM
should either assign it to a different level or make adjustments as
suggested above to make it comparable. In general, the illusion and
divination spells are the least powerful, and the necromancy and
invocation spells are the most powerful; a new spell should be
checked against these first.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Let's return to our two new spells for the school of
metamorphics. <I>Evaporation</I> causes a quantity of water or other
inorganic liquid to instantly turn to vapor, just as if the sun had
evaporated it. It will not inflict any direct damage (evaporating the
blood or other organic liquids of a creature is forbidden). <I>Evaporation
</I>is difficult to perceive as providing meaningful defense for a
party. Evaporation is destined to be a low-level spell, probably 1st-level.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Range? Most 1st-level spells have a range of 30-60
yards; since evaporation is relatively weak, we will give it a higher
range of 60 yards.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Area of effect? Most 1st-level spells affect an area
of 10-30 yards (or 10-30 foot-radius, or 10-30 foot cube). In this
case, we will give <I>evaporation</I> an area of effect of a 20-foot
cube + 10-foot cube/level. (This makes the spell more powerful as the
wizard increases in level.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Checking our 1st-level evaporation spell against the
existing 1st-level spells in the <I>PH</I> shows no major
discrepancies. The definition of evaporation still needs more
tightening. We need to determine whether it affects liquids concealed
in containers, rain, quicksand, and lava, and other limitations it has.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Looking at <I>blood to dust</I>, it belongs in a
higher level because it causes death. We will decide that blood to
dust causes all of the blood of a single victim to turn to dust,
instantly killing it. It is certainly not as powerful as a 9th-level
spell (the 9th-level<I> power word, kill</I> can destroy several
creatures at once); let's place it at 7th level and give it a range
of 60 yards (comparable to other 7th-level spells). Checking the
existing 7th-level spells, we discover<I> finger of death</I>, a
spell not unlike<I> blood to dust.</I> <I>Finger of death</I> is more
powerful, since it can destroy any creature, even those without
blood, but it also allows a saving throw. To balance <I>blood to dust</I>
against other 7th-level spells, let's say that victims of <I>blood to dust</I>
are not allowed saving throws. Further, undead, monsters from other
planes, and monsters with more than 4 HD will be immune to <I>blood
to dust.</I> With further adjustments (Can the affected subject be
resurrected or raised? Can the corpse be animated to become a
zombie?), we'll have a powerful but balanced 7th-level spell for the
school of metamorphics</FONT></P>
