This spell attunes the caster to the physical remains of dead beings in the
area of effect. <I>Locate remains</I> will thus easily detect the presence of unburied corpses or corporeal undead
(such as skeletons, zombies, or ghasts), but has no effect on noncorporeal
undead (such as ghosts or spectres). The area of effect extends in a 10’ wide path,
facing the in the caster’s current direction. Scanning in a direction requires
one round, during which time the caster remains motionless in concentration.
<P></P>
<I>Locate remains</I> is mostly unaffected by walls or obstacles, though the area of effect is
decreased (to 10’ + 1’/ level) by more than three feet of solid stone, ten feet of
wood or packed earth, or one inch of metal.
<P></P>
In the most general application, the spell precisely locates any and all
physical remains of individuals in the area of effect, regardless of sex, species,
and undead status. This spell does not impart any knowledge regarding the
identity (or undead nature) of the remains; only the current locations of corpses
within the area of effect are learned. If a personal item or a small fragment of
the deceased individual is available at the time of casting, the spell can be
used to locate the remains of that specific individual. In that case, the spell
does not register the presence of any remains except those of the desired
individual.
<P></P>
Both the general and specific versions of the spell have no effect if cast on
a living creature of any kind. The material component for this spell is either
a small piece of bone from a human cadaver (for the general version) or else an
article of clothing, personal possession, or strand of hair (for the specific
version). This spell is popular in regions with strict burial customs.
