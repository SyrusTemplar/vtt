Now it is time to begin creating your own bard player character. Before you
decide whether he is flippant and cavalier or stately and pondering, whether he
is skilled at playing the lyre and reciting lyrics or spinning tales of
long-lost heroes, first you must generate and record his fundamental character
statistics.
<P></P>
This section includes the basic information needed to generate a bard. The
following information is a comprehensive summary of the Rogue and Bard sections
found in the <I>Player's Handbook</I>. It is assumed that any player using this book is intimately familiar with the<I> Player's Handbook</I>; thus, space is not spent here upon background and role-playing information.
For a general discussion of these topics, refer to the Rogue and Bard sections
found in Chapter 3 of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>. Of course, <I>The Complete Bard's Handbook</I> would hardly be complete without discussing such subjects. Refer to the
&quot;Role-Playing Bards&quot; section of this book for a detailed examination of these topics.
