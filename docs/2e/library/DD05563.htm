<P></P>
This god is the patron of magic in all its forms. At the DM's discretion, he
could be the source of all magical energies used by the world's mages; or, he
could just be the god responsible for teaching the most important spells and
rituals to mortal mages. Either way, he is as beloved of mages as of any other
class of characters.
<P></P>
Priests of this god, in addition to encouraging worship of the god, act as
scholars of magic. They help preserve libraries of magical information and
encourage correspondence and the exchange of ideas (and spells) between mages.
<P></P>
Every school of magic or priest sphere of influence could have its own, lesser
god: There could be a god of Necromancy, a god of Enchantment, etc.

Gods of magic are as likely to be male as female.
