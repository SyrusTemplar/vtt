  The ranger is exceptionally skilled at surviving harsh conditions associated
with his primary terrain. In game terms, the ranger is considered to
automatically have the Survival proficiency in his primary terrain. This skill costs no
proficiency slots. A ranger can spend slots in the Survival proficiency to
acquire survival skills in environments other than his primary terrain.
<P></P>
   The ranger's survival skill helps in the following ways, all of which apply
only in the primary terrain. In certain cases, the DM may require a Survival
check (which is equivalent to an Intelligence check). A ranger rolling less than or
equal to his Intelligence score on 1d20 succeeds in the check.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The ranger knows the basic precautions necessary to enhance the chances of
survival, and can instruct and assist any companions accordingly. For example, a
ranger whose primary terrain is Mountains realizes that physical exertion in
high altitudes may result in headaches and fatigue (due to low air pressure). A
Desert ranger knows that in arid climates, it's better to rest in the still air
than exposed to a strong wind (wind promotes evaporation from the skin,
increasing the degree of dehydration). An Aquatic ranger understands that saltwater
can't be used for drinking. An Arctic ranger realizes that temporary protection
can be had from a bitter wind by tunneling inside a snow drift. This knowledge
doesn't guarantee survival by any means; it merely improves the odds. If the
ranger wonders about any particular piece of information, the DM will decide if
he knows it, requiring a Survival check if necessary.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The ranger can stave off starvation by finding small amounts of food. A
successful Survival check locates enough food to feed himself or one other character.
He can locate food in this way once per day.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The ranger can find enough water to keep himself or another character alive
for one day by making a successful Survival check. This assumes that the water is
there to be found.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The ranger can interpret subtle changes in the environment to anticipate
natural disasters. A Plains ranger can recognize the appearance of the sky
associated with a coming tornado. A Mountain ranger can identify the rumbling sound that
precedes an avalanche. The DM may require Survival checks to verify a ranger's
interpretations.

<B>Optional Rule:</B> One way in which a DM can use the Survival ability in a &quot;quick-and-dirty&quot;
fashion is to set up special penalties (cumulative penalties for fatigue for
fatigue or exposure) in especially harsh climes. A party with a ranger or one that
is properly prepared and outfitted, simply avoids the potential penalties.
Those who are unprepared take the penalties until the DM decides they have
acclimated to the setting, or until they take other appropriate actions determined by
the DM.
