</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Animate (Object): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The spell causes inanimate objects—not dead creatures—to move. The object’s
shape and general physical characteristics are not changed. At base difficulty
(25), the spell causes an object weighing 50 pounds or less to move at a speed of
12 over normal surfaces. The spell is often combined with a transport spell to
improve the object’s movement rate.
<P></P>
If directed to fight, an animated object can strike once a round using the
caster’s THAC0 (see the notes to <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01334.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01334.htm.php.html">Table 30</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> for damage ratings). An animated object can be imbued with an improved THAC0
or the ability to make extra attacks.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Destroy: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The magic wrecks inanimate objects. At base difficulty (45), the target object
is smashed or crumpled; the object cannot be repaired, but it can be remade at
10–60% of its original cost. Doubling the difficulty (90) shatters or
disintegrates the object, destroying it utterly.
<P></P>
Objects in a creature’s possession gain the creature’s saving throw to resist
the effect. Unattended objects must save vs. disintegration or be destroyed.
<P></P>
An object does not have to be totally destroyed to be adversely affected by a
destroy spell. It is possible ruin objects larger than the area of effect by
destroying their key parts, such as disintegrating the arms and legs of an
attacking giant statue.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fortify: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The spell increases the target’s natural potency in some fashion. One of a
character’s ability scores can be enhanced, a beverage might become sweeter, a
rope might become stronger, etc.
<P></P>
At base difficulty (30), the fortified attribute is increased 10% for the
duration of the spell. Doubling the difficulty (60) results in a gain of 10–40%
(1d4x10). Tripling the difficulty (90) results in a gain of 20–60% (2d3x10).
Quadrupling the difficulty (120) results in a gain of 30–120% (3d4x10). Each
additional multiple of the base difficulty adds another 1d4x10% gain.
<P></P>
If used to enhance an ability score, each 10% gain equals a +1 bonus if the
enhanced score is 15 or less. If the score being enhanced is 16 or higher, each
100% gain equals a +1 bonus. An ability score cannot be fortified beyond the
recipient’s racial maximum unless the fortify is combined with an imbue spell.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Transform: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The spell changes the target’s form or nature. An object’s shape might change
or the object might become another object altogether. A creature might grow
extra limbs or become an entirely different creature. A transformation spell
cannot affect a single object weighing more than 50 tons.
<P></P>
At base difficulty (35), an object can be bent or shaped into a new form for
the duration of the spell. The object does not break, but it is most likely
rendered useless for its original purpose. Some examples include shaping a sword
into a very thin shield, changing a dagger into a candelabra, or blunting the
tips of arrows to make them useless.
<P></P>
Doubling the difficulty (70) allows the spell to transform a living creature
(similar to a <I>polymorph other </I>spell) or change one type of material into another similar material. For
example, leather could be changed into wood, a fire giant could be transformed into
a rust monster, or a section of a castle’s stone wall could be changed into
iron. This form of the spell can also purify tainted food and water.
<P></P>
Tripling the difficulty (105) allows the caster to transform a creature into
an object (similar to a <I>polymorph any object </I>spell) or change one type of material into a wholly different type of material
of approximately the same value. Wood can be converted into glass, a fire
giant changed into a small catapult, or emeralds can be converted into rubies or
star sapphires. A material can be transformed into a more valuable material if
the transformation is combined with an imbue spell.
<P></P>
A simple transformation spell—one not combined with another type of spell—can
be made permanent without the loss of a point of Constitution if the material
transformed is not magical.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Transport: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The spell enhances a creature’s movement abilities. The recipient can move
faster, acquire a new mode of movement, or travel instantaneously.
<P></P>
At base difficulty (35), the recipient’s normal movement rate increases by 12
or the recipient receives a new mode of travel for the duration of the spell.
For example, a land-based recipient could fly or swim at a rate of 12, burrow
through normal ground or jump at a rate of 3, or move across difficult terrain
(webs, treetops, quicksand, etc.) at a rate of 6.
<P></P>
Doubling the difficulty (70) doubles the speed bestowed or allows
extraordinary movement at a rate of 3. A character could walk on water, burrow through
solid rock or ice, or travel through difficult terrain at a movement rate of 6.
<P></P>
Tripling the difficulty (105) allows teleportation with no chance for error,
but the distance teleported increases the difficulty (use <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01335.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD01335.htm.php.html">Table 31</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> on page 131 to determine the modifier). Teleportation has an instantaneous
duration. The caster could also increase movement over difficult or extraordinary
terrain by 3.
