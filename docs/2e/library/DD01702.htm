</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> To get out of a combat, characters can make a careful withdrawal or they can
simply flee.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Withdrawing:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When making a withdrawal, a character carefully backs away from his opponent
(who can choose to follow). The character moves up to 1/3 his normal movement
rate.
<P></P>
If two characters are fighting a single opponent and one of them decides to
withdraw, the remaining character can block the advance of the opponent. This is
a useful method for getting a seriously injured man out of a combat.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fleeing:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">To flee from combat, a character simply turns and runs up to his full movement
rate. However, the fleeing character drops his defenses and turns his back to
his opponent.
<P></P>
The enemy is allowed a free attack (or multiple attacks if the creature has
several attacks per round) at the rear of the fleeing character. This attack is
made the instant the character flees: It doesn't count against the number of
attacks that opponent is allowed during the round, and initiative is irrelevant.
<P></P>
The fleeing character can be pursued, unless a companion blocks the advance of
the enemy.
