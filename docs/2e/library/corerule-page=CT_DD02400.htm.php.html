Before a battle begins, one or both sides may have to check for surprise. The
Dungeon Master has the final word on whether or not a surprise check applies.
There are situations in which one side may have to make a surprise check but
their opponents don’t—for example, an ambush or a nighttime encounter with enemies
carrying bright lights. Surprise conditions and modifiers are discussed
extensively in the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00559.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00559.htm.php.html">DMG</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> and the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01757.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01757.htm.php.html">PHB</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> (Chapter 11: Encounters for both).

The surprise check is a d10 roll, modified for the surrounding conditions and
any special preparations one party or the other makes. Normally, a group is
surprised on a roll of 1, 2, or 3. The surprisers get a free round of attacks,
movement, or spells against the surprised members of the other group.
