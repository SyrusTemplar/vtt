<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Merchants</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Merchants are vital to any civilization, for they buy, sell, or barter the
goods and services that a society demands. Merchants include local fish-mongers,
street vendors, shop keepers, caravan owners, and more. Some have permanent
stores established in a thriving business district. Others travel to distant
lands to bring back rare treasures. Adventurers are natural merchants, as they
often visit many strange and exotic places and acquire unusual and valuable goods.
Merchant adventurers have an outlet to sell many of the material treasures such
as tapestries, statuary, gems, and jewelry they often accumulate.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Merchants can wield any weapons appropriate to their classes. However, a
merchant who wears heavy armor and carries several large weapons might make their
customers nervous?unless the merchant is in the business of selling arms and
armor.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended nonweapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Appraising, carpentry, cobbling, etiquette, reading/writing, modern
languages, local history, forgery, tailoring, weaving.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Equipment:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Merchants can carry whatever equipment they desire, however much of it should
be useful in their trade. Many merchants make sure they have plenty of leather
sacks and other containers to store goods they might acquire. They prize <I>bags of holding</I> and <I>flatboxes</I>.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended traits:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Glibness, keen senses, precise memory, alertness, obscure knowledge.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Benefits:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Because they are often welcomed into communities, merchants receive a +1
reaction roll bonus in city settings. In addition, merchants with the appraising
proficiency gain a permanent +2 bonus to that skill.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hindrances:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> While they are initially welcomed for the goods and services they bring, not
all merchants are forthright in their business dealings. Any merchant who is
publicly accused of cheating his customers (whether the accusation is true),
loses the reaction bonus above. Further, he suffers a ?2 penalty to all reaction
rolls until his innocence is proven.
