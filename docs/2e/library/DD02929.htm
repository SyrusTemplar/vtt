The next step in creating a Player’s Option hero is choosing a vocation. There
are four basic types of characters in the AD&amp;D game: warriors, wizards,
priests, and rogues.
<P></P>
Each character receives a number of points to spend on class abilities. That
means priests of the same faith no longer are carbon copies of each other.
Warriors can have widely varying skills. Characters are limited only by their
players’ imaginations.
<P></P>
Character points are used to purchase skills, and the number of points
available vary with classes.
<P></P>
Character classes share common terminology. Three of the most-used terms are:
<P></P>
<A NAME="e981f044"></A><B>Experience points</B>—the measure of a character’s learning. They are awarded by the DM after each
adventure in response to a character’s actions and accomplishments. When a
character gains enough experience points, he advances a level and his abilities
improve.
<P></P>
<A NAME="1aec2102"></A><B>Level</B>—refers to the stage of the character’s development in his class. A beginning
character is first level. When the character earns enough experience points, he
advances to second, then third, and so on. Different classes advance at
different rates.
<P></P>
<A NAME="838e3af5"></A><B>Prime requisite</B>—is the term that refers to the ability score most important to a particular
class. For example, Strength is the prime requisite for fighters. A character
needs to meet all ability score and prime requisite requirements to become a
member of a certain class. Some classes have more than one prime requisite. Any
character with a prime requisite score of 16 or greater receives an extra 10%
bonus to experience point awards.
