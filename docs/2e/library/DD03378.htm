</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The wizard may well be the most important character class in the AD&amp;D game.
Whether or not a particular player character wizard is the most powerful member
of a party, it seems that <I>every </I>AD&amp;D campaign has at least one great archmage or master wizard who holds
supreme power. Wizards are responsible for the creation of all kinds of adventures
and works of magic that other characters later become entangled in or discover.
In many adventures, the party’s wizard is the <I>only </I>character who can use his magic to provide a means to cross a barrier or solve
a riddle. In fact, in some cases, the only way to resolve the entire adventure
or quest is through the inventive use of the wizard’s spell arsenal.
<P></P>
Given this fact, it only makes sense to begin an examination of magic in the
AD&amp;D game with a thorough look at the wizard character class. In this chapter,
we’ll examine all the varieties of mages and specialist wizards available to a
player character. Several new varieties of specialist wizards are also described
in this chapter. In addition to a long look at the existing wizard classes,
we’ll also present a point-based character design system that will allow a player
to select his wizard’s abilities and limitations in order to customize his own
character. This system is an expansion of the character class rules from <I>Player’s Option: <A HREF="SP_DD02958.htm"></A></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="SP_DD02958.htm">Skills &amp; Powers </A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>, although you don’t need that book in order to use this material.

In other words, if you have this book, you should use the rules presented
here when creating your wizard character. However, there is one notable exception
to this case—if you are using an AD&amp;D campaign setting that includes its own
rules on character generation, such as the Dark Sun or Al-Qadim® game settings,
you should continue to create wizards for those settings using the appropriate
rules.
