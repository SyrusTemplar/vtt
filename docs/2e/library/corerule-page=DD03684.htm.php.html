This spell conjures a coherent pseudopod of water from any suitable body of
water at least 5 feet across and 2 feet deep (for streams) or 10 feet in diameter
and 2 feet deep (for ponds or pools). The pseudopod can stretch up to 10 feet
plus 1 foot per caster level from its source, so a 3rd-level priest could
command <I>watery fist </I>to strike at a creature hovering thirteen feet above a lake or standing on the
shore 13 feet from the water. The pseudopod obeys the priest’s mental
commands, although the priest must concentrate each round in order to maintain control
of the watery member.
<P></P>
The pseudopod is incapable of fine manipulation, but it can be used to make
bludgeoning or constricting attacks. When used to strike at opponents, it attacks
with the caster’s THAC0 and inflicts damage as shown below. The priest may add
his magical attack adjustment (from his Wisdom score) to his THAC0, but
Strength-based adjustments or special weapon skills don’t help the priest to control <I>watery fist</I>. The pseudopod may be able to make rear or flank attacks if the priest can
direct it into the proper position.
<P></P>
If used to encircle and constrict, the pseudopod must first make an attack
roll as described above, inflicting damage based on the priest’s level. However,
in following rounds, the pseudopod automatically strikes its grappled target for
constricting damage, +1 point per round of constricting. In other words, in
the first round the victim sustains listed damage, in the second round he
sustains listed damage +1, in the third he sustains listed damage +2, and so on. The
pseudopod holds its target with an effective Strength equal to the priest’s
Wisdom score.

<I>Watery fist </I>can be released by the priest any time he cares to stop concentrating on
maintaining it. The pseudopod immediately resumes its normal state, possibly
drenching a grappled creature or extinguishing a small fire if the caster wishes. The
pseudopod is AC 6 and has 15 hp plus 1 hp per caster level, but it can only be
damaged by magical weapons, fire, or cold; all other attacks simply pass
through the water. <I>Transmute water to dust, part water, lower water, </I>and <I>Otiluke’s freezing sphere </I>all destroy <I>watery fist </I>on contact.
<P></P>
The material component is a vial full of blessed water or a sprig of mistletoe
that is thrown onto the body of water from which the fist will be summoned.
