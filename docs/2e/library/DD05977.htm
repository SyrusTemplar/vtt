This very simple instrument is usually a small diamond set into a suitable
handle, or even one set into a ring. The diamond must be cut to a fine point, and
if used in a ring a hinged top should be used to protect the gem. Such a tool
will cut through glass fairly quickly. Attempting an entry through a window is
always superior in principle to attempting to force a door, since windows cannot
be as physically tough as doors and are less likely to be locked; but if they
are locked, a glass cutter is highly useful.

The efficiency of this item is considerably increased if used together with
Tar Paper (see below).
