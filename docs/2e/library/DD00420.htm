AD&amp;D game combat does not use a hit location system to determine where every
blow in a battle has landed. Sometimes, however, characters and creatures will
find it necessary to aim their blows at an exact point. A fighter may want to
smash a vial held in the evil wizard's hand; a thief might attempt to shoot the
jeweled eye out of an idol with his crossbow. These are cases where the
character is attempting a &quot;called shot.&quot;
