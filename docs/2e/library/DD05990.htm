This is usually a small metal pot about the size of a night-light candle. It
has a hinged flip-up lid with a mirror on the inside; a silver mirror is often
used, so the item is not cheap. The mirror directs the light, and the lid also
works as a snuffer when closed. The lamp provides enough light for the thief to
work by (e.g., when trying to pick a lock in a dark place), while not shedding
enough to give the thief away (hopefully). Certainly, the dim, focused light is
unlikely to be visible at all further than some 20 feet from the thief, and
even within this range it is very, very dim.
