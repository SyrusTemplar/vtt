Greek fire is an alchemical mixture that readily bursts into flame and burns
furiously. A Greek fire projector is a metal tube about six inches wide and five
feet long. When uncapped, it acts like a flame thrower, spraying a line of
flame one square wide and four squares long. The line begins at the projector’s
mouth and extends directly away. Creatures within the area immediately suffer
3d10 points of damage unless they roll a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon
for half of that. Targets suffer an additional 1d10 points of damage during
the next two rounds, regardless of the initial saving throw’s result.
