<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Defiled and Cursed Groves</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Some sacred groves tell a tragic story: Their plants
have been dug up, trees burned or chopped down, water sources fouled,
or standing stones overturned and broken. Perhaps their clearings
once served as altars to other priests in the worship of strange
gods. Such groves have been defiled, stripped of all their powers
until druids reclaim them (described below).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Other events may result in a still worse fate--a grove
becoming cursed. For instance:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> A terrible event
takes place within the grove's boundaries: Someone reads a cursed
scroll, a deity's avatar passes through, a druid dies violently, or
another highly charged event takes place.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> The grove is
deliberately defiled but not destroyed. When plants begin to grow
back, the grove may retain some twisted vestige of its original power.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> If the druid who
sanctified the grove strays badly from the neutral alignment,
abandons the Order, or takes up the path of the Lost Druids, the
grove's beauty and powers may become warped--perhaps as a warning to
the erring steward.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">To determine what curse has struck a particular sacred
grove, the DM may roll on Table 5. A druid who discovers a cursed
grove nearly always tries to find a way to lift the curse and
ultimately resanctify the land. Some typical curses are described below.</FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Entrancing. </B>This curse can apply to any grove
containing a source of water or plants bearing fruit, nuts, or
berries. Those who eat natural fruits of the grove or drink its water
must save vs. spell or become charmed: They refuse to leave the
grove, claiming they must defend this beautiful place. They resist
forcefully if anyone tries to harm the grove or take them from it.
The charm is broken if those it has entranced leave the grove, or it
can wear off, per the <I>charm person</I> spell.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Poisoned Ground. </B>A terrible poison lives within
the ground, although the plants in the grove are immune. Those who
touch the vegetation (including grass) with bare skin must save vs.
poison each round of contact or suffer 1d6 points of damage.
Characters who eat fruits, etc., from the grove must save vs. poison
or die.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Haunted.</B> The life forces of people who die in a
haunted grove or within a mile of its boundaries are drawn into one
of the grove's trees or standing stones. The trunks of the trees or
the surfaces of the stones contain twisted images of the dead trapped
within. While trapped, these souls cannot be raised, resurrected, or reincarnated.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">To defend itself, the grove can summon any of its
prisoners' spirits as ghosts or banshees (described in the <I>Monstrous
Manual &#153;</I>). Each summoning takes two rounds, but only one
ghost or banshee can exist at any time. Resanctifying the grove
(described below) ends the curse and frees the trapped spirits, who
now may be reincarnated, raised, or resurrected. Destroying the grove
before resanctifying releases all the trapped spirits as malevolent
ghosts or banshees to haunt the region henceforth.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Perpetual Season.</B> The grove, locked into a
single season, never experiences a change in climate. Though a grove
locked into winter isn't ever popular, a grove of perpetual spring or
summer may seem like a blessing. While winter blizzards rage outside,
the day is warm and sunny within a grove of perpetual summer; grass
is always green, trees always leafy, and flowers ever blossoming.
Nevertheless, druids consider this redundant setting horribly unnatural.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Hungry Trees.</B> The trees in this grove have been
animated by a hunger for flesh. Treat the 2d8 hungry trees of this
cursed grove as evil treants. Masquerading as normal trees, they
suddenly attack anyone entering the grove. They never cross its
borders unless attacked from outside the grove, though; in that case,
they re-enter the grove after defeating (and consuming) foes.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Reclaiming Cursed or Defiled Groves</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Druids whose sacred grove becomes defiled or destroyed
must perform a ritual of atonement, plus find and punish the guilty
party. Failing deprives druids of all granted powers and major access
to priestly spheres.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The first step in reclaiming a defiled grove involves
repairing any damage it has sustained: planting new trees, restoring
damaged standing stones, and so on. Then, a druid must perform an
uninterrupted daylong ceremony within the grove to ask for the
renewed blessings of Nature.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Reclaiming a cursed grove poses additional
difficulties. After performing the above steps, the druid must
complete a task to balance the forces behind the curse. The nature of
the task is up to the DM, but it usually involves a dangerous quest
in a real or symbolic attempt to &quot;undo&quot; the curse, punish
those who caused it, or make amends for the act that led to it. After
concluding the task, the druid must return to the grove to invoke
Nature and cast a <I>remove curse</I> spell.</FONT></P>
