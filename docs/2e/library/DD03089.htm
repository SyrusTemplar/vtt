<A NAME="9acd9be3"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Allure:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This trait allows a character to attract romantic attention from NPCs, at the
player-s option. The character can conceal the trait any time, but when it is
in effect it can modify the reaction rolls of NPCs who might be
affected-perhaps by as much as +3. The trait is only effective if there is a reasonable chance
of the PC drawing romantic attention from the NPC-at the very least the NPC
must be of the opposite sex and of at least young adult age.
<P></P>
A character with the allure trait can receive one henchman above the normal
maximum-if at least one of the henchmen has a romantic interest, however
unrequited and hopeless, with the player character. Elves can purchase this trait for 1
less character point than the listed amount.
