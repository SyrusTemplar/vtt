<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">There are swordsmen, and then there are swordsmen. A warrior who devotes his
life to the study of martial combat and the characteristics of a single type of
weapon can become a weapon master-a fighter whose precision, quickness, and
skill are virtually unequaled anywhere.
<P></P>
Weapon masters are rare characters. Only single-classed fighters can ever
achieve weapon mastery, and even then they do so with time, study, and sacrifice.
To achieve mastery in a weapon, a character must first specialize in the use of
that weapon. Then, at any time after he reaches 5th level, he can spend another
proficiency slot to become a weapon master. He can continue to devote
proficiency slots to the study of his chosen weapon, but can-t progress faster than the
rate at which he gains new weapon proficiency slots. So, a character who
becomes a master at 5th level couldn-t acquire his second slot of mastery until 6th
level, his third until 9th level, and so on.
<P></P>
Generally, only weapons that require some skill to handle or that have a
history of cultural identification are chosen by weapon masters. Swords of any kind
are the most common weapons mastered, followed by bows and then axes or spears.
Polearms, crossbows, and firearms are the subject of weapon mastery only in
rare cases. The DM can decide that a weapon isn-t appropriate for mastery at his
discretion, but he should do so before a character chooses to specialize in it.
