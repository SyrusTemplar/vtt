</B> Priests </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">High-level priests combine spellcasting abilities with combat power. Like
warriors, priests equipped with magical armor and weapons are formidable in combat.
Their primary strength, however, comes from their spells.
<P></P>
In addition, priests receive extra proficiencies and hit points through 30th
level. Priests also have access to special skills beginning at 10th level.

All priests, even druids, gain the ability to cast true dweomers when they
reach 20th level. (Although druids do not gain additional spells of levels 1–7
once they exceed 15th level, true dweomers represent a new approach to magic that
very high-level druids can understand and use.) Note that the term “10th-level
spell” is something of a misnomer. For a priest, a true dweomer might be called
an 8th-level spell, but a true dweomer cast by a priest functions just like a
wizard’s true dweomer does.
<P></P>
Unlike wizards, priests use divine power to create their true dweomers, and
any true dweomer a priest casts must promote the deity’s interests in some way.
This requires a judgment call for the DM. When deciding if a priest’s deity
grants a true dweomer, consider the following:
<P></P>
<P></P>
The priest must be in good standing with the deity, having observed the
requirements of both the character’s alignment and the deity’s ethos. This is true
of all priest spells, and a priest who has strayed too far from the path might
not be able to cast any spells at all.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Any true dweomer that impacts on the deity’s sphere of control or portfolio
is likely to be granted unless it runs contrary to that power’s wishes. For
example, a deity of agriculture is likely to grant a true dweomer that creates an
abundant harvest unless the people who are going to benefit from the harvest
have offended the deity. Similarly, a deity of war is very likely to grant a true
dweomer that transports an entire army to a battlefield, whereas a deity of
peace would be more likely to help transport troops away from a battle. The DM
should always try to consider the problem from the deity’s point of view.
<P></P>
<P></P>
When in doubt, check the spheres of normal spells the priest is allowed to
cast. If the proposed true dweomer contains effects found in those spells, it is
probably acceptable. For example, a priest with access to the creation sphere
probably can use true dweomers from the create, conjure, and animate areas.
