Collateral Spell Effects </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Everyone knows that a <I>fireball</I> does 1d6 damage per level of the caster, but have you ever stopped to
consider what else a ball of flame 40 feet across might do? First of all, a <I>fireball </I>will start a lot of fires, especially in medieval settings with thatch-roofed
houses, garments redolent with animal oils and tanning chemicals, and lots of
wooden construction. Secondly, the residual fires left by a <I>fireball </I>will produce smoke-probably a lot of it, as many fires smoke very heavily just
when they-re getting started. Next, a <I>fireball </I>may foul the air of a confined space by consuming a great amount of the
available oxygen. But, for most players and DMs, the same fireball did 17 points of
damage, and that was it!
<P></P>
In this section, we-ll take a quick look at unusual effects that may accompany
the use of many powerful spells. In military terms, these incidental effects
are referred to as collateral damage-a PC wizard probably isn-t trying to start
a three-alarm fire when he torches a city guard with his <I>burning hands </I>spell, but it might happen anyway. Depending on the DM-s mischievousness, all
kinds of mayhem may break loose when wizards start throwing heavy-damage spells
around.
<P></P>
The most important characteristic of a spell for purposes of collateral
effects is its general type and purpose. There isn-t a whole lot of fallout from a <I>charm person </I>or <I>magic missile </I>spell, but many other spells create environmental effects that may be
long-lasting or even permanent.
