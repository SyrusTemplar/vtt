<A NAME="3a913dfc"></A><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Riding, Land-Based:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Those skilled in land riding are proficient in the art of riding and handling
horses or other types of ground mounts. When the proficiency slot is filled,
the character must declare which type of mount he is proficient in. Possibilities
include griffons, unicorns, dire wolves, and virtually any creatures used as
mounts by humans, demihumans, or humanoids.
<P></P>
A character with riding proficiency can perform all of the following feats.
Some of them are automatic, while others require a proficiency check for success.
<P></P>
? The character can vault onto a saddle whenever the horse or other mount is
standing still, even when the character is wearing armor. This does not require
a proficiency check. The character must make a check, however, if he wishes to
get the mount moving during the same round in which he lands in its saddle. He
must also make a proficiency check if he attempts to vault onto the saddle of a
moving mount. Failure indicates that the character falls to the
ground--presumably quite embarrassed.
<P></P>
? The character can urge the mount to jump tall obstacles or leap across gaps.
No check is required if the obstacle is less than three feet tall or the gap
is less than 12 feet wide. If the character wants to roll a proficiency check,
the mount can be urged to leap obstacles up to seven feet high, or jump across
gaps up to 30 feet wide. Success means that the mount has made the jump. Failure
indicates that it balks, and the character must make another proficiency check
to see whether he retains his seat or falls to the ground.
<P></P>
? The character can spur his steed on to great speeds, adding 6 feet per round
to the animal's movement rate for up to four turns. This requires a
proficiency check each turn to see if the mount can be pushed this hard. If the initial
check fails, no further attempts may be made, but the mount can move normally.
If the second or subsequent check fails, the mount immediately slows to a walk,
and the character must dismount and lead the animal for a turn. In any event,
after four turns of racing, the steed must be walked by its dismounted rider for
one turn.
<P></P>
? The character can guide his mount with his knees, enabling him to use
weapons that require two hands (such as bows and two-handed swords) while mounted.
This feat does not require a proficiency check unless the character takes damage
while so riding. In this case, a check is required and failure means that the
character falls to the ground and sustains an additional 1d6 points of damage.
<P></P>
? The character can drop down and hang alongside the steed, using it as a
shield against attack. The character cannot make an attack or wear armor while
performing this feat. The character's Armor Class is lowered by 6 while this
maneuver is performed. Any attacks that would have struck the character's normal
Armor Class are considered to have struck the mount instead. No proficiency check
is required.
<P></P>
? The character can leap from the back of his steed to the ground and make a
melee attack against any character or creature within 10 feet. The player must
roll a successful proficiency check with a -4 penalty to succeed. On a failed
roll, the character fails to land on his feet, falls clumsily to the ground, and
suffers 1d3 points of damage.
