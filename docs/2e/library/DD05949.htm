This is simply a cloth sling; the thief wears it to appear as if he has a
broken or injured arm, and speedily withdraws his hand from it for the
pocket-picking attempt.
<P></P>
This actually reduces the chances of picking pockets by 5%, but the payoff is
that the chances for being discovered are halved (but a natural 00 on d100
always means discovery). This reflects the fact that people simply do not expect to
see a man with a broken arm picking pockets and the expectation determines the
perception. The use of this unusual strategy is only useful?but it is really
useful here?when the priority is not to be discovered, rather than to be sure of
success. A thief working in a city where he is not a guild member, or one
where legal penalties for picking pockets are very harsh, might favor the use of
this ruse.
<P></P>
A thief obviously cannot use this ruse for an extended period of time in the
same place (save possibly by posing as a beggar). There is a limit to how long
an arm can plausibly need for healing, after all.
