<TITLE>Horn of Valor-- Miscellaneous Magic (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Horn of Valor:</B> This golden horn is indistinguishable from any other magical horn until it is
sounded. When sounded, each unit hearing it who is allied with or loyal to the
character sounding the horn gains the following benefits. First, the unit
gains a +2 bonus to its morale for 1d4 BATTLESYSTEMâ„¢ rules turns. Second, any
routed friendly unit who hears it immediately makes a rally check with a bonus of 2
to its morale (for that check only). (This check is made when the horn is
sounded--during the magic phase--rather than in the rally phase. If this additional
check is failed, the unit is entitled to a second check in the rally phase, as
normal.)
<P></P>
Enemy units who hear the horn are also affected: they suffer a -1 penalty to
morale for 1d2 BATTLESYSTEM rules turns.
<P></P>
Under normal conditions, the sound of the horn can be heard at a range of 24&quot;.
Unusual conditions, such as a raging storm, can decrease this range, but the
horn can <I>always</I> be heard at a range of 9&quot; (unless the character blowing the horn is within an
area of magical <I>silence</I>, of course).
<P></P>
The horn of valor can be sounded only once per BATTLESYSTEM Rules turn, and no
more than three times in any 12 hour period. If blown a fourth time within
this period, it becomes totally nonmagical for 1d6 days, and any effects remaining
from earlier soundings immediately terminate. Effects from multiple soundings
are not cumulative. (Instantaneous effects such as the automatic rally check
for friendly units take place each time the horn is sounded.)
