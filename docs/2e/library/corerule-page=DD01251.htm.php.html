The creature has a breath attack it can use three to five times each day.
Typically, the creature must wait one or two rounds between breaths. The creature
can move normally during a round when it breathes, but it cannot make melee
attacks, cast a spell, or use a spell-like power.

The breath weapon can take any form the DM desires: a cloud of scalding steam,
cone of searing flame, gout of acid, petrifying mist, and so on. A quick look

of the creature. For example, a paragon dragon turtle has 39 hit dice and has
a breath weapon that inflicts an average of 175 points of damage. For all
damage-causing breath weapons, a successful saving throw versus breath weapon
reduces damage by half.
