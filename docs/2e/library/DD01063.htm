<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Tome of Clear Thought:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A work of this nature is indistinguishable from any normal book. Any single
character who reads a <I>tome of clear thought</I> will be able to practice mental exercises that will increase his Intelligence
by one point. Reading a work of this nature takes 48 hours time over six days,
and immediately thereafter the book disappears.
<P></P>
The reader must begin a program of concentration and mental discipline within
one week of reading the tome. After a month of such exercise, Intelligence goes
up. The knowledge gained from reading the work can never be recorded or
articulated. Any further perusal of a <I>tome of clear thought</I> will be of no benefit to the character.
