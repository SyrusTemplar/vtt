<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Fur of Warmth</B>: These large, white furs (5' by 8') are reportedly taken from the skins of
creatures native to the para-elemental plane of Ice. A person wearing the fur
still feels cold in a cold environment (such as the para-elemental plane of ice),
but does not suffer damage from exposure.
<P></P>
Anyone wrapped in the fur is immune to the natural effects of cold, including
the environments of the inner planes. Anyone wearing the fur takes half-damage
from coldbased attacks. The wearer need not be covered completely by the fur to
receive the enchanted protection; the fur must simply be draped over him like
a cape. If the fur is cut into more than one piece, it loses its magical
property.
<P></P>
If the fur is worn in pleasant or hot weather, it affects the wearer as any
other large fur would. <B>
