This spell is a deeper and more intense version of <I>telepathy</I>. It allows the priest to communicate silently and instantly with a single
willing subject. Participants may share deeper thoughts than with <I>telepathy</I>, including emotions and memories. Each participant sees, hears, and otherwise
senses everything experienced by the other, although such vicarious
experiences feel diluted and cannot be mistaken for direct sensations.
<P></P>
The participants can quickly share such personal concepts as plans, hopes, and
fears, but they <I>cannot</I> share skills or spells. Thus, it is impossible to communicate the procedure
for casting a particular spell or for picking a lock.
<P></P>
Communication through <I>rapport</I> is approximately 15 times faster than verbal communication. As with <I>telepathy</I>, the priest can establish separate &quot;channels&quot; to multiple individuals; each
such linkage costs one casting of the spell. There is no &quot;crosstalk&quot; between the
channels, however.
<P></P>
<I>Rapport</I> cannot be used on unwilling subjects.
