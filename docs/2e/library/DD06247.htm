With this spell, the caster can force any shapechanger or magic-wielder using
any form of a <I>shapechanging</I> spell to instantly revert to his true form (or his most common form). To use
the spell, the caster points at creatures he knows or believes to be
shapechangers. If the creatures are indeed shapechangers, they must make a successful
saving throw or immediately revert to their true form and suffer 3-30 (3d10) hit
points of damage from the wracking pain caused by the forced change. The change
takes a full round, during which time a victim can take no other actions. If
the saving throw was successful, the victim does not change form, but still
suffers half damage (2d10/2).
<P></P>
The material components for this spell are a hair from the hide of any
lycanthrope and a live butterfly, released when the verbal component is uttered.

<I>Know value</I> enables the caster to know the total value of all coins, gems, and jewelry
within the area of effect, within the limits that follow.

in a chest, or buried in the ground. The items must also be contained within an
area no larger than a 10-foot cube, and this area can be no farther than 10
yards from the caster.
<P></P>
Further, <I>know value</I> will only reveal the value of 75% of the total number of objects in a
treasure pile, up to a maximum of 10 pieces; the DM determines which pieces the spell
affects, and the caster does not know which particular pieces have been
appraised. The spell does not detect the presence or value of magical items, and it
ignores the value of personal property, such as clothing, weapons, and other
equipment.<I> Know value</I> does not reveal the number or nature of any type of hidden objects.

<P></P>
With this spell, privacy is ensured in a room of up to 1600 square feet (40
feet x 40 feet, or the equivalent). From the outside, the windows of the room
appear to be dark and cloudy, preventing those with normal vision, infravision, or
any other type of vision from seeing inside. Those inside the room can see out
the windows as they normally would. No sounds of any kind can escape from the
room. Scrying attempts, such as <I>ESP, clairaudience, clairvoyance</I>, and <I>crystal balls</I> cannot penetrate the room, and a <I>wizard eye</I> cannot enter. The caster can leave the room without affecting the spell.

opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and a pinch of powdered chrysolite.

Range: Touch
<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>
Duration: 1 round/level
<P></P>
Casting Time: 5
<P></P>
Area of Effect: One victim
<P></P>
Saving Throw: Special
<P></P>
<P></P>
This spell allows the caster to attack with a rotting touch similar to that of
a mummy. If the caster touches a human, demihuman, or humanoid victim, the
victim immediately loses 2-12 (2d6) hit points and is infected with a rotting
disease which is fatal in 1-6 months. For each month the rot progresses, the victim
permanently loses 2 points of Charisma. While infected, the victim recovers
lost hit points at 10 percent of his normal rate.
<P></P>
The rotting disease can be cured only with a <I>cure disease</I> spell; <I>cure wounds</I> has no effect. A <I>regenerate</I> spell will restore damage but will not otherwise affect the course of the
disease. If a victim makes a successful saving throw, he is not infected, but he
still suffers 2-12 hit points of damage.
<P></P>
The material components for this spell are a piece of rotten fruit and a piece
of a mummy's cloth wrapping.

<P></P>
<P></P>
Range: 20 yards
<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>
Duration: 2 turns per level
<P></P>
Casting Time: 1 round
<P></P>
Area of Effect: Two or more creatures
<P></P>
Saving Throw: None
<P></P>
<P></P>
With this spell, the caster forms a telepathic bond between two or more
creatures with Intelligence of 6 or higher. The bond can be established only between
willing creatures who are within 20 yards of each other. The creatures need not
speak the same language to communicate via the bond. The bond can be placed
upon one creature for every three levels of the caster; therefore, a 9th-level
caster can forge a bond among three creatures. The bonded creatures can remain in
mental contact as long as they remain on the same plane of existence. If
either creature enters a different plane, the spell is terminated.
<P></P>
<I>Rary's telepathic bond</I> can be cast only once to affect a single pair of subjects. However, if the
caster is able to cast the spell twice, the same subjects can be affected again.
Example: A wizard can cast <I>telepathic bond</I> twice. The first casting links Subject A to Subject B. The second casting can
affect Subject A again, linking him with Subject C.
<P></P>
The material components for this spell are two pieces of eggshell; the pieces
must be from the eggs of two different species of egg-laying creature.

Range: 10 yards
<P></P>
Components: V, M
<P></P>
Duration: 1 round/level
<P></P>
Casting Time: 3
<P></P>
Area of Effect: One creature
<P></P>
Saving Throw: 1/2
<P></P>
<P></P>
This spell causes the bones of the affected creature to throb and pulsate
inside his body. The spell can be cast upon any single living creature or person
within the caster's range, providing the creature has a physical form and has
bones inside its body; for instance, <I>throbbing bones</I> will not affect insects, ghosts, or worms.
<P></P>
For the duration of the spell, the affected creature's AC is worsened by 2,
its movement rate is halved, and all its attacks are made with a -2 penalty.
Additionally, it suffers 1-4 hit points of damage per round; this damage is halved
if the creature makes a successful saving throw. However, a successful saving
throw has no affect on the movement, attack, and AC penalties.
<P></P>
The material components for this spell are both pieces of a small bone that
has been snapped in half

<P></P>
Range: 60 yards

<P></P>

<P></P>
Saving Throw: None
<P></P>
<P></P>
This spell causes a <I>wall of bones</I> to erupt from the earth in whatever shape the caster desires within the
limits of the area of effect. The wall is a random construction of bones from many
types of creatures. The wall need not be vertical, but it must rest upon a firm
foundation or it will collapse. Since the wall has many small openings and
gaps, it provides only 50 percent cover. Missiles can easily be fired from behind
the wall, and creatures of small size (less than 4 feet tall) can wriggle
through openings in the wall at the rate of 10 feet per round. However, the wall has
many sharp edges and creatures wriggling through it suffer 1-8 hit points of
damage per 10 feet traveled.
<P></P>
If the spell is cast in an area occupied by creatures, the <I>wall of bones</I> appears everywhere except where the creatures stand. Creatures in the
affected area suffer an immediate 2-16 (2d8) hit points of damage when the wall
appears. The wall can be smashed by creatures wielding blunt weapons with a Strength
of 18 or greater. Every 10 hit points of damage causes a 5 foot x 5 foot x 6
inch section of the wall to collapse. The<I> wall of bones </I>is unaffected by<I> animate dead</I>.
<P></P>
The material component for this spell is the branch of a withered tree taken
from a cemetery
