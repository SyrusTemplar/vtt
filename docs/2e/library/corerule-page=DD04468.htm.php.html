<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Candle of Propitiousness:</B> This candle enhances attacks against a particular enemy within a defined
area. The user lights the candle while speaking the exact name of a single foe. If
the exact name is not known, the user must precisely identify the foe; saying,
&quot;the evil warrior&quot; isn't precise enough, but stating, &quot;the evil warrior who
rules the village of Fair Meadows and carries a golden shield&quot; is sufficient.
<P></P>
All characters who remain within a 50-foot-radius of the lighted candle
receive a +2 bonus to all attack rolls made against the stated foe, regardless of
whether the foe is within 50 feet of the candle. Characters who venture outside
the area of effect lose the bonus. When the stated foe is within the area of
effect, he suffers a -1 penalty to all his attack rolls.
<P></P>
There can be no interposing surfaces such as walls or doors between the <I>candle of propitiousness</I> and characters whom it affects. The stated foe is not allowed a saving throw
to resist the effects of the candle.
<P></P>
The <I>candle of propitiousness</I> burns for up to one hour. If it is moved after it has been lit, its magic is
immediately and permanently negated. Likewise, if its flame is extinguished,
its magic immediately ends. Any magical or natural force capable of extinguishing
a normal flame, such as a <I>gust of wind</I> or a splash of water, can extinguish a <I>candle of propitiousness</I>.
<P></P>
A <I>candle of propitiousness</I> can be lit and used only once.
