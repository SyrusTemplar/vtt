are fairly common. Diviners concentrate on spells that reveal or relay
information, and information can be a weapon far more dangerous than the sharpest
sword. Divination requires patience and insight; a wizard must have a Wisdom
(Wisdom/Intuition) of 16 or better to be a diviner. Divination is opposed by
conjuration/ summoning.
<P></P>
Diviners have the normal strengths and weaknesses of specialty wizards. In
addition, at 11th level the diviner gains the ability to use <I>find traps </I>(a 2nd-level priest spell) up to three times per day by pointing in a specific
direction and concentrating one round. At 14th level, the diviner becomes
immune to all forms of scrying spells such as <I>ESP, know alignment, </I>or <I>clairaudience; </I>characters trying to use these divinations against the diviner simply get no
response at all.
<P></P>
A diviner is very limited in his combat ability and must rely on spells
outside his school for anything resembling a damaging attack. However, a diviner in a
PC party can be surprisingly effective by providing advice and information.
With a diviner around, a party can look for ways to strike at an enemy-s weakest
points and to maximize its efficiency in battle.
