This is a simple all-purpose tool which can be used for forcing windows open,
levering open chests with locks which refuse to be picked, and for similar
purposes. At the DM's option, use of a crowbar adds +10 to any bend bars roll the
thief has to make when trying to force open some portal. A crowbar is usually a
metal rod 3 to 4 feet in length, with one end slightly crooked and often with a
snake-tongue division in it. The DM may allow a thief to use a crowbar as a
weapon, although a weapon proficiency slot would have to be used to avoid a
non-proficiency penalty in its usage. Damage is d6+1 versus S/M creatures, d6 versus
large opponents if the thief has proficiency. Otherwise, it inflicts damage as
a club.
