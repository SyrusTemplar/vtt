<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Time Bomb:</B> A <I>time bomb</I> resembles a small hourglass without sand. To set the bomb, the user removes
one base from the hourglass and fills one end with an amount of sand of the
user's choice (ranging from one minute's worth of sand to one hour's worth). When
the hourglass is set on a flat surface so that the sand begins to trickle from
one end to the other, the <I>time bomb</I> is activated.
<P></P>
When all the sand has trickled to the bottom of the hourglass, it explodes in
a ball of flame equal to a <I>fireball </I>spell cast at 5th level, delivering 5d6 points of damage and filling a 20-foot
radius. Victims within this area who make a successful saving throw vs. spell
suffer only half damage.
<P></P>
If an activated <I>time bomb</I> is shattered, tipped over, or otherwise disturbed before it detonates, its
magic is permanently negated; it cannot be reactivated. From that time on,
however, it can be used as a normal hourglass.
