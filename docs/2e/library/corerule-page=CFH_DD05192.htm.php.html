The Warrior is a character whose primary function is combat, and combat is
what this chapter is all about. Though the <I>AD&amp;DÂ®</I> game combat system is sufficient to most of your combat needs, this chapter
will give you optional rules and advice which can add flavor to your game.
<P></P>
It's important to remember that everything in this chapter is an <I>optional rule</I>; nothing recommended here can be implemented in your campaign without the
DM's permission.
