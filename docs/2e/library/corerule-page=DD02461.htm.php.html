If the attacker’s waist is higher than his opponent’s head, he gains a +1
bonus to his attack rolls. Stairways, tabletops, and steep slopes may create
higher-ground opportunities for a character in combat. This doesn’t apply to colossal
creatures such as giants who are fighting on level ground against much shorter
characters, nor does it apply to mounted characters; they already get a bonus.
