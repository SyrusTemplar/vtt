<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Artistic Ability:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Player characters with artistic ability are naturally accomplished in various
forms of the arts. They have an inherent understanding of color, form, space,
flow, tone, pitch, and rhythm. Characters with artistic ability must select one
art form (painting, sculpture, composition, etc.) to be proficient in.
Thereafter they can attempt to create art works or musical compositions in their given
field. Although it is not necessary to make a proficiency check, one can be
made to determine the quality of the work. If a 1 is rolled on the check, the
artist has created a work with some truly lasting value. If the check fails, the
artist has created something aesthetically unpleasing or just plain bad.
<P></P>
Artistic ability also confers a +1 bonus to all proficiency checks requiring
artistic skill--music or dance--and to attempts to appraise objects of art.
