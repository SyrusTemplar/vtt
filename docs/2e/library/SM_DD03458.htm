Bookbinding is a demanding task; the pages must be glued or sewn to a common
backing of some kind, protected by various kinds of varnishes or treatments, and
then fastened to a strong and durable cover. Additional chemicals or compounds to
ward off mildew and deter moths and bookworms are a necessary precaution.

Bookbinding is especially helpful for a wizard assembling a spell book.
Normally, a wizard must pay a bookbinder 50 gp per page for a standard spell book, or
100 gp per page for a traveling spell bookâ€”see Chapter 7 of the <A HREF="DMG_DD00333.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00333.htm">DMG</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> <I>.</I> A wizard who does this work himself reduces these costs by 50%, although the
process takes at least two weeks, plus one day per five pages. If the character
passes a proficiency check, his spell book gains a +2 bonus to item saving
throws due to the quality and craftsmanship of the work. In addition, the wizard
must succeed in a proficiency check if he is dealing with unusual or unsuitable
materials, such as metal sheets for pages or dragon scales for a cover.
