Sense shifting</I> allows the wizard to affect all spells of levels 1 through 3 that he casts
within the duration of the spell. For each spell, he can modify one of three
sensory features pertaining to the spell: color, sound, or patterned visual
appearance of the spell effect. The changes produced by this spell do not affect the
functions of the affected spell nor any saving throws that apply against their
effects.
<P></P>
<I>Sense shifting</I> might be used to produce green <I>fireballs, magic missiles</I> that streak through the air with a scream, colored<I> continual light</I> globes, customized designs for a <I>hypnotic pattern</I>, or a <I>spectral hand</I> that makes scrabbling sounds as it attempts to grasp a target.
<P></P>
<I>Sense shifting</I> cannot create any form of invisibility. It cannot completely silence a spell
effect (thus, a <I>fireball's</I> blast might be muted, but not wholly eliminated).
<P></P>
The material component is a twist of multi-colored ribbon with a small silver
bell fastened to its end.
