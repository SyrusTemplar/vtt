<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Acid</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> damage is particularly grim. Aside from the possibility of scarring (which is
left to the DM), acid damage cannot be healed by regeneration. It must be
healed normally. Thus, it is very useful against regenerating creatures such as
trolls. Acid is very rare.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Holy Water</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">affects most forms of undead and creatures from the Lower Planes. It has no
effect against a creature in gaseous form or undead without material form.
<P></P>
Unholy water (essentially holy water used by evil priests) affects paladins,
creatures whose purpose is to defend good (lammasu, shedu, etc.), and creatures
and beings from the Upper Planes.
<P></P>
Holy (or unholy) water affects creatures as does acid, causing damage that
cannot be regenerated but must be healed normally.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Oil</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> causes damage only when it is lit. This normally requires a two-step
process--first soaking the target in flammable oil and then setting it afire. Thus,
using flaming oil often requires two successful attacks.
<P></P>
A direct hit from flaming oil burns for two rounds, causing 2d6 points of
damage in the first round and 1d6 points in the second round.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Poison</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> is generally not very effective as a missile weapon. Most poisons take effect
only if the missile scores a direct hit, and even then only if it drops into
the gaping maw of some huge creature. Contact poisons have normal poison effects
on a direct hit. The DM has information about specific poison effects in the <A HREF="DMG_DD00489.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00489.htm">DMG</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
