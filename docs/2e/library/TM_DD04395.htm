The <I>conformance</I> spell has a simple principle with a profound effect: probable events always
manifest.
<P></P>
In game terms, this means that events with a probability of 51% or better
always occur. Thus, if a saving throw of 9 is required to avoid an effect, no roll
is necessary; the save is automatically successful. If a warrior must roll 10
or better to hit an enemy, he automatically hits.
<P></P>
Conversely, improbable actions (those with less than a 50% chance) always
fail. If a warrior must roll 12 or better to hit an enemy, he automatically fails.
If a thief's chance to hide in shadows is 49%, he automatically fails.
<P></P>
There are two conditions that affect this spell. First, a <I>prayer</I> spell is continuously operative in the area of effect, shifting the balance
of combat probabilities toward the favor of the priest who casts this spell and
his companions. Second, probabilities of exactly 50% always shift in favor of
the spellcasting priest. For example, if a roll of 11 or better is needed to
save against a spell effect, this is a 50% chance for success. In such cases, the
priest and his friends always make the save and enemies always fail.
<P></P>
This spell is particularly potent if <I>bless</I> and <I>chant</I> spells are cast in the area of effect.
