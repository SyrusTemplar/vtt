</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Introduction</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Welcome to Player-s Option <I>Skills &amp; Powers</I>, the companion to the Player-s Option<I> Combat &amp; Tactics</I> book. This volume unveils new role-playing possibilities without increasing
the complexity of the AD&amp;D? game. Just as the <I>Combat &amp; Tactics</I> book widened the scope of encounters, this tome expands character creation.
Together, these books heighten players? involvement with their characters, the
campaign, and the AD&amp;D game as a whole. Use what you like, change what you don-t
like, and above all have fun!

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4"> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The chapters in this book are building blocks for constructing Player-s Option
characters. AD&amp;D game players will find several familiar terms, such as kits.
But these kits are different than those presented in supplements such as <I>The Complete Fighter-s Handbook</I>. Instead, Player-s Option kits are packages coupled with special skills that
add depth and flavor to characters. There are other changes and additions, and
these will unfold as you read this book. One such change is selecting character
abilities using a character point system. Here-s an overview of what character
points do:

<A NAME="57b7e2df"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Character Points</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Every character begins play with a number of character points determined by
his race and class. Further, every time a character advances a level, he gains 3
to 5 character points. The character point system is a new concept for the
AD&amp;D game. The points serve numerous purposes, and these are summarized below.
Note: This book assumes that a typical campaign will award 3 CPs per level, and
that most characters will use one of these during play (see below). Larger
character point awards will result in a higher-powered campaign, but if both DM and
players agree, that-s fine-enjoy yourselves.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Character points are used to purchase weapon proficiencies. New weapon
proficiencies usually cost 2 or 3 character points. This is discussed in <A HREF="DD03142.htm#aa4e7e39"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03142.htm#aa4e7e39">chapter seven</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Similarly, character points are used to purchase nonweapon proficiencies.
Purchasing a nonweapon proficiency usually costs from 2 to 5 points. Also,
character points are used to purchase traits, and bonus character points are awarded
for taking disadvantages. This is discussed in <A HREF="DD03005.htm#19fbe61c"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03005.htm#19fbe61c">chapter six</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Points can be used to increase proficiency scores. One character point
improves a proficiency score by a +1 permanent bonus. For example, A wizard with an
Intelligence of 17 has a spellcraft proficiency score of 11. The character will
successfully use this proficiency on a d20 roll of 11 or less. The wizard could
improve this score from 11 to 12 by spending 1 character point. This is covered
in <A HREF="DD03006.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03006.htm">chapter six</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Points can be spent to acquire racial abilities for demihumans, such as
infravision or the elves? attack bonus with swords or bows. Racial abilities cost 5
to 10 character points. Humans have no racial abilities and can spend their
points in other ways. This is discussed in <A HREF="DD02893.htm#1e36fe39"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02893.htm#1e36fe39">chapter three</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Player characters can spend points on acquiring class abilities, such as the
paladin-s capacity to<I> lay on hands</I>. Each class ability usually costs 10 character points. There is more
information about this in <A HREF="DD02933.htm#6be9b6c5"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02933.htm#6be9b6c5">chapter four</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Priests and wizards can spend points to gain extra spells. Only one additional
enchantment per level can be purchased this way, and the cost is 2 points plus
1 point per level of the spell purchased. Priests and wizards cannot purchase
higher level spells than they can cast.

<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Points can be spent to improve a character-s roll for additional hit points
when advancing a level. For every 2 character points spent, the player can roll
one additional die when determining new hit points, taking the highest number
from the dice rolled.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Character points also can be used in the course of play, not just during
character creation or between adventures. During a game session, a player can spend
saved points to give his character a second chance to accomplish a feat, or to
reroll a failed attack, saving throw, proficiency check, or even a low damage
roll.
<P></P>
<P></P>
For example, Leon chooses to save 2 character points after creating his
fighter. During a game, Leon-s fighter tries to strike an ogre. The attack roll
fails. However, the ogre strikes the fighter, wounding him badly. In the next round,
fearing for his fighter-s life, Leon declares that he will spend a character
point if his attack misses. The roll indeed fails, and Leon now can spend a
point and reroll his attack. If this attack roll succeeds, the first roll is
ignored and Leon-s fighter has struck the ogre. If the reroll failed, Leon-s
character still misses and play continues.
<P></P>
Regardless of any reroll-s success, any character points spent are lost.
Players can continue to spend points as long as they declare so before rolling any
dice-and as long as they have points to spend. This mechanic allows characters
a second chance to accomplish important tasks or to achieve feats vital to the
story.
