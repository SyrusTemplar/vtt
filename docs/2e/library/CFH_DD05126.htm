<P></P>
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> When constructing a weapon, at the end of the weapon-making process, the
weaponsmith makes his Weaponsmithing proficiency ability check. He'll use the
Proficiency Modifier based on the weapon and the weapon quality he's trying to
achieve; see the chart below, under &quot;Weapon Quality,&quot; for that modifier.
<P></P>
If he successfully makes his check, he's created the weapon he wanted to
create.
<P></P>
If he fails by 1, 2, 3, or 4, he's created a weapon that looks like what he
intended to make. . . but he knows it has a serious structural flaw. In a real
combat, if the wielder rolls a natural 5 or less on his attack roll, the weapon
breaks and is useless. (For some reason, it just won't break in practice
combats. . . only in the real thing.) He can still sell the weapon, of course, but
eventually, after he's done this sort of thing a few times, his reputation as a
craftsman will be utterly ruined. It's better just to break the item, sell it as
a wall-hanger, etc.
<P></P>
If he fails by 5 or more, the weapon breaks and is ruined during the last
stages of the creation process (for example, when it's being cooled after
heat-tempering).
