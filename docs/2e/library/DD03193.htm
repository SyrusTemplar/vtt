<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Every psionicist and wild talent character has psionic strength points, or
PSPs. In many ways, PSPs are like mental hit points, though with a different
function. Not only do they determine a character?s current psionic strength, they
also power psionic abilities. This mental strength is used to create psionic
attacks, activate psionic powers, and keep psionic defenses in place. As long as
any PSPs remain, psionic defenses keep the mind closed to psionic intrusion of
any sort. When a psionic character?s PSP total falls to zero, his defenses
crumble and his mind is left open to psionic contact.
<P></P>
Each time a character uses (or attempts to use) a psionic science, devotion,
or attack, he must pay the listed cost from his current PSP total. Damage caused
by psionic attacks is also subtracted from PSP totals.
<P></P>
The PSP total for a psionicist depends on four factors: the psionicist?s
Wisdom, Intelligence, and Constitution scores, and his experience level. Together,
these factors determine the psionicist?s PSP pool. A 1st-level psionicist
automatically gets 15 PSPs. This number is modified by bonuses granted by high
ability scores. Lastly, the psionicist rolls 1d6, which is added to generate a PSP
total.
<P></P>
The PSP total for a wild talent is determined with slight modifications. A
wild talent automatically receives enough PSPs to use his power (or powers) once.
In addition, he gets 10 PSPs (instead of 15) and any bonuses granted for high
Wisdom, Intelligence, and Constitution scores. He also rolls 1d4, instead of 1d6.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Example:</B> <I>Tylk of the Westwoods has a Wisdom score of 18, an Intelligence score of 16,
and a Constitution score of 17. At 1st level, he gets 21 PSPs (15 + 3 + 1 + 2 =
21) plus a 1d6 die roll. Garon, a wild talent with the same ability scores,
gets 16 PSPs (10 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 16), a 1d4 die roll, and enough PSPs to use his
psionic power once.

Psionicists receive 1d6 PSPs with each level increase up to 9th level, plus
any bonuses for high Wisdom, Intelligence, and Constitution scores. Starting at
9th level, psionicists gain just 3 PSPs, and they receive bonuses <I>only</I> for high Wisdom scores. Regardless of their Intelligence or Constitution
scores, they no longer receive bonuses for these abilities. Wild talents, on the
other hand, receive only 4 PSPs at each level increase, regardless of their
level. Further, no die rolls or additional modifiers are applied.
<P></P>
<B>Example:</B> <I>The psionicist Tylk of the Westwoods has a Wisdom score of 18, an Intelligence
score of 16, and a Constitution score of 17. When he advances from 1st to 2nd
level, he receives 1d6+6 PSPs: the automatic 1d6 die roll and a +6 bonus for
his high ability scores.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Characters recover expended <A HREF="DD03189.htm#58c8142a"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03189.htm#58c8142a">PSPs</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> by resting for specific lengths of time (minimum of one full hour). The only
states of rest that allow for PSP recovery are sleep or meditation. Any other
physical activity or the use of psionic powers (which expend PSPs) negates the
recovery process for that hour. A character can never recover more PSPs than his
maximum total.
<P></P>
During each hour of rest, characters recover one-eighth of their total PSPs
(bearing in mind that they never recover more than their maximum total). To do
this, divide a character?s PSP total by eight and round up. This is the number of
PSPs the character recovers after one full hour of rest. So, if a psionicist
is reduced to 0 PSPs, it takes eight full hours of rest to recover the expended
PSPs?regardless of whether he has 20 or 100 PSPs.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Example:</B> <I>Neecha Nightmoon has a total of 48 PSPs, and she has lost 24 of them during a
recent psionic battle. After an hour of sleep or meditation, Neecha can recover
6 of the expended PSPs (48 ? 8 = 6). She is now at 30 PSPs.
