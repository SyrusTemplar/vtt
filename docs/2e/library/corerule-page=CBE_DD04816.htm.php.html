Most of the published AD&amp;D campaigns have a fairly even mix of the various
races, although they tend to allow humans to predominate more often than any other
race. Since humans have the most drive and ambition of any of the established
humanoid races, it is only natural that their power always be taken into
account when considering who controls the world.

races' dominance and how such changes would affect the lives of elves on these
worlds.
