As the <I>Player's Handbook</I> explains, this ability is not literally just the knack of hiding in areas of
shadow while not moving. It also covers hiding in bushes, shrubs, behind
drapes, in alcovesâ€”anywhere where there is a chance of skulking about immobile in
some location which offers cover and the hope of staying unseen. Considering
appropriate equipment needs to be considered in this light.
