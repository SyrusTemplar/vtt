<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Priests are versatile characters, with good fighting skills, potent spells,
and a variety of special powers and talents. Combining the priest-s range of
spell powers with the talents of another class results in a very capable character.
As described in the <A HREF="PHB_DD01512.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01512.htm">Player's Handbook</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> , dwarves, gnomes, and half-elves may all be multi-classed priests: dwarves
may be fighter/clerics; gnomes may be fighter/clerics, cleric/illusionists, or
cleric/thieves; and half-elves may be fighter/clerics, fighter/druids, cleric or
druid/rangers, cleric or druid/mages, or fighter/mage/clerics or druids.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Specialty Priests: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Unless otherwise noted, a multi-classed priest character must be a cleric and
not any other kind of specialty priest. Some campaign settings may have
world-specific guidelines for multi-classed specialty priests; the campaign setting
rules take precedence over other material in the <A HREF="PHB_DD01511.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01511.htm">Player's Handbook</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> <I>, Player's Option: <A HREF="SP_DD02964.htm#f6c7b94e"></A></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="SP_DD02964.htm#f6c7b94e">Skills &amp; Powers</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> , </I>or<I> Player's Option: Spells &amp; Magic</I>.
<P></P>
At the DM-s option, some of the varieties of specialty priest presented in <A HREF="DD03419.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03419.htm">Chapter 2</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> may be added to the list of multi-classed combinations. (See the chart
below.) Since the capabilities of the various specialty priests are comparable to
each other, there is no penalty for choosing to be a crusader or druid instead of
a cleric.

<B>Restrictions: </B>The only limitation that applies to a multi-classed priest is the restricted
selection of weapons available to a cleric or druid. Regardless of the
character-s other class, he must abide by the weapon selection of his priest class. Of
course, crusaders are able to wield any weapon, since they are not normally
limited in this regard.
<P></P>
<B>Optional powers: </B>With the DM-s approval, multi-classed priests may select optional abilities
described in <A HREF="DD03434.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03434.htm">Chapter 3</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> , including animal empathy, casting time reduction, cold resistance,
communication, detect evil, detect undead, expert healer, extended spell duration,
fire/electrical resistance, identify plants and animals, immunity to charm,
immunity to magic, immunity to natural disease, inspire/enrage allies, know alignment,
lay on hands, pass without trace, purify water, resist energy drain, secret
language, spell-like granted power, and turn undead. These can be paid for by
balancing advantages with restrictions of equal value; the priest may choose any
limitation except armor restriction (for druids) or weapon restriction.
Optionally, the priest can accept an experience point penalty of 30% plus 1% for each
point he spends on additional abilities. For example, a priest who chooses know
alignment (15 points) reduces the number of experience points he earns by 45
percent.
