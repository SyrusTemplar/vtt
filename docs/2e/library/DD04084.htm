Wemics are leonine counterparts to centaurs.
<P></P>
A wemic's body consists of a leonine body with a humanoid torso extending from
what would be a lion's neck. The typical wemic measures ten feet from head to
rump. When standing erect in centaurian posture, the wemic stands 6 to 7 feet
tall.
<P></P>
Most of the body is covered in dusky golden fur. The tail is tipped by a brush
of long, black hair. Adult males also have a mane of long black hair; the mane
covers the top and back of the head and extends to the neck and shoulders.
Male cubs develop this mane in their third year. The underbelly is covered in
short, white fur. The nose may be black or russet. The eyes are gold with
vertically slit pupils. The digits on all limbs end in claws. The claws on the forelegs
are retractable.
<P></P>
Wemics speak their own leonine language and a highly accented dialect of the
common tongue.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Wemics use forepaws and weapons to attack. A claw delivers a vicious swipe
that inflicts 1d4 points of damage. Normally the wemic uses his forelegs to claw
and employs his hands to wield a weapon.
<P></P>
Wemic males carry javelins and either a stone club or short sword. They often
carry a tough leather shield (AC 5) for protection. Females are AC 7 and do not
use weapons; however, they gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls if their cubs are
attacked. Cubs under 2 years do not attack.
<P></P>
Wemics possess keen senses. They are masters of ambushes and hunting strategy.
If they cannot surprise an intended victim, 1-3 wemics move to outflank prey.
<P></P>
Wemics possess powerful leg muscles. They can leap 10 feet upward or 30 feet
forward.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Wemic society is a blend of leonine and aboriginal human cultures. They live
in groups called prides. A typical pride consists of 4d4 adult males, 2d12 adult
females, and 1d12 cubs.
<P></P>
Up to 3d10 prides often band together into a tribe that is led by a chief. The
chief has an Armor Class of 5, 6+4 Hit Dice, and its claws inflict 1d6 points
of damage. It gains a +1 bonus to its attack rolls with any weapon.
<P></P>
Sometimes 2d4 tribes join together into a clan or nation. Such a grand
gathering is led by a king and 2d4 chieftains. The king has an Armor Class of 3, 9 Hit
Dice, and claws that inflict 1d8 points of damage. It has a +2 bonus to its
attack rolls with any weapon.
<P></P>
Some wemics are able to use magic. There is a 70% chance that any tribe
includes a witch doctor. Such wemics may attain a maximum level of 7th-level priest
and 4th-level wizard.
<P></P>
Mating occurs at any time of year. The female bears a litter of one to three
cubs in ten months. The cubs are born with a camouflage pattern of black spots;
these fade within two months. Wemic cubs are playful and curious; they possess
few instincts and thus must learn everything. Cubs are born with 1 HD and gain
2 HD each year. They reach maturity at age 3.
<P></P>
Wemics have human-level intelligence. They possess a Stone age culture, using
fire and possessing modest manufacturing skills with which they can create
stone weaponry, pottery, and ornaments. They can be taught more complex skills.
They are excellent trackers and guides. They may hire out their services in
exchange for treasure and tools, such as weapons and magical items. They may also
charge travelers a toll for safe passage through their nation's territory.
