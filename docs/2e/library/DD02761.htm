<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Vehicles </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Most vehicles are simply used to get people or materials from place to place
and have no function on the battlefield, except as objects of contention
(wagonloads of rare merchandise or tax money often attract considerable attention).
Some vehicles are designed to function as weapons, however, and most offer their
passengers some concealment or cover. The most common types are listed below.
