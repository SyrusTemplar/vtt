Remember that it is easier to build a balanced campaign than to fix one that’s
out of control. A campaign that is in control has a reasonable balance between
the hazards the PCs face and the rewards they gain. A controlled campaign also
has a reasonable survival rate among characters who are played well.
<P></P>
To build a balanced game, start by reading Chapter Eight in the <A HREF="DMG_DD00382.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DMG_DD00382.htm">DMG</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">. Decide how quickly you want your player characters to advance, and set up
your campaign’s experience point awards accordingly.
<P></P>
You also need to keep an eye on the treasure and magic you give out. You
should decide in advance how much magic you want the PCs to have, then carefully
place it, making sure that the PCs have to take appropriate risks to get it.
Killing an orc to get a <I>long sword +5, holy avenger</I> is too much reward for too little risk. If the PCs seem to be finding too
much magic, make it harder to find by removing some undiscovered magical treasures
or making sure that unattended magical items are well-hidden and defended by
traps, curses, or spells. Remember to regularly take excess magic out of
circulation.
<P></P>
How much magic is enough? That’s up to you to decide. If you’ve decided that
magic is going to be fairly rare, a PC should expect to find about one permanent
or rechargeable magical item for every two or three levels of experience, plus
one or two additional consumable items for every two levels of experience.
This means that if you’re following the <I>DMG’s</I> suggestion of three to six adventures between character levels, a party of
six characters should find only about one item every adventure (after six to
twelve adventures, all six characters have at least one magical item). Note that a
character might own considerably fewer magical items because they are used up
or destroyed during play.
