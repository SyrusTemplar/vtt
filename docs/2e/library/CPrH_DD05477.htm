These are ordinary prayers and rituals which the priest conducts on a regular
basis. They might include the saying of prayers at specific times of the day,
upon observation of specific incidents or natural phenomena, and so forth.

The DM can decide what these are and when they're undertaken, but the campaign
shouldn't devote a lot of time to them; it's annoying and disconcerting to
interrupt the adventure every so often so that the priests can pull out their holy
symbols, kneel to the sun, and lead the faithful in prayer. Just knowing that
they do this sort of thing on a regular basis is enough for most players.
