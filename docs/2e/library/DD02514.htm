After the patterns are established and read, combat is conducted as per the
combat system in <A HREF="DD02403.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02403.htm">Chapter One</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. If a figure must close to make an attack, the figures are moved accordingly.
At the end of the round, the players must move their figures on the board one
space in the direction they chose as their defensive positioning. In other
words, if a duelist tumbled forward, that figure moves forward one space.
<P></P>
If for some reason the two figures end up in the same square, an opposed
Strength check is made to see who gains the square and who is pushed back a square.
The combatant who wins the square always pushes his foe in the opposite
direction from where the winner came in.
