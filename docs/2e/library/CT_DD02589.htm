On the Astral Plane, a creature’s tactical movement is based on its
Intelligence score. Its move becomes 30 feet (6 squares) per point of Intelligence. In
addition, Intelligence replaces Stength for purposes of determining attack and
damage adjustments, and Wisdom replaces Dexterity for AC adjustments and missile
fire. All missile ranges are doubled, but non-native characters suffer a –2
penalty to hit with missile attacks.
<P></P>
There are very few obstructions in the Astral Plane, and the encounter range
is normally twice the longest missile range. Since this is most likely a great
distance, astral combat should be run in missile scale. Fighting in the Astral
is like aerial combat; creatures do not threaten each other, and can move in
three dimensions.

If a character’s astral self is killed, she immediately returns to her
physical body with only 1 hit point. If the character is killed while physically on
the plane, she is dead.
