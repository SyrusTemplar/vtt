This power resembles magical <I>polymorphing</I>, but it has a wider application. The user can change himself into anything
with approximately the same mass as his body: a wolf, a chair, or even a tree.
While in this form, the user retains his own hit points and THAC0, but he gains
the AC of the new form. He also gains all physical attacks the form allows, but
no magical or special abilities. A new attack ability depends on the form
chosen; a tree, for example, can?t attack, so it has no THAC0. Nonmagical movement
is also gained. If the user metamorphs into another character race, use the <I>Monstrous Manual</I> book?s descriptions for that race.
<P></P>
Some forms have intrinsic advantages. Changing into a fish or rock renders the
user immune to drowning, though he doesn?t retain any senses not normally
associated with his new form. He may opt to keep some of his own senses when he
transforms, but these are likely to give him away.
<P></P>
Like any massive change of shape, metamorphosis causes great physical stress.
The user must make a system shock roll. If the roll fails, he expends 6 PSPs,
changes form only for 1 round, and immediately passes out for 2d6 turns.
