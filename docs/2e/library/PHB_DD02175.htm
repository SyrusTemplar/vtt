This spell is similar to a <I>light</I> spell, except that it is as bright as full daylight and lasts until negated
by magical darkness or by a <I>dispel magic</I> spell. Creatures with penalties in bright light suffer them in this spell's
area of effect. As with the <I>light</I> spell, this can be cast into the air, onto an object, or at a creature. In
the third case, the continual light affects the space about 1 foot behind a
creature that successfully rolls its saving throw vs. spell (a failed saving throw
means the continual light is centered on the creature and moves as it moves).
Note that this spell also blinds a creature if it is successfully cast upon the
creature's visual organs. If the spell is cast on a small object that is then
placed in a light-proof covering, the spell effects are blocked until the
covering is removed.
<P></P>
Continual light brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa)
cancels the darkness so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the
overlapping areas of effect. A direct casting of a <I>continual light</I> spell against a similar or weaker magical darkness cancels both.
<P></P>
This spell eventually consumes the material it is cast upon, but the process
takes far longer than the time in a typical campaign. Extremely hard and
expensive materials might last hundreds or even thousands of years.
<P></P>
The reverse spell, <I>continual darkness,</I> causes complete absence of light (pitch blackness), similar to the <I>darkness</I> spell but of greater duration and area.
