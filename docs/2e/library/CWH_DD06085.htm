<B>Description:</B> Spells from the school of illusion bend reality to create apparent changes in
the environment, in the caster, or in other persons or creatures. These spells
do not cause real changes as alteration spells do, but instead alter the way
that creatures and persons perceive reality. This school includes both illusion
and phantasm spells (the differences are discussed in the Spell Analysis
section below).
<P></P>
<B>Specialist Name:</B> Illusionist.
<P></P>
<B>Allowed Races:</B> Humans and gnomes are eligible to become illusionists. It's not clear why
elves and half-elves are unable to specialize in this school, though some
speculate that the same inborn magical resistance that helps make them immune to charm
spells also limits their ability to focus the magical energy needed to create
illusions.
<P></P>
<B>Ability Requirements:</B> The somatic components of most medium-level and high-level illusions require
precise physical manipulations. Therefore, to specialize as an illusionist, a
wizard must have a minimum Dexterity score of 16.
<P></P>
<B> Saving Throw Modifiers:</B> Illusionists add a +1 bonus when rolling saving throws against any type of
illusion. Opponents suffer a -1 penalty when rolling saving throws against
illusion/phantasm spells cast by an illusionist. These modifiers are only used
against illusions where saving throws are applicable.
<P></P>
<B>Bonus Spells and Acquired Powers:</B> An illusionist can memorize an extra spell at each spell level, providing
that at least one of the memorized spells is from the school of illusion.
<P></P>
When an illusionist reaches 18th level, he adds a +1 bonus when saving against
illusions cast by non-illusionists. (Since this is in addition to his natural
+1 modifier, his saving throw bonus against these attack forms effectively
becomes +2.)
<P></P>
When an illusionist reaches 20th level, he acquires the ability to cast a
special <I>dispel illusion</I> spell three times per day. The spell has a range of 30 yards and a casting
time of 1. To cast this spell, the illusionist merely points at the subject and
concentrates; no somatic or material components are required. This spell enables
the illusionist to dispel any type of <I>phantasmal force</I>, including those augmented by <I>audible glamer</I>; however, <I>dispel illusion</I> is effective only on <I>phantasmal force</I> spells cast by non-illusionists.
<P></P>
<I>Dispel illusion</I> has a base chance of success of 50 percent. For each level of experience that
the illusionist exceeds the caster of the<I> phantasmal force</I>, the chance of success is increased by 5 percent. For each level the caster
exceeds the illusionist, the chance is reduced by 5 percent. (For instance, if a
20th-level illusionist attempts to dispel a<I> phantasmal force</I> created by a 15th-level mage, the illusionist's chance of success is 75
percent. ) If an illusionist casts <I>dispel illusion</I> at a subject that isn't an illusion, there is no effect, but the attempt
counts against the illusionist's daily limit of <I>dispel illusion</I> spells.
<P></P>
<B>Oppositional Schools:</B> An illusionist cannot learn spells from the schools of necromancy,
invocation/evocation, and abjuration.
<P></P>
<B>Spell Analysis:</B> Spells of this school can be grouped into two general categories: illusions
and phantasms. Illusions are spells that simulate reality, creating artificial
conditions of light, color, sound, and scent. <I>Audible glamer</I> is an example of an illusion that simulates sound. In general, the
lower-level illusions are of limited use in combat situations, providing neither direct
protection from damage nor the ability to inflict damage on opponents. Though
most illusions create only the appearance of reality, some high-level spells tap
extradimensional forces to create illusions with physical substance, capable of
inflicting damage and otherwise interacting with the real world. Shadow
monsters is an example of a quasi-real illusion. These are the most useful types of
illusion spells in combat, as they can create illusionary creatures to attack
opponents and execute an assortment of other tactical actions. Another type of
illusion focuses extradimensional forces to alter the physical form of the
caster. <I>Wraithform </I>is an example. These are especially good defensive spells, as they protect the
caster from a variety of attack forms.
<P></P>
Phantasms are the second general group of illusion spells. Phantasms directly
manipulate the perception of their victims. Phantasms do not create images,
they induce responses. <I>Spook</I> is an example of a phantasm that induces the response of fear. Phantasms are
also good defensive spells, more so than illusions that alter the caster's
form, since they can affect a number of opponents within a given range.
<P></P>
Because spells from the school of illusion are mainly concerned with the
creation of images and are of limited use on the battlefield, many feel that
illusionists are the weakest of all the specialists. In a broad sense, however, no
school provides a wizard with more options, since in most cases, illusion spells
are limited only by the caster's imagination. For instance, consider the
1st-level illusion spell <I>phantasmal force</I>. A dull-witted wizard might consider this a useless spell; after all, its
illusions have only visual components. A silent monster might scare away a nervous
bandit, but what else can you do with it? Plenty, answers the creative
illusionist, and the effects aren't confined to the battlefield. Here are some
examples:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> The party is being pursued by a hoard of orcs. The wizard uses<I> phantasmal force</I> to create the illusion of a wall of bramble bushes behind the party to slow
down the pursuers. Alternately, he creates a swarm of wasps, a cloud of ominous
green gas, or a pool of quicksand to slow them down.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> The hungry party wants to catch some fish for the evening meal. They have
lines and hooks, but no bait. The wizard uses <I>phantasmal force</I> to create a colorful, sparkling lure.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> The party wishes to lure an enemy into a cave for an ambush. The wizard uses <I>phantasmal force</I> to create the illusion of great treasure just inside the cave and -- in goes
the greedy enemy.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> The wizard has met a beautiful damsel whom he wishes to impress. He takes her
to a secluded woodland and uses <I>phantasmal force</I> to create the illusion of a patch of beautiful wild flowers.
<P></P>
<B>Most Desirable Spells:</B>
<P></P>
Low-Level: <I>Phantasmal force, ventriloquism, improved phantasmal force</I>, and <I>spectral force</I> are the most versatile low- level illusionist spells when wielded by a
creative caster. <I>Spook, invisibility, wraithform,</I> and <I>invisibility, 10' radius</I> are excellent defensive spells.
<P></P>
Medium-Level: With access to 4th-level and higher spells, the illusionist
becomes a strong combatant, as he can take advantage of powerful, quasi-real
illusions such as <I>phantasmal killer, shadow monsters, demi-shadow monsters, shadow magic,
demi-shadow magic</I>, and <I>shades</I>. The options for the creative illusionist also expand, with access to the
complex creations possible with <I>minor creation, advanced illusion, major creation, permanent illusion,</I> and <I>programmed illusion</I>.
<P></P>
High-Level: Unfortunately, the number of spells available to the illusionist
drops dramatically at higher levels. <I>Shadow walk</I> is invaluable if the wizard anticipates travel to the plane of shadow; in
certain situations, it also functions as an effective banishment spell.<I> Mass invisibility</I> can mean the difference between victory and defeat in combat involving a
large number of participants. <I>Simulacrum</I> has the most possibilities of all the creation illusions, while <I>weird </I>can be the most deadly of all the offensive illusion spells.
<P></P>
<B>Ethos:</B> Illusionists tend to be flamboyant, outgoing, and self-assured. Remarkably
creative, they enjoy art, literature, poetry, and music, and many are
accomplished artists in their own rights. Though their aptitude for scholarly pursuits is
as high as any other specialist, illusionists tend to spend less time involved
in research, preferring the company of people to the isolation of the
laboratory.
<P></P>
Illusionists have sharp minds, but they are not particularly deep thinkers.
Pragmatic by nature, they accept the impermanence of all things, believing that
any attempt at developing an all- encompassing philosophy to explain the meaning
of existence is ultimately futile and therefore a waste of time. Illusionists
tend to be of good and neutral alignments, since wizards inclined toward evil
usually opt for a specialization they perceive as being more powerful.
<P></P>
Because of their forceful personalities and sharp minds, illusionists make
good leaders of an adventuring party, but they also make equally good lieutenants
and strategists. Because low-level and medium-level illusionists usually lack
defensive spells, a party must provide bodyguards or other protection to keep
them healthy; such illusionists are best kept in the center of the party when
traveling.
<P></P>
Illusionists enjoy the hustle and bustle of urban life, and usually maintain
well-furnished homes in the heart of a city. They usually have a host of friends
and acquaintances, and are loyal and loving spouses. Illusionists earn a
living as entertainers, artists, mercenaries, teachers, and shopkeepers
