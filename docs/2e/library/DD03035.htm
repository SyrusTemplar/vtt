<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Charioteering:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character with this skill can move a chariot at its normal speed, and
effectively drive it over a smooth, wide road. The proficient character requires no
check to drive or steer the chariot, including traveling across relatively
flat, open countryside, charging into battle, and performing the turns, stops, and
starts that might be required on the battlefield.
<P></P>
By making a proficiency check, the character can guide the chariot through
obstacles such as deep fords, steeply-climbing terrain, ditches, and rough or
rocky ground. Also, with a successful check, the character can add 1/3 to a
chariot-s movement rate for the duration of a charge or a march. However, failure of
this check means that the chariot moves at its normal rate, but that the horses
fatigue in half the normal time. Characters with the animal empathy trait gain
a +1 bonus to their ratings with this proficiency.
<P></P>
Note that certain obstacles are simply impassable to chariots, including
walls, water too deep (or too muddy on the bottom) to ford, thick forests, and
mountainous terrain.
