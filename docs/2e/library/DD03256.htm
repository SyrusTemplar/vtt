This power is used as a defense, creating a barrier of psionic energy around
the user and anyone within three yards of him. This barrier softens missile
blows, shielding the user from damage by slowing and absorbing some or all of the
potential damage caused by incoming attacks. However, the barrier also slows
outgoing missile attacks?a drawback the user should consider.
<P></P>
The power protects against damage from these forms of attack: any nonmagical
missile weapon; any physical missile created by magic; any missile with magical
bonuses; flames; some breath weapon attacks (depending on the nature of the
breath); acid; gas; all forms of disintegration; and falling (damage is halved).
Inertial barrier cannot stop missiles conjured from pure magic or protect
against raw heat or cold, pure energy or light, or gaze weapons. An inertial barrier
cannot keep enemies out, but it does slow them. Anyone trying to cross a
barrier must stop moving when contact is made. In the next round, the barrier can be
crossed (either entering or exiting).
<P></P>
Missile weapons, whether passing into or out of the barrier, inflict damage in
a modified fashion because the power saps energy from the missile. If a
missile strikes its target after passing through the barrier (in either direction),
the attacker rolls for damage as normal. However, the defender then rolls the
same die to see how much damage the barrier absorbed. (Note: The defender doesn?t
include any magical bonuses the weapon may have.) The defender subtracts his
die roll from the attacker?s damage total. If anything remains, the defender
loses that many hit points. If the defender?s roll equals or exceeds the total
damage, the weapon falls harmlessly to the ground. If the missile is explosive,
the barrier prevents weapon damage but not explosive damage.
