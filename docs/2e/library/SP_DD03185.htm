Potent magical forces can be locked in designs, symbols, and diagrams of
mystical significance. Geometers are wizards who study the summoning and control of
magic through the creation of intricate geometrical patterns, ranging from
runes drawn on paper or carved in stone to free-floating constructs composed of
brilliant lines of energy. For a geometer, the somatic component of a spell?the
gestures required to unlock the spell?s energy?represent the creation of an
extra-dimensional doorway through which magic is drawn and shaped into the form the
wizard desires.
<P></P>
Geometers, quite naturally, excel in the casting of any spell that involves
the use of a mark, rune, or diagram drawn upon the target of the spell. In fact,
a number of spells that are not normally cast in this fashion have been adapted
to the geometers? philosophy. For example, geometers cast a <I>hold portal</I> spell by placing a minor rune of power upon the door to be barred, and <I>animate dead</I> by drawing complicated designs upon the face and hands of the creature to be
reanimated. Geometers can also create effects with less substantial materials
by sketching a design in the air, as if they were drawing imaginary circles and
angles; depending on the power of the spell, this design may be visible as a
glowing web of blue or green energy created by the motion of the geometer?s hands.
<P></P>
Geometers enjoy the normal benefits and penalties of specialist wizards, but
they have no modifier to their saving throws and do not inflict any penalties to
their target?s saving throws. They do have the special ability to create
scrolls, much like alchemists can prepare potions. At 4th level, the geometer can
commit a spell that he knows and can cast to a scroll. He may read the scroll at
any time after transcribing the spell, just like casting a normal spell from a
scroll. However, the character may not have more than one scroll per character
level prepared at any given time?the incomplete magical diagrams become too
confusing and complex for the geometer to keep track of if he tries to keep too
many scrolls ready for casting.
<P></P>
Transcribing a spell to a scroll requires one full day per spell level, so
preparing a 5th-level spell for use in this fashion would take the wizard five
days of uninterrupted work. The materials (rare inks, fine parchment, etc.) cost
100 gold pieces per spell level, and the wizard requires a suitable laboratory
or library to work in. The geometer can transcribe any spell of the School of
Geometry that he knows, or he can engage in normal spell research to find a
diagram to convey a spell that he knows outside the School of Geometry. (Once he
successfully researches a new spell diagram, it is considered to be part of the
School of Geometry for that wizard.) In any event, the geometer must succeed in a
learn spells check to see if he successfully transcribed the spell.
<P></P>
Geometers may also attempt to create protection scrolls, beginning at 7th
level. The geometer must first research the scroll?s diagram through normal spell
research; scrolls with an XP value of 1,000 are considered to be equal to
4th-level spells; scrolls with an XP value of 1,500 are equal to 5th-level spells;
scrolls with an XP value of 2,000 are equal to 6th-level spells; and scrolls with
an XP value of 2,500 are equal to 7th-level spells. The research time is two
weeks per effective level, and the cost is 1000 gp per effective level. The
geometer must pass a learn spells check to successfully research the formula. Once
the geometer knows the diagram, he can produce one scroll by investing in
300?1800 gp worth of materials and spending one uninterrupted week in his
laboratory. Again, a learn spells roll applies to see if he followed the directions
correctly.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>The School of Geometry:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> As noted above, the School of Geometry consists of both diagrams that can be
drawn on the target, as well as geometrical designs that can be created through
gestures. Often, spells of this school require unusual writing implements?the
material components for the spell?but generally, no verbal components are
necessary. The School of Geometry is opposed by the Schools of Enchantment/Charm and
Illusion.
