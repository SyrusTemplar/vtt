?? Most forgathering sites have few permanent features or structures. Upon their
arrival, attendees construct any necessary buildings or fixtures, and take them
down when the forgathering ends. Forgathering fixtures are simple but
functional, with building materials consisting usually of wood, stones, and mud. Here
are a few features common to most sites:
<P></P>
?? <B>Sleeping Area.</B> The driest and clearest patch of ground makes the best sleeping area.
Attendees pitch their tents or lay out their sleeping bags in lines, spaced well
apart. In colder climates, the sleeping area is located where the sun (whatever
there is of it) can warm the earth before nightfall. In warmer climates, shady
locations are preferred.
<P></P>
?? <B>Dining Area.</B> A typical dining area consists of a few benches or logs for sitting on, some
stone barbecue pits, and a simple lean-to for storage. The optimum location for
the dining area is several hundred feet from the sleeping area, positioned so
that breezes don't carry the cookfire smoke in the direction of resting
rangers. A stream nearby for washing up is also desirable, if available.
<P></P>
?? <B>Fire Pit.</B> A pit for burning waste is constructed near the dining area, preferably away
from trees or brush to minimize the chance of a fire getting out of control.
It's located where the prevailing breezes don't carry the smell of burning
garbage toward the sleeping or dining areas.
<P></P>
?? <B>Barn.</B> A barn, stable, or pen is constructed to house the rangers' animal followers
for the duration of the forgathering. Large forgatherings may require several
pens and stables to accommodate a variety of species. Rangers are responsible
for the feeding and grooming of their animals, and are also held accountable for
their animals' behavior; it's considered a grievous breech of etiquette for a
lion follower of one ranger to eat the goat follower of another ranger.
<P></P>
?? <B>Chapel.</B> The forgathering chapel may be as simple as a stone platform, or as elaborate
as a full-sized cabin with a podium and wooden pews. Religious symbols are not
exhibited here, so that the chapel may accommodate worshipers of diverse
beliefs. Most often, the chapel is isolated from the main forgathering site, erected
in a nearby woodland or other quiet location.
<P></P>
?? <B>Campfire.</B> The communal campfire, typically constructed in a central location, serves as
the focal point of the forgathering. The campfire burns all night and day,
continually tended and fed deadfall logs. At any hour, rangers can be found
crowding around the camp fire, roasting meat and exchanging stories.
