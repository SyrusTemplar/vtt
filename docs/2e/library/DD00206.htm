There are no absolute rules to define a too-powerful character, since the
definition will vary from campaign to campaign. Characters who are average in your
game may be weaklings in your friend's campaign. His characters, in turn, could
be frail compared to other groups. Some experience is required to strike the
right balance of power, but characters created using the same method should, at
least, be comparable.
<P></P>
When someone brings a character from a different campaign and wants to use him
in your game, compare the proposed character to those already in the game. You
don't want him to be too strong or too weak. Certainly you should be wary of a
character whose ability scores are all 18s!
