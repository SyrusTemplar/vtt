This spell enables the wizard to magically call into being a sturdy cottage or
lodge, made of material that is common in the area where the spell is
cast--stone, timber, or (at worst) sod. The floor area of the lodging is 30 square feet
per level of the spellcaster, and the surface is level, clean, and dry. In all
respects the lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two or
more shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.
<P></P>
While the lodging is secure against winds of up to 70 miles per hour, it has
no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities).
Therefore, it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects
it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security
otherwise, as it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its
material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone,
and is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege machinery or
giants).
<P></P>
The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former
two being wizard locked and the latter being secured by a top grate of iron and
a narrow flue. In addition, these three areas are protected by an <I>alarm</I> spell. Lastly, an unseen servant is conjured to provide service to the
spellcaster.
<P></P>
The inside of the shelter contains rude furnishings as desired by the
spellcaster--up to eight bunks, a trestle table and benches, as many as four chairs or
eight stools, and a writing desk.
<P></P>
The material components of this spell are a square chip of stone, crushed
lime, a few grains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and several splinters of wood.
These must be augmented by the components of the <I>alarm</I> and <I>unseen servant</I> spells if these benefits are to be included (string and silver wire and a
small bell).
