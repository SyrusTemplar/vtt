The<I> fire seeds</I> spell creates special missiles or timed incendiaries that burn with great
heat. The spell can be cast to create either fire seed missiles or fire seed
incendiaries, as chosen when the spell is cast.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fire seed missiles:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This casting turns up to four acorns into special grenadelike missiles that
can be hurled up to 40 yards. An attack roll is required to strike the intended
target, and proficiency penalties are considered. Each acorn bursts upon
striking any hard surface, causing 2d8 points of damage and igniting any combustible
materials within a 10-foot diameter of the point of impact. If a successful
saving throw vs. spell is made, a creature within the burst area receives only
one-half damage, but a creature struck directly suffers full damage (i.e., no
saving throw).
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fire seed incendiaries:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This casting turns up to eight holly berries into special incendiaries. The
holly berries are most often placed, being too light to make effective missiles.
They can be tossed only up to 6 feet away. They burst into flame if the caster
is within 40 yards and speaks a word of command. The berries instantly ignite,
causing 1d8 points of damage to any creature and igniting any combustible
within a 5-foot-diameter burst area. Creatures within the area that successfully
save vs. spell suffer half damage.
<P></P>
All fire seeds lose their power after a duration equal to one turn per
experience level of the caster--e.g., the seeds of a 13th-level caster remain potent
for a maximum of 13 turns after their creation.
<P></P>
No other material components beyond acorns or holly berries are needed for
this spell.
