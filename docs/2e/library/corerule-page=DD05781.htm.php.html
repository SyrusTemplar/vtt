This proficiency serves two functions. First, it allows the character to pose
convincingly as a beggar; success is automatic, so no proficiency check needs
to be made. This function is used most by Assassins, Bounty Hunters and Spies in
the pursuit of their assignments.
<P></P>
A character can also use begging to procure a very minimal daily income. (Many
Cutpurses are in fact beggars who aren't getting enough—and vice versa.)
Success requires first that there be people to beg from—people with money to give. A
character in an abandoned castle or a recently pillaged village are virtually
assured of failure.
<P></P>
The following modifiers are suggested to the DM as guidelines. They do not
consider the wealth of a locale, just the population density. Impoverished regions
might have greater negative modifiers—but then, so might affluent areas with
traditions of stinginess.

If a proficiency check is successful, then a character is able to panhandle
enough money, goods or services that day to meet his basic needs (a little food
and drink, a place to sleep).
<P></P>
The DM may also use the proficiency check for specific single actions—e.g., a
character in disguise as a beggar accosts a specific NPC.
<P></P>
The begging proficiency may not be used to force player characters to give
money away; players are always free to decide if and how generous their characters
are in response to supplications.
