This is a god of common sense. Wisdom is distinct from, though normally
compatible with, formal education and conventional learning; but it is not the same.
It consists merely of having sense enough to know what it otherwise takes
experience or an education to learn. The learned man knows from experience when his
words will provoke a fight; the wise man knows it intuitively, instinctively.
<P></P>
The priests of this god promote sensible solutions and actions on the part of
the flock. They suggest compromises and alternatives. They plan future events.
The look for trouble in upcoming events and try to head it off. But this isn't
a god of peace, and so the priests of wisdom will often be advisors to military
officers, helping them plan effective strategies.
