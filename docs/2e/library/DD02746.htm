<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The armorer's craft evolved over the course of thousands of years, much as
weapons evolved. The marvelous works of the German and Italian master armorers of
the 15th century simply cannot be duplicated by craftsmen with more primitive
technology. Therefore, armor is limited by time period just as weapons are.
<P></P>
The following descriptions note the adjusted base AC for a full suit of each
armor type, and also a generic encumbrance value for typical humans in that
armor. Player characters may accept these encumbrance values or use the more
advanced encumbrance rules to total up their equipment weight.
<P></P>
The <A HREF="DD02740.htm#9e53bbbc"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02740.htm#9e53bbbc">armor table</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> also includes protective values for pieces of armor. In most cases, these are
fractional-for example, a chain mail arm piece improves the wearer's AC by
0.5. For most PCs, this reduces the wearer from an AC of 10, so if a composite
suit of armor improves the character's AC by 3.9 points, his actual Armor Class is
a 6.1 (10?3.9), which rounds down to an AC of 6. Only round to the lower AC if
the fraction is .3 or less; an AC of 6.1 is a 6, but a 6.4, 6.5, or 6.9 is
considered to actually be AC 7.
<P></P>
Partial armor can always be bypassed by the use of the called shot rules <A HREF="DD02482.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02482.htm">in Chapter Two</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">. The attacker suffers a ?4 penalty for making a called shot, but of course he
gets to make his attack against the defender's unprotected AC of 10. The best
use for partial armor in the game is to simulate various forms of composite
protection favored in different time periods; for example, medieval infantry often
wore breastplates and helmets but did not wear armor on their legs or arms.
<P></P>
Last but not least, armors are loosely grouped into three basic types-plate
armors, mail armors, and leather armors. Some weapons gain special attack bonuses
against certain types of armor. For example, the heavy blow of a mace is
especially effective against mailed opponents, because the flexibility of the mail
allows the blow to cause damage even through thick armor.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02991385"></A><B>Back-and-breast. </B>(AC 6; enc. none; type plate) This armor is simply a steel breastplate and
back piece, worn like a shirt. It protects the wearer's vital organs but leaves
the limbs uncovered. Historically it saw use throughout the Renaissance.
<P></P>
<A NAME="e85921cc"></A><B>Banded mail.</B> (AC 4; enc. light; type mail) There is some debate over the existence of this
armor in the Middle Ages, but Roman legionaries wore banded breastplates as
part of the<I> lorica segmenta.</I> Banded mail consists of parallel bands or strips of armor covering the torso,
shoulders, arms, and legs, with mail guarding the joints.
<P></P>
<A NAME="932879d7"></A><B>Brigandine. </B>(AC 6; enc. none; type leather) A very common armor of the later Middle Ages
and the east, brigandine consisted of a coat of leather plates. Each leather
plate was a sandwich with steel strips inside of it. The joints and limbs were
constructed with fewer armor strips for flexibility. Splinted mail, described
below, is nothing more than a heavier version of brigandine.
<P></P>
<A NAME="fceb905d"></A><B>Bronze plate mail.</B> (AC 4; enc. light; type plate) This armor never existed as a full suit
historically. However, bronze breastplates, greaves, and arm guards were quite
common, especially in Greek and early Roman settings. With a full suit of bronze
plate mail, the underlying chain mail backing that is found in normal steel plate
mail is replaced by backing made of studded leather.
<P></P>
<A NAME="c64c43f2"></A><B>Buckler.</B> The smallest shield used is the buckler. It is usually not more than a foot
in diameter. Its small size makes it easy to carry, but it is of limited
usefulness against anything except fencing weapons. The buckler's AC bonus can only be
counted against the attacks of a single opponent in any combat round.
<P></P>
<A NAME="00008c36"></A><B>Cap.</B> Steel, bronze, or iron caps are among the most common helmets until the later
days of the Crusades. A cap is often worn over a mail coif for additional
protection; the two together provide an AC of 3 for the user's head and neck. Caps
often include nasals, or projecting bars, that cover the user's nose.
<P></P>
<A NAME="f1b06dd8"></A><B>Chain hauberk.</B> (AC 6; enc. light; type mail) Chain mail was first constructed in Roman times
as shirts or skirts. Throughout the Dark Ages mail was reserved only for the
wealthiest warriors. By the end of the Dark Ages, the most common form of mail
was the hauberk, a long-sleeved coat that hung to the wearer's knees. Because
the lower legs are vulnerable, the hauberk doesn-t offer the same protection that
a full suit of chain mail does.
<P></P>
<A NAME="e5d7cb63"></A><B>Chain mail.</B> (AC 5; enc. light; type mail) The full suit of chain mail appeared early in
the Crusades, when chain leggings were added to the traditional hauberk. For
more than a century mail was the universally favored form of protection in Western
Europe and the Holy Land; armor experts refer to the 11th and 12th centuries
as the Age of Mail.
<P></P>
<A NAME="79c94d32"></A><B>Chain-lamellar.</B> (AC 4; enc. light; type mail) Chain mail was used widely in Byzantium and
eastern lands, too. It was common for eastern peoples to augment their lighter
mail with heavier armor. Chain mail with lamellar breastplates, greaves, and arm
guards was widely used by Byzantine, Turkish, and Persian cavalry.
<P></P>
<A NAME="d3f88d39"></A><B>Close-faced helm.</B> This category includes a number of variations, ranging from steel war masks,
to the Crusaders? barrel helms, to samurai helmets. The helmet offers excellent
protection, but is heavy and can limit vision and hearing. In situations where
field of view or clarity of hearing may be important, the DM can impose a ?1
penalty to surprise checks for characters wearing close-faced helms.
<P></P>
<A NAME="731195bc"></A><B>Cord armor.</B> (AC 8; enc. none; type leather) Only found in savage or exotic settings, cord
armor consists of rope-like fibers woven and knotted into a thick, tough
fabric. It may be found in places where leather is scarce.
<P></P>
<A NAME="364d1613"></A><B>Field plate.</B> (AC 2; enc. moderate; type plate) The armorer's craft reached its peak during
the Renaissance, when full suits of articulated plate armor were common. Field
plate armor dispenses with the chain backing of plate mail or full plate armor
to save weight. Instead, a light suit of padding, or <I>aketon</I>, would be worn beneath field plate. The considerable weight of this armor was
distributed over the wearer's body, and a trained knight could lie down, stand
up, or vault into the saddle while wearing heavy armor.
<P></P>
<A NAME="9ee73764"></A><B>Full plate.</B> (AC 1; enc. moderate; type plate) The final development of armor was full
plate armor, which protected the wearer with padding, chain, and a suit of
beautifully crafted interlocking plates carefully angled to deflect blows. Armor of
this type could even withstand long-range gunfire, as long as the bullet didn-t
strike square on target. A well-made suit of full plate armor was the sign of
high nobility; many lesser knights had to make do with far less impressive suits
due to the great expense of this marvelous armor.
<P></P>
<A NAME="44512d56"></A><B>Gallic armor.</B> (AC 8; enc. none; type leather) Reserved for the gladiatorial arena, Gallic
armor consisted of leather leggings and a leather sleeve, with a wide metal
belt. No free soldier would normally wear such light armor if better could be found.
<P></P>
<A NAME="0966ba86"></A><B>Great helm.</B> The great helm actually sits on a metal gorget, or throat-guard, instead of
resting its weight on the wearer's head. The face is completely covered. The
protection offered by the great helm is unmatched, but the wearer's visibility and
hearing are seriously impaired; he suffers a ?2 penalty to any surprise checks
that might be affected by his ability to spot his enemy or hear someone
sneaking up on him.
<P></P>
<A NAME="49e5d9f0"></A><B>Half-plate.</B> (AC 4; enc. light; type plate) As firearms became more prevalent, the
usefulness of heavy plate armor rapidly declined. The trend towards more complete
coverage reversed, and soldiers and knights began to discard all but the most
critical pieces of armor. Half-plate consists of a breastplate and tassets, or hip
armor, but the lower legs are left unarmored, as are the insides of the arms.
Half-plate lingered on into the 17th century before disappearing altogether.
<P></P>
<A NAME="001dd5ca"></A><B>Hide.</B> (AC 6; enc. light; type leather) Hide armors were rare in Western Europe, but
saw some limited use in eastern settings. At the DM's option, hide armor can
be used to simulate the buff coat-a Renaissance armor made of several layers of
stiffened leather.
<P></P>
<A NAME="19f7232d"></A><B>Hoplite armor.</B> (AC 5; enc. light; type plate) The armor of the classic Greek warrior
consisted of a bronze breastplate and greaves with a studded leather skirt. It offered
a good compromise of protection for vital areas without too much weight.
Alexander's soldiers conquered half the world in armor like this.
<P></P>
<A NAME="98c4b4ec"></A><B>Improved mail.</B> (AC 4; enc. light; type mail) Several varieties of improved chain mail
appeared during the Crusades. Bar mail consisted of small metal strips threaded
through the links; double mail used heavier links double-joined; augmented mail used
a thick leather backing to reinforce the coat. All types of improved mail
offer better protection than normal chain mail, but at the price of increased
weight.
<P></P>
<A NAME="1613e6ce"></A><B>Lamellar.</B> (AC 5; enc. light; type mail) Lamellar armor consists of small, overlapping
plates of metal sewn together or stitched to a backing of leather or cloth. It
is similar to brigandine and splinted mail, but isn-t sandwiched in leather like
the other two armors. Lamellar is a very ancient armor that was used in
Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt thousands of years before the rise of Rome. Byzantine
and Persian cavalrymen used breastplates of steel lamellar as part of their
heavy armor.
<P></P>
<A NAME="3f996163"></A><B>Lamellar shirt.</B> (AC 7; enc. none; type mail) Full suits of lamellar armor were very rare in
the Bronze Age, but lamellar coats with cloth skirts were somewhat more common.
This composite armor represents the best protection available to the common
soldier in extremely ancient settings.
<P></P>
<A NAME="f18f7541"></A><B>Leather.</B> (AC 8; enc. none; type leather) Leather armor has been used by light troops
since the Bronze Age. Leather can be toughened by treating it with oil in a
process known as <I>cuir boilli.</I> This armor type uses cuir boilli pieces to reinforce vital areas and soft
leather for the legs and arms.
<P></P>
<A NAME="e7c376be"></A><B>Leather helm.</B> The lightest helm available is made from cuir boilli leather reinforced by
iron or bronze bands. The leather helm doesn-t provide much protection compared
to other types, but it's better than nothing.
<P></P>
<A NAME="60f405ff"></A><B>Light scale.</B> (AC 7; enc. none; type leather) Normal scale armor is made out of iron,
bronze, or steel, but it's also possible to make scale armor out of cuir boilli
leather scales, bone, or horn. Light scale is often the armor of nomadic or savage
peoples who have difficulty finding metal to work with.
<P></P>
<A NAME="974fbf5f"></A><B>Lorica hamata.</B> (AC 6; enc. none; type mail) This Roman armor consisted of a chain mail shirt
and a skirt of leather reinforced with bronze or iron strips. It was an early
armor used from the time of the Punic Wars into the 1st century a.d.
<P></P>
<A NAME="ba171c1b"></A><B>Lorica segmenta. </B>(AC 5; enc. none; type mail) Lorica segmenta replaced lorica hamata and was
used until about a.d. 350. It consists of a breastplate of banded mail and a
reinforced skirt of studded leather armor.
<P></P>
<A NAME="6b7a1b9b"></A><B>Mail coif. </B>The mail coif is a hood of chain mail that drapes over the neck and shoulders
as well as the head. It is usually worn with a cap or beneath another helmet,
since chain mail by itself doesn-t offer much protection against impact weapons.
If worn with a cap, the mail coif is AC 4; if worn under another helmet, it
provides no additional protection but at least allows the user to remove his
restrictive helmet and get a look around without baring his head completely.
<P></P>
<A NAME="3813c852"></A><B>Mail and plate. </B>(AC 4; enc. light; type plate) Plate armor first appeared near the end of the
Crusades as reinforcement for chain mail armor. Small breastplates were
introduced first, but rapidly grew into full breastplates with complete leg and arm
covering. The mail and plate armor describes an early form of plate mail in which
a breastplate is worn over a full suit of chainmail.
<P></P>
<A NAME="85985e53"></A><B>Open-faced helm. </B>Greek and Roman helmets normally fell under this category, as did many helmets
of the later Middle Ages. The open-faced helm provides good protection and
only moderately compromises vision and hearing. This category also includes the
Renaissance morion, kettle helm, lobster-tail, and other such helmets.
<P></P>
<A NAME="1bf524ac"></A><B>Padded. </B>(AC 8; enc. none; type leather) Padded or quilted armor is probably one of the
oldest and most universal forms of personal defense. Even in the days of full
plate armors, padded suits known as aketons were worn beneath the steel plate
to cushion blows and help distribute the weight of the outer armor. Light troops
of many time periods are often equipped with padded armor.
<P></P>
<A NAME="c3022da6"></A><B>Plate mail. </B>(AC 3; enc. mod; type plate) This is the cheapest and most common form of
plate armor in the Middle Ages. Instead of attempting to articulate the joints and
provide complete plate protection, portions of this armor are simply protected
with chain mail. This form of armor was nothing more than an expanded suit of
mail and plate, and the forerunner of true plate armor. Even in the age of full
plate armor, simple plate mail was still common among poorer knights and
professional mercenaries.
<P></P>
<A NAME="c3f74ca4"></A><B>Ring mail. </B>(AC 7; enc. none; type leather) Ring mail consists of a leather coat with
rings sewn onto it. It slightly resembles chain mail, but the links do not
interlock. In the Dark Ages, ring mail was a cheap substitute for true mail, which was
too expensive for many warriors. Some varieties of ring mail were used
throughout the Middle Ages by light troops, artillerists, and skirmishers.
<P></P>
<A NAME="87d227d6"></A><B>Scale mail. </B>(AC 6, enc. light, type mail) This ancient armor type consists of a leather
coat or shirt with scales of metal riveted to it. (Some forms of scale mail were
made with horn or leather-see <A HREF="DD02746.htm#60f405ff"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02746.htm#60f405ff">Light Scale</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.) Scale mail was never widely used in the West, but saw extensive use in the
Mideast and Orient.
<P></P>
<A NAME="8cce1e13"></A><B>Shield, small. </B>The small shield, or <I>targe</I>, is usually a round shield about two feet in diameter. Some later medieval
shields were triangular or square in shape. The small shield can be used against
two enemies in a combat round, as long as they are in front of the character or
on his shielded flank.
<P></P>
<A NAME="706e40f5"></A><B>Shield, medium. </B>This catch-all category includes anything from the Roman <I>scutum </I>to the Norman kite shield. It usually stands about three feet tall and is two
to three feet wide. The medium shield can protect the wielder from up to three
enemies per round, as long as they are in front of the character or on his
shielded flank.
<P></P>
<A NAME="8b52de43"></A><B>Shield, large.</B> Also known as the body shield or tower shield, this mighty shield stands at
least four feet tall and is two to three feet wide. It can protect the wielder
against any attack from his front or shielded flank.
<P></P>
<A NAME="8d50db28"></A><B>Splint mail. </B>(AC 4; enc. light; type mail) Splinted armor resembles brigandine, but larger
metal strips are used. The metal strips are riveted together in an overlapping
pattern and then enclosed in two layers of leather. Splinted armor was not
widely used in Western Europe, but was popular in India and the Far East. The <I>o-yoroi</I> of the samurai can be considered to be splint mail.
<P></P>
<A NAME="7c040eef"></A><B>Studded leather.</B> (AC 7; enc. none; type leather) Reinforcing leather with metal studs or small
plates is an old idea; armor of this type has been used since the Bronze Age.
It was still common among foot soldiers even as late as the Renaissance.
<P></P>
<A NAME="0642180a"></A><B>Three-quarter plate. </B>(AC 3; enc. light; type plate) Like half-plate, three-quarter plate appeared
when knights began to discard the less important pieces of their armor. There-s
little point in carrying around 70 pounds of armor when it won-t stop a bullet
or a heavy crossbow bolt. Three-quarter plate retains the breastplate, arm
protection, hips, and thigh plates but dispenses with protection for the lower legs
and inner part of the thighs, which would normally be protected by the horse.
<P></P>
<A NAME="32649104"></A><B>Wood or bone armor. </B>(AC 7; enc. none; type leather) In primitive or savage settings, metal may be
unavailable for armor. Wood or bone lamellars and reinforced coats are not
uncommon among people with little access to metal. Usually, armor of this type
concentrates on protecting the torso while leaving the arms and legs free for
mobility.

Warriors have been looking for ways to armor their mounts almost as long as
they-ve been armoring themselves. It doesn-t take a genius to figure out that an
unarmored horse might be an easier target than the heavily plated knight who-s
riding it. Therefore, characters who plan on riding their horses into battle
should try to acquire barding.

The AC <I>replaces</I> the mount's natural Armor Class, if the barding AC is better than the
animal's normal AC. If the animal's AC is better than the barding, then the barding
simply improves the animal's AC by the number in parentheses.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I> For example, horses have a natural AC of 7. Scale, chain, and plate barding
replace their natural AC. Since leather and padded armors don-t provide an AC
better than 7, they simply lower the horse's AC to 6 or 5, respectively.

<A NAME="5ea6a3da"></A><B>Leather scale barding. </B>This barding dates back to the Bronze Age, but also saw use in Roman times and
the Dark Ages. It consists of a leather blanket with cuir boilli scales sewn
onto it.

<B>Padded barding. </B>Often used by Crusaders, this light armor also allows a knight to display his
colors on his mount.
<P></P>
<B>Scale barding. </B>The best barding available until the Hundred Years? War is scale barding. It
consists of a coat sewn with metal scales. Scale barding was used by the princes
and kings of the Bronze Age.

<A NAME="1c6464a9"></A><B>Chain barding. </B>Only the strongest horses can carry an armored knight and a heavy coat of
mail, too. Chain barding was not very common because of its expense and weight.
<P></P>
<B>Plate and chain barding. </B>The best armor available for horses came into use towards the end of the
Hundred Years? War. The horse's forequarters, flanks, head, and neck are protected
by steel plates, and loose chain skirts cover the rest. Like chain barding,
plate barding is very heavy and very expensive. It would normally only be found on
the mount of a great knight or prince.
