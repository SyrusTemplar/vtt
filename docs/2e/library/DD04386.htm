According to one view of the universe, what we perceive as gravity is actually
a localized warping of the fabric of space-time. The <I>spacewarp</I> spell creates a temporary but very intense warping in a limited area.
<P></P>
When the priest casts this spell, he selects a specific point to be the center
of effect. This point may be anywhere within 50 yards of the caster, including
in midair.
<P></P>
When the spell is completed, this center of effect gains a gravity field equal
to the force felt at the surface of the earth. In other words, gravity is
centered at this point; everything within 50 feet of this center that is not
attached to something immovable will fall toward the selected point.
<P></P>
This localized gravity affects only loose objects and creatures capable of
movement (i.e., not trees, whose roots are buried in the ground). It does not
affect the ground itself--soil, plants, desert sand, lake water, etc. are immune to
the effect.
<P></P>
An object falling toward the center of gravity gains speed exactly as it would
if it were falling toward the ground. When the object reaches the center, it
instantly ceases its movement. If objects are already at the center, newly
arriving objects will slam into them, causing normal falling damage (1d6 per 10
feet) to the newly arriving objects. Objects previously at the center must save vs.
paralyzation or suffer half that amount of damage.
<P></P>
Consider the following example. An orc is 10 feet away from the center of
effect when the spell is cast. He falls 10 feet to the center and stops. His
companion, a bandit, is 30 feet from the center. It takes him longer to fall to the
center, so the orc is already there when he arrives, and the two characters
collide forcefully. The bandit suffers 3d6 hit points of damage--the falling damage
associated with a 30-foot fall. The orc must save vs. paralyzation or suffer
half that amount.
<P></P>
Other things are caught in the effect as well. The bandit's horse was 50 feet
away from the center of effect, so it arrives at the center after the orc and
the bandit. It falls 50 feet, suffering 5d6 points of damage, and potentially
inflicting half that amount on both the orc and the bandit.
<P></P>
The center of effect can be anywhere within 50 yards of the priest. Possibly
one of the most destructive uses of this spell is to cast it directly on an
enemy creature. Everyone and everything within 50 feet of that creature falls
toward him and strikes him, inflicting damage.
<P></P>
When the spell terminates, gravity returns to normal. If the spell has lifted
any characters or objects off the ground, they immediately fall back to the
ground, suffering the appropriate amount of falling damage.
<P></P>
The material components are a lodestone and a sphere of obsidian, both of
which are consumed in the casting.
