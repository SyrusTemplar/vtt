</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The elegantly evil race of dark elves make perfect candidates for
necromancers. Unlike their surface- dwelling cousins, the drow embrace death and necromancy
to the very core of their mainstream society, enshrined in the worship of
their sinister mother-goddess Lolth. Wizardry is one of the few avenues for male
advancement and prestige in the matriarchal theocracy of the dark elves.
Necromancy is a popular school of magic among drow specialists (others favorites
include invocation and alteration). Drow necromancers adopt either the Archetype,
Philosopher, or Undead Master kits.
<P></P>
The dark elves are unquestionably a magically talented race. Even the most
mundane citizen has innate magic resistance and some sort of minimal talent with
wizardry, so it perhaps not surprising that they can advance as far as humans in
this regard. Certainly, every drow city can boast of at least one archmage
capable of casting the most powerful spells.
<P></P>
All drow wizards (necromancers included) either operate strictly within the
matriarchal confines of their society or live completely outside them. Those drow
who remain in their own communities emerge into outer layers of the Underdark
(or more rarely, to the surface) only for training or war parties. Wizards
chosen for these missions are thus rarely more powerful than 9th to 11th level of
experience (and usually far weaker).
<P></P>
The most powerful drow necromancers place themselves above such petty tasks,
residing exclusively in subterranean cities where they serve the constantly
broiling, internecine quarrels relished by the various noble houses. The most
powerful wizards, who choose to remain above the political maneuvering, still must
serve the community by teaching in the colleges of sorcery. These institutions
play a fundamental role in the training of young drow warriors and priests.
<P></P>
To question their role in the female hierarchy spells certain disaster for
male drow wizards. The priesthood ruthlessly twists any progressive free thinkers
into hideous driders. These half-arachnid, half-drow monstrosities retain their
former command of necromancy and are usually between the 6th and 8th level in
experience.
<P></P>
Those lucky enough to escape such punishment flee deep into the bowels of the
Underdark, forsaking all protection by their house and society. Life as a rogue
mage is far from easy. The priesthood sends relentless war parties to
eliminate such mavericks lest their example be emulated by others, and the horrific
denizens of the Underdark can be much less than hospitable to a single, traveling
drow. Rogue necromancers among the drow must therefore be extremely powerful
and resourceful in order to survive alone for long in the harsh environment (at
least 12th level).
