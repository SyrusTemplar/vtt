<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
   The ranger has undergone several changes since the publication of the 1st
Edition AD&amp;D® rules. For that reason, those using the 1st Edition rules may find
the ranger character described in these pages all but unrecognizable. Our
suggestions: (1) take the plunge into the 2nd Edition rules, and become familiar with
the 2nd Edition <I>DUNGEON MASTER Guide</I> and <I>Player's Handbook</I> before considering the ideas in this handbook, or (2) ignore the chapter
references in this book, as they all refer to the 2nd Edition rulebooks. Find the
relevant material by consulting the indexes or contents pages of the original
books, then carefully adapt the handbook rules of your choice to the style of
your campaign. For reference, a summary of the 1st Edition ranger rules can be
found in the Appendix of this book on page 122.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
   The ideas in this book lean heavily on the concepts of weapon and nonweapon
proficiencies introduced in Chapter 5 of the 2nd Edition<I> Player's Handbook</I>. If you haven't been using proficiencies in your campaign, we suggest you
review the rules before proceeding with this book. (And if you're not using the
proficiency rules, you ought to reconsider—they're not that hard, and they make
the game a lot more fun!).

<B>A Note About Pronouns</B>
<P></P>
  
<P></P>
For convenience and clarity, masculine pronouns are used throughout this book.
This in no way implies favoritism towards the male gender; in fact, males and
females are equally represented in the ranger population. In all cases, read <I>he</I> as <I>he</I> or <I>she</I>, and <I>his</I> as <I>his</I> and <I>her</I>.
