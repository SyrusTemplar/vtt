Most fantasy cultures tends to fall into one of the following categories:
<P></P>
<P></P>
Monotheistic By Demand
<P></P>
Monotheistic By Dogma
<P></P>
Pantheistic, Chief Faith Dominant By Charisma
<P></P>
Pantheistic, Chief Faith Dominant By Strength
<P></P>
Pantheistic, No Chief Faith
<P></P>
<P></P>
Here's what those terms mean within a campaign.
<P></P>
<B>Monotheistic By Demand:</B> The faith's god acknowledges that there are other gods, but demands that
everyone worship him or her alone and not those other gods. If a culture is
Monotheistic By Demand, it means that this one faith is the only one legally permitted
within the culture. This faith is able to demand a tithe (discussed earlier in
this chapter) of its followers.
<P></P>
<B>Monotheistic By Dogma:</B> Whether it is true or not, the faith claims that there is only one god or
goddess and that everyone must worship that one being. If a culture is
Monotheistic By Dogma, only the one faith is permitted within the culture. Typically, the
worshippers are sufficiently inflexible in their belief that they often
participate in religious wars in order to extend the domination of their own faith or
suppress faiths they consider dangerous or heretical. This faith is able to
demand a tithe of its followers.
<P></P>
<B>Pantheistic, Chief Faith Dominant By Charisma:</B> This culture concedes that there are several gods with individual faiths or
cults associated with them. One, however, is the special favorite of the
population, because they consider that god's attribute, personality, or blessings
superior to any other god's. Most citizens of the culture worship this chief god
and any other gods they choose. In this type of culture, the dominant faith
typically asks but is unable to demand a tithe of its followers.
<P></P>
<B>Pantheistic, Chief Faith Dominant By Strength:</B> This culture concedes that there are several gods with individual faiths or
cults associated with them. One, however, is supreme in power, either because it
has a strong hold on the culture's ruling aristocracy or because the chief god
has a power or promises rewards that make his worship necessary. (For example,
even in a culture where many gods are worshipped, the god who decides how each
person's afterlife is to be spent could be the dominant god; or the king of
the gods, who rules the god of the afterlife, could instead be dominant.) In this
type of culture, the dominant faith is able to demand a tithe of its
followers.
<P></P>
<B>Pantheistic, No Chief Faith:</B> This culture concedes that there are several gods with individual faiths or
cults associated with them. Though individual cults may be stronger or weaker
than each other, none is dominant throughout the culture. Each faith can only
ask, not demand, a tithe of its worshippers. Within the culture, individual <I>communities</I> may have dominant gods; and within those individual communities only, the
chief god's worship will correspond to one of the &quot;Pantheistic, Chief Faith
Dominant By Charisma&quot; or &quot;Pantheistic, Chief Faith Dominant By Strength&quot; categories.
Some cities will not have dominant gods, or may have two or more dominant gods
who have joint worship here but not elsewhere. All the gods worshipped within
the culture will be perceived to belong to the same family, or pantheon, of gods.
