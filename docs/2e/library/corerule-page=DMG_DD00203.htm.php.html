</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> This gives players more control over their characters than the other methods.
A points system makes it quite likely that a player can get the character he
wants--or at least the class and race. However, in doing so the player must make
some serious compromises.

It is unlikely that his dice are going to be good enough to make every score
as high as he would like. In all likelihood, only one or two ability scores will
be exceptional, and miserable dice rolling could lower this even further. The
player must carefully weigh the pros and cons of his choices when creating the
character.
