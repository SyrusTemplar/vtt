<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> A god of stern defense and aggressive watchfulness, Arvoreen is the patron of
watchful diligence, not war. He is more serious than the typical halfling (or
halfling deity) and serves as a reminder that the safety they currently enjoy
was hard-won and can be easily lost.

Avatar: Arvoreen appears as a handsome young halfling warrior, muscular of
build and generally very lightly clothed. He commonly carries a short sword and
often a gleaming metal shield.
