Though they generally avoid organizations and communal events, many rangers
participate in informal get-togethers called <I>forgatherings</I> or moots. At forgatherings, rangers can exchange ideas, barter for supplies,
and participate in contests of skill, as well as catch up on gossip and blow
off steam. Attendance at forgatherings is by no means mandatory, but most rangers
look forward to the opportunity to spend a few days socializing with others
who share the same general philosophy and professional challenges.

?? These are often times of much merriment and celebration. Old friends are
greeted warmly and new rangers are initiated, sometimes with raucous practical
joking. There are food and fun for all, and tests of skill and prowess to pass the
time and take each other's measure.
