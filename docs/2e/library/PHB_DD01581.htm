<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Mountaineering:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A character with this proficiency can make difficult and dangerous climbs up
steep slopes and cliffs with the aid of spikes, ropes, etc. If a character with
mountaineering proficiency leads a party, placing the pitons (spikes) and
guiding the others, all in the party can gain the benefit of his knowledge. A
mountaineer can guide a party up a cliff face it could not otherwise climb. A
character with this proficiency gains a 10% bonus per proficiency slot spent to his
chance to climb any surface. Note that mountaineering is not the same as the
thief's climbing ability, since the latter does not require aids of any sort.
