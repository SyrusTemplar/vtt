When the plane shift spell is cast, the priest moves himself or some other
creature to another plane of existence. The recipient of the spell remains in the
new plane until sent forth by some like means. If several persons link hands in
a circle, up to eight can be affected by the plane shift at the same time.
<P></P>
The material component of this spell is a small, forked metal rod. The size
and metal type dictates to which plane of existence, including sub-planes and
alternate dimensions, the spell sends the affected creatures. The DM will
determine specifics regarding how and what planes are reached.
<P></P>
An unwilling victim must be touched (successful attack roll) to be sent. In
addition, the creature is also allowed a saving throw. If the saving throw is
successful, the effect of the spell is negated. Note that pinpoint accuracy is
rarely achieved; arriving at a random distance from an intended destination is
common.
<P></P>
The metal rod is not expended when the spell is cast. Forked rods keyed to
certain planes may be difficult to come by, as decided by the DM.
