If a character already has multiple attacks in a round, he can still perform
the Hold Attack maneuver with any or all of his attacks. This can make things a
little complicated, but it's not a lot of trouble.
<P></P>
<I>Example: In this fight, Rathnar the Barbarian (who has one attack per round),
Drusilla the Spear-Maiden (who has two per round), and Lacksley the Archer (who
has three per two, and has two this round) are fighting a jungle warrior (two
attacks per round) and his monstrous jaguar ally (three attacks per round).
<P></P>
This round, Lacksley wants to shoot the jaguar; but he's still caught in a
spring-loaded animal trap, and Drusilla is between him and the jaguar.
<P></P>
The player-characters win initiative. Drusilla uses her first attack to spear
the jungle warrior. Rathnar uses his sole attack to swing his axe at the jaguar
monster. Lacksley announces that he's holding his maneuver. Now it's time for
the monsters to respond; the jungle warrior attacks Drusilla with his own
spear, and the jaguar-monster jumps on Rathnar and uses one of its two paw hits.
<P></P>
It's time for secondary maneuvers. Drusilla misses her second strike. Rathnar
has no second strike. It's time for Lacksley to act. He asks the DM if Drusilla
has moved out of position yet, and the DM rules that she has. He fires,
scoring a hit on the jaguar monster. The jungle warrior stabs Drusilla again with his
second strike, and the jaguar latches hold of Rathnar with his second paw
strike.
<P></P>
It's time for tertiary maneuvers. Lacksley, because of his Hold Attack
maneuver, now takes what would have been his secondary maneuver. He shoots the jaguar
again, killing it; it rolls off Rathnar before it can inflict its third attack,
a deadly bite or an even more deadly rake.
