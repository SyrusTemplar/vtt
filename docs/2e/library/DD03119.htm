<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Clumsy:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The character with this disadvantage has the unfortunate habit of dropping
things, tripping, or knocking things over at inopportune times. The DM will
occasionally require the character to make a Dexterity check. Failure means the
character loses his grip, stumbles, or trips. The check can be required as often as
the DM desires, though as a general rule two or three times a gaming session
probably will be adequate.
