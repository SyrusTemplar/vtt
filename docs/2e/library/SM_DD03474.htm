<FONT SIZE="4"><FONT COLOR="PURPLE">Priest Proficiencies </FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Like
wizards, priests acquire a variety of nonweapon proficiencies over
the course of their careers. More than any other character, a priest
is likely to find a use for common or everyday skills. In fact, in
many cultures, priests are the principal teachers, scholars, or
craftsmen of their societies. Priests have a nonweapon proficiency
progression that equals that of a wizard, but gain weapon skills much faster.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">In this section, we&#146;ll take a look at some new
priest proficiencies. These should be considered addenda to the <FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="PHB_DD01538.htm">Table
37</A></FONT> : Nonweapon Proficiency Groups in the <I>Player&#146;s Handbook</I>.

<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="RED"><B>Administration: </B></FONT>Many
temples own substantial amounts of land and property, wielding power
over vast areas. Priests who can manage these lands and turn a tidy
profit in the name of the church are always in demand. A character
with this proficiency is skilled in the management and accounting of
enterprises ranging from the agriculture of an entire province to the
vineyards of a single small monastery. He knows how to account for
money, plan work, and supervise the collection of taxes or the sale
of goods.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="RED"><B>Alms: </B></FONT>Some orders of
priests rely on the charity of others for their support and
livelihood. A character with this proficiency is able to find food,
shelter, and clothing in return for the benefit of his wisdom and a
blessing or two for his hosts. The quality of the charity the priest
finds may vary widely, depending on the wealth of his prospective
hosts, their piety and their recognition of his deity, and the way
the priest presents himself. Generally, if there&#146;s shelter to be
had, the priest can make use of it, but obtaining food or clothing
for his companions may require a nonweapon proficiency check at the
DM&#146;s discretion.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><A NAME="dcd8eb98"></A></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="RED"><B>Bureaucracy: </B></FONT>This
proficiency encompasses a working knowledge of temple or government
organization and protocol, and the skills necessary to navigate
through bureaucracies. The character knows which officials to
approach and when to approach them, where records are kept and how to
gain access to them, and how to circumvent unfriendly or sluggish
bureaucrats. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, the
character can get permits or documents completed in half the normal time.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">In addition to these skills, the character can attempt
to turn the system against someone else. With a successful
proficiency check, the amount of time required to make a decision
doubles&#151;permits are misplaced or filled out incorrectly, or
important documents are held up on the wrong desk. For example, a
character could keep a shady wizard from gaining permission to build
a tower in the town, or he might obstruct a thief&#146;s request for
bond or parole.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><A NAME="2e335404"></A></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="RED"><B>Ceremony: </B></FONT>A priest
with this proficiency is well-versed in the various rites,
observances, and ceremonies of his temple. He is qualified to oversee
normal worship or devotions, but conducting the rites in difficult or
unusual situations may require a proficiency check. This proficiency
also includes familiarity with ceremonies such as weddings, namings,
and funerals, and the priest can perform these services appropriately.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><A NAME="d559ff5e"></A></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="RED"><B>Diplomacy: </B></FONT>This is the
grand art of high diplomacy between states or organizations. A
character skilled in diplomacy knows the correct procedures and
unwritten rules of negotiations between states or large
organizations. He is capable of discerning the true intent of the
various declarations, statements, and gifts or exchanges that make up
a diplomatic encounter, and he is able to take his own wishes and
couch them in proper diplomatic terms.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Normally, the character need only make proficiency
checks if the negotiations are particularly delicate or difficult.
However, if there is a specific goal or compromise the character is
working towards, he may attempt a check to see if he can win the
other side over to his point. Naturally, the DM can apply a modifier
of &#150;8 to +8 depending on what the diplomat&#146;s offer means
for the parties involved. Requesting the surrender of a vastly
superior enemy is next to impossible, unless the character can
convince them that they stand to gain something of great value by
giving up. In any event, the DM shouldn&#146;t use this ability as a
substitute for good role-playing by the players.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><A NAME="cbe55f80"></A></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="RED"><B>Investigation: </B></FONT>This is
the art of discovering the truth through careful examination of a
problem or situation. A character with this skill is familiar with
the process of interviewing or interrogating witnesses, searching
scenes for clues or information, and the general execution of a
logical and thorough investigation. Priests who are associated with
the local government may be called upon to solve common crimes
against the state, while other priests may be inquisitors or
theological investigators.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The DM may allow the PC to attempt a proficiency check
when the player is missing an obvious line of inquiry or step of
deductive reasoning, although this should be a rare use of this
ability. An investigation proficiency check can also be used to
discover clues at the scene of a crime or to extract information from
a witness or suspect.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><A NAME="a3d59077"></A></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="RED"><B>Law: </B></FONT>A character with
this proficiency is thoroughly familiar with the legal system of his
homeland and is skilled in representing cases before judges,
officers, nobles, and magistrates. This is a working knowledge of the
law, as opposed to the theoretical knowledge of the sage area of
study. With a successful proficiency check, the character can build a
strong defense for a person accused of a crime; if the judge or jury
are fair-minded and honest, he stands an excellent chance of winning
his client&#146;s case. Of course, corrupt or intimidated officials
can still deliver unjust verdicts despite the character&#146;s best efforts.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><A NAME="671ac806"></A></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="RED"><B>Observation: </B></FONT>Characters
with this proficiency have cultivated exceptional powers of
observation. The DM may ask for a proficiency check anytime there is
something subtly wrong or unusual in the character&#146;s
environment. For example, the character may note the fact that the
tools of a potter&#146;s shop are caked with a different kind of clay
than that present in the workshop, or he might notice telltale marks
of traffic that indicate the presence of a secret door. The DM
shouldn&#146;t let this become a substitute for alertness and good
thinking on the part of the player; if he&#146;s picking up more than
one or two clues a game session with this proficiency, it&#146;s
probably too many.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="RED"><B>Omen Reading: </B></FONT>See the
description under <FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="DD03464.htm">Wizard Proficiencies</A></FONT> .</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><A NAME="a1e222e4"></A></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="RED"><B>Oratory: </B></FONT>This is the
power to move other people with words and emotion. By captivating an
audience, the priest can convince them of the rightness of his words
through force of will and dramatic speaking. Priests with this skill
can attempt to proselytize (seek converts) among small audiences by
proclaiming the glories of their faith and the dangers of nonbelief,
but the character must pass his check by a margin of four or more to
win any long-lasting converts to the faith. A convert will listen to
the priest&#146;s suggestions or ideas, but won&#146;t necessarily
become a follower or hireling of the character.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The DM can decide how any group of listeners is likely
to be affected by the priest&#146;s exhortations. If they&#146;re
inclined to be hostile or are preparing to attack the priest,
there&#146;s very little he can say to change their minds. However,
if the priest passes a proficiency check, he may be able to modify an
encounter reaction check by one category&#151;hostile to indifferent,
or indifferent to friendly, for example. Optionally, he may be able
to encourage the crowd to take a specific action that they&#146;re
inclined to perform anyway. If an angry crowd wants to see an
important prisoner freed because it&#146;s rumored he was convicted
wrongly, a priest with oratory may be able to push them into storming
the jail or convince them to give up and go home. If the player
presents an especially moving argument or speech, the proficiency
check is made with a +1 to +4 bonus.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><A NAME="6423627d"></A></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="RED"><B>Persuasion: </B></FONT>Unlike
oratory, which relies on emotion and rhetoric, the art of persuasion
is built around intelligent arguments and personal charm. A character
with this proficiency is able to present especially cogent arguments
and explanations in conversation with an individual or small group.
With a successful proficiency check, he can convince them to take
moderate actions they may be considering already; for example, he may
convince city guards to leave without making arrests if a brawl&#146;s
already finished by the time they get there, or he may convince a
court official that he needs an audience with the king. If the
player&#146;s thoughts and arguments are particularly eloquent and
acute, the proficiency check is made with a +1 to +4 bonus.</FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="RED"><B>Undead Lore: </B></FONT>A priest
with this proficiency is trained in the identification, powers, and
vulnerabilities of common undead monsters. With a proficiency check,
the character can recall specific tactics or weaknesses of a monster;
for example, if confronted by a vampire, he may recall that a mirror,
garlic, or holy symbol strongly presented can drive the monster away
for a short time. How the character uses this information is up to
the player.</FONT></P>
