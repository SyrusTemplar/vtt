Casting a spell to reveal a character's alignment is just as offensive as
asking him directly. This is the sort of thing that starts fights and ends
friendships. Hirelings and henchmen may decide that a player character who does this is
too distrustful. Strangers often figure the spell is the prelude to an attack
and may strike first.

Even those who consent to the spell are likely to insist that they be allowed
to cast the same in return. Using these spells, besides being rude, indicates a
basic lack of trust on the part of the caster or questioner.
