This spell is a more powerful version of the <I>genius</I> spell. The priest's player may ask the DM one question about the current
situation or about events that will occur within the next five rounds. Questions
about the future must relate to external events, such as &quot;Will the guards respond
to the sentry's yell?&quot; Questions cannot refer to the outcome of combat, such
as &quot;Will we win the battle?&quot; The priest's player is allowed to use this spell to
ask the DM for advice. In this case, the spell is the equivalent of asking the
gods, &quot;Okay, how do we get out of this one?&quot;
<P></P>
Like the <I>genius</I> spell, the DM must be careful in adjudicating this spell. The answer to the
question is always relevant and correct, although not necessarily complete. The
answer can also be cryptic, in the form of a riddle or rhyme, depending on the
DM's assessment of the situation and how potentially unbalancing the answer
might be. In general, the answer will be a short phrase of no more than eight to
ten words.
<P></P>
The material component is a gem of at least 500 gp value. This spell can be
cast only once in any 24-hour period.
