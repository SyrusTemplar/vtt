The best way to avoid the problems described above is to design the
characters' struggle so it is never-ending. At the very least, the conflict is one that
lasts for millennia--well beyond the lifetimes of the player characters.
<P></P>
However, to keep the players from feeling frustrated, certain they can never
accomplish anything, their characters must be able to undertake sizable tasks
and win significant victories. Player characters fighting for the cause of good
may eventually drive back the growing influence of the chief villain, but they
defeat only a symptom, not the disease itself.
<P></P>
There always can be a new threat. Perhaps the evil villain himself returns in
a new and more hideous manifestation. The DM must be prepared with a series of
fantastic yet realistic threats. These gradually increase in scope as the
characters become more powerful.
<P></P>
Thus, it is possible to build a campaign where the forces of alignment play an
active role in things. It is difficult, and there are many hazards, but
imagination and planning can overcome the obstacles.
