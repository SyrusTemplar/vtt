A wizard's hearing can be permanently or temporarily impaired as a result of
deafness (magical or natural), disease, poison, or physical damage (such as
repeated exposure to loud noises). Unlike the vision-impaired wizard, the
hearing-impaired wizard has only modest limitations on his spell casting abilities.
<P></P>
Although most spells have a verbal component, it is not necessary for the
wizard to clearly hear the words or sounds he utters to cast a spell. These sounds
serve to release magical energies which in turn trigger specific reactions; as
long as the wizard utters the correct sequence of sounds, it makes no
difference if he actually hears the sounds himself. Note that a <I>silence</I> spell prevents the casting of any spells with verbal components, since <I>silence</I> prevents the sounds uttered by the wizard.
<P></P>
Spells that require the wizard to hear, such as<I> comprehend languages</I> (when used to translate speech), are ineffective for hearing-impaired
wizards. Spells that create sounds, such as <I>alarm</I>, are able to be cast, but the impaired wizard will not hear the effects.
<P></P>
Hearing-impaired wizards casting illusions with audible elements may encounter
the same problems as vision-impaired wizards. The audible elements of such
illusions will have to be educated guesses, based on the wizard's memory of actual
sounds. As with illusions cast by sight-impaired wizards, the more complex the
illusion cast by a hearing-impaired wizard, the more easily the audible
element of the illusion will be disbelieved by an opponent. The DM is free to add as
much as a +4 bonus to the saving throws of opponents attempting to disbelieve
such illusions. A hearing-impaired wizard cannot use his familiar to serve as
surrogate &quot;ears&quot; to enable him to cast such spells with more precision or accuracy
