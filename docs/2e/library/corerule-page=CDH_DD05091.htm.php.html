<B>Earthwrack </B>(Alteration)
<P></P>
<P></P>
Sphere: Necromantic, Plant
<P></P>
Range: 20 yards/level of caster
<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>
Duration: 2d4+10 years
<P></P>
Casting Time: 1 round
<P></P>
Area of Effect: 30-foot radius/level of caster
<P></P>
Saving Throw: None
<P></P>
<P></P>
This spell causes an area of soil to become barren and blighted. Healthy
plants wither and die within 1d4 days of casting. No seed planted there will grow
for the duration of the spell. Plant-based creatures entering the despoiled area
can see the ruin and feel an intense &quot;wrongness&quot; within the soil. Each round
they remain within the area, they suffer 1d4 points of damage.
<P></P>
The blight can be cured using a<I> limited wish</I>, a <I>wish</I>, or by casting a <I>remove curse</I> spell (at the 12th level of experience) and a plant growth spell
simultaneously.
<P></P>
Most druids consider <I>earthwrack</I> an abomination, although some Shadow Circle druids use it as last-ditch
&quot;scorched earth&quot; vengeance against an unruly hamlet.
<P></P>
The material component is the priest's holy symbol.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>Ivy Siege</B> (Enchantment)
<P></P>
<P></P>
Sphere: Plant
<P></P>
Range: 90 yards
<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>
Duration: 6 turns
<P></P>
Casting Time: 9
<P></P>
Area of Effect: 1 building or similar structure
<P></P>
Saving Throw: Special
<P></P>
<P></P>
The <I>ivy siege</I> spell must be cast upon a stone or brick building constructed upon the earth;
flying castles and the like remain unaffected. Immediately after casting, ivy
begins to grow at a fantastic rate, climbing from the ground up the building's
walls. At the end of one turn, the ivy has climbed the walls. At the end of the
second turn, green creepers have covered the structure. On the third turn, the
ivy has deepened to a black-green and begins to squeeze the building.
<P></P>
Starting on the third turn and every turn thereafter, the building must make a
saving throw vs. siege damage, as if attacked by a small catapult (<A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00504.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDMG_DD00504.htm.php.html">DMG, p. 76</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">). Two cubic feet of the building crumbles away for each point by which the
saving throw misses each turn. This cycle continues until the spell's duration
expires or the building is destroyed. The ivy rots away instantly at the spell's
end.
<P></P>
A druid can cast only one <I>ivy siege</I> per building at a time. After the ivy has rotted away, the druid may cast the
spell on the same building again. However, multiple druids can cast several <I>ivy siege</I> spells on the same building. In the case of a large, interconnected series of
buildings (like a castle), each casting affects only a single tower, keep, or
wall segment, to a maximum of 1,000 cubic feet per level of the caster.
<P></P>
The DM may choose to prohibit arctic and desert druids from using this spell
if they are not familiar with ivy.
<P></P>
The material component is an ivy leaf.
