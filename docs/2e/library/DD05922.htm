Having populated the guild, the final step is to take care of a few practical
details.

Guildmembers have to pay fees to belong to the guild, and they may also have
to pay cuts of their take on jobs which are &quot;licensed by&quot; the guild. The DM
should fix these levels to suit his campaign. For guild dues, a sum equal to about
one month's living expenses for the thief PC is reasonable. This sum will
increase with the gaining of experience levels, which is reasonable. Guildmembers
get cheaper training, and training is longer and more expensive at higher levels,
so higher dues reflect this. Fixing a cut needs to be done on a case-by-case
basis. If the guild has tipped off the thief with a lot of information important
to pulling a robbery, it could well ask for a quarter or even a third or more
of the take, for example.
<P></P>
The dues and other payments due should be recorded by the DM, together with a
brief note on what the PC thief gets in the way of special benefits for his
dues.
