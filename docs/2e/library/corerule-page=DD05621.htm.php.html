This priest is primarily interested in acquiring wisdom and passing it on. He
likes to help people. And since he's a priest, people often come to him with
their troubles; he's always willing to advise them. (Depending on his experience
and personal wisdom, he could be quite good at it, too.)
<P></P>
This personality is best suited to lawful good and neutral good alignments. (A
chaotic good priest could also try to be a sage counselor, but his advice is
likely to be more dramatic and less well-reasoned than that of the other
alignments.)
<P></P>
In combat situations, the Sage Counselor is likely to try to persuade the
enemy to surrender, to run away, or just to be reasonable. This doesn't mean that
he's stupid, though. Confronted with danger, he can hit just as hard and defend
himself and his friends just as fiercely.
<P></P>
In role-playing situations, the Sage Counselor goes out of his way to help
people; if he sees a sad face and has some time available to him, he'll gravitate
to the stricken person, kindly ask if he can help, and end up wrapped again in
some other person's troubles. Incidentally, this is a great way to get the
character involved on new adventures: The DM need merely run a tearful NPC past the
priest, and another adventure is on its way.
