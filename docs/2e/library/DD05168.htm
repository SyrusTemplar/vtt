So far, we've mostly talked about the warrior character and his role in normal <I>AD&amp;D?</I> game campaigns.
<P></P>
However, it's possible to run a good campaign whose characters are <I>mostly warriors . . . or all warriors.
<P></P>
</I> There are a couple of reasons to think about having an all-warrior campaign.
First, in many campaigns, after the first few experience levels, the fighters
increasingly take a back seat to the magic-using classes, whose power increases
faster than the fighters'. Second, many movies, novels, myths and legends just
feature fighter characters, and if one of those settings particularly appeals to
you, and you want to simulate it in your campaign, you'll want to limit your
campaign to fighters.
<P></P>
There are several ways to run such a campaign. Some sample arrangements
include:
<P></P>
<P></P>
Mixed Warrior-Types in a Magical World
<P></P>
Mixed Warrior-Types in a Mostly Non-Magical World
<P></P>
Mixed Warrior-Types in a Strictly Non-Magical World
<P></P>
One Warrior-Type in a Magical World
<P></P>
One Warrior-Type in a Mostly Non-Magical World
<P></P>
One Warrior-Type in a Strictly Non-Magical World
<P></P>
<P></P>
In the second part of this chapter, we'll be talking about all those
arrangements, how they can be set up and what they mean to a campaign.
