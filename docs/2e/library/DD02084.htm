This spell is very much like the 5th-level wizard spell <I>sending,</I> allowing a brief contact with a far distant creature. However, with this
spell the message can also contain a suggestion (see the 3rd-level wizard spell <A HREF="DD01926.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="DD01926.htm">suggestion</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">), which the subject will do its best to carry out if it fails its saving
throw vs. spell, made with a -2 penalty. Of course, if the message is impossible or
meaningless according to the circumstances that exist for the subject at the
time the demand comes, the message is understood but no saving throw is
necessary and the suggestion is ineffective.
<P></P>
The caster must be familiar with the creature contacted and must know its name
and appearance well. If the creature in question is not in the same plane of
existence as the spellcaster, there is a base 5% chance that the demand does not
arrive. Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably
at the option of the DM. The demand, if received, will be understood even if the
creature has an Intelligence ability score as low as 1 (animal Intelligence).
Creatures of demigod status or higher can choose to come or not, as they please.
<P></P>
The demand message to the creature must be 25 words or less, including the
suggestion. The creature can also give a short reply immediately.
<P></P>
The material components of the spell are a pair of cylinders, each open at one
end, connected by a thin piece of copper wire and some small part of the
subject creature--a hair, a bit of nail, etc.
