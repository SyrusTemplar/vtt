In this type of campaign, certain schools of magic do not exist. For instance,
in a world where the school of illusion does not exist, wizards do not have
access to <I>phantasmal force, minor creation</I>, or any other illusion spells, nor are they allowed to specialize as
illusionists. Researching these types of spells is also forbidden. If a spell belongs
to two schools, then the spell is still available if it belongs to a school that
still exists. For instance, in a world where the school of illusion does not
exist, <I>rainbow pattern</I> is available since it also belongs to the school of alteration.

Whether magical items that duplicate the effects of non-existent schools are
available is the DM's decision, but for consistency, it makes sense to forbid
them. Another good idea is to give wizards access to the spells from the school
of lesser divination-- it is very difficult to function as a wizard without
them.

As another variation, the DM might consider having more than one non-existent
school in his campaign world. (Schools in direct opposition to one another, as
shown in Figure 1 in Chapter 2, are good choices to eliminate. For instance, if
the school of illusion is nonexistent, then the school of necromancy might not
exist either). In an especially restrictive world, perhaps only one school of
magic exists; if only the school of illusion exists in the DM's world, then
all wizards must be illusionists and have access only to illusion spells-- spells
from any other school do not exist.
