In this type of campaign, most of the player characters are wizards. Other
classes are allowed, but they are usually restricted to one character from each
class. (That is, a party can have no more than one warrior, one priest, and one
rogue-- the rest are wizards.)
<P></P>
To begin this type of campaign, the DM can encourage players to take PC
wizards by fostering an atmosphere where NPCs have a special admiration for wizards
or where magic is an especially revered field of study. Alternately, the DM can
simply require the players to use wizard characters. All wizard kits are allowed in this type of campaign, as are multi-class and
dual-class characters as long as one of the class choices is wizard. The DM is
forewarned that he will have to be especially creative to invent adversaries of
sufficient power to provide acceptable challenges for a party of wizards.
