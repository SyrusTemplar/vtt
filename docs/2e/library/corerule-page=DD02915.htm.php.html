full of long, sharp teeth, and gaunt but powerful frames. They give the impression
of starving scavengers, with the disposition to match, and they are among the
most chaotic and faithless of all humanoids. Gnolls have a hard time seeing
past the moment, and patience is a virtue unheard of in gnoll society.

Player character gnolls must work hard to overcome the strong (and generally
well-justified) prejudices they will encounter in the world outside their band.
Their short tempers and bestial habits are not much help in dispelling these
beliefs. Despite these distasteful qualities, gnolls can be brave and fierce
fighters and valuable companions—provided they’re not given too many tests of
honor, honesty, or loyalty.
