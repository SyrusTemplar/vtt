</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The Charisma (Cha) score measures a character's persuasiveness, personal
magnetism, and ability to lead. It is not a reflection of physical attractiveness,
although attractiveness certainly plays a role. It is important to all
characters, but especially to those who must deal with nonplayer characters (NPCs),
mercenary hirelings, retainers, and intelligent monsters. It dictates the total
number of henchmen a character can retain and affects the loyalty of henchmen,
hirelings, and retainers.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Maximum Number of Henchmen</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">states the number of nonplayer characters who will serve as permanent
retainers of the player character. It does not affect the number of mercenary soldiers,
men-at-arms, servitors, or other persons in the pay of the character.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Reaction Adjustment</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">indicates the penalty or bonus due to the character because of Charisma when
dealing with nonplayer characters and intelligent creatures. For example, Rath
encounters a centaur, an intelligent creature. Rath's Charisma is only 6, so he
is starting off with one strike against him. He probably should try to overcome
this slight handicap by making generous offers

of gifts or information.
