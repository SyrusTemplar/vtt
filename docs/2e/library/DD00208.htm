At the other extreme from the super character is the character who appears
hopeless. The player is convinced his new character has a fatal flaw that
guarantees a quick and ugly death under the claws of some imaginary foe. Discouraged,
he asks to scrap the character and create another.
<P></P>
In reality, few, if any, characters are truly hopeless. Certainly, ability
scores have an effect on the game, but they are not the overwhelming factor in a
character's success or failure. Far more important is the cleverness and
ingenuity the player brings to the character.
<P></P>
When a player bemoans his bad luck and &quot;hopeless&quot; character, he may just be
upset because the character is not exactly what he wanted. Some players write off
any character who has only one above-average ability score. Some complain if a
new character does not qualify for a favorite class or race. Others complain
if even one ability score is below average. Some players become stuck in
super-character mode. Some want a character with no penalties. Some always want to
play a particular character class and feel cheated if their scores won't allow it.
<P></P>
Some players cite numerical formulas as proof of a character's hopelessness
(&quot;A character needs at least 75 ability points to survive&quot; or &quot;A character
without two scores of 15 or more is a waste of time&quot;). In reality, there is no such
hard and fast formula. There are, in fact, few really hopeless characters.
