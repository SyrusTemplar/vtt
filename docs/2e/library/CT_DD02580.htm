</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Encountering angry giant eagles while clinging to a cliff is usually no fun at
all. Unless they can hover, flying monsters can only make one pass every other
round to attack climbing characters. If the PCs are facing the cliff (most
climbers have to), the flying creatures get the benefit of rear attacks.
Intelligent flyers may try to use their talons to drag a climber off the cliff; treat
this as a grab attack. This forces a climbing check, and even if the character
succeeds, he still must win the Strength contest to stay on the cliff side.
