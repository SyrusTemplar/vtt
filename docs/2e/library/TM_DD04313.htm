When this spell is cast, a narrow shaft of light shines down upon the priest,
making him immune to the effects of natural cold (such as a blizzard) and
granting him a +3 bonus to saving throws vs. magical cold (such as a white dragon's
breath weapon).
<P></P>
For each level of the priest above 7th, an additional beam of light may be
created to protect another creature, who must be standing within 3' of the priest.
Thus, a 10th-level priest could protect four other creatures in a 3' radius.
