Approval and Modification
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> After the player writes up the spell and refines it, the DM should review and
analyze the spell. Is it the right level, or is it more powerful than it should
be? If the PC was the target of his own spell, would it completely obliterate
him? This might be a sign that the spell is too strong. Are the effects
reasonable and appropriate for its power level? Does it permit the subject a chance to
avoid its effects? Does the spell intrude on a role best left to another
character—in other words, would it make the wizard a better thief than the party’s
thief, a better fighter than the party’s fighter, and so on? A spell can take a
few steps in this direction, but it should be examined carefully. And, most
importantly: do you, the DM, think that this spell will make your game better or
make it worse?

However, if it needs some work still, you can either return it to the
player and inform him of any objections, or pencil in the modifications you think
are appropriate to make the spell work in your campaign. Remember, the player
always has the option of deciding to not go through with the research if he
doesn’t like the way the spell turned out after the DM looked at it!
