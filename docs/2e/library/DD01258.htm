</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Some legendary monsters can use their strength and body mass to literally
grind opponents underfoot. To make a crush attack, a creature expends its full
movement allowance for the round, taking no other actions. However, if the creature
is flying or jumping down from a height of 30 feet or more, the creature can
make a crush attack at the end of its movement.
<P></P>
Opponents larger than the attacker cannot be crushed. When a monster makes a
crushing attack, it makes one attack roll for every creature within the area of
effect. An unsuccessful attack roll inflicts no damage. Any creature within the
radius must save vs. death if it is at least one size smaller than the
attacker, even if the creature suffered no damage from the crush attack. If the
defender is two sizes smaller than the attacker, the save is made at ?4, three sizes
smaller warrants a ?8 adjustment, and so on. If the save fails, the opponent is
knocked down and can take no actions until he can stand up again.

and creatures who are knocked down after a crush attack can be trampled if
they are smaller than the attacker. Creatures with the crush power can perform
overruns, but not during rounds when they make crush attacks. Note that unlike
crush attacks, overruns can be used only against creatures smaller than the
attacker.
