<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Puchezma's Powder of Edible Objects:</B> An inveterate traveler who was notoriously cheap, Puchezma could never bring
himself to spend money on decent provisions or hire a quality chef for his long
wilderness excursions. In his efforts to create a seasoning that would make
the bland dishes of his second-rate cooks more palatable, Puchezma stumbled on a
formula for the <I>powder of edible objects.</I>
<P></P>
This powder, which resembles normal salt, causes any normally indigestible
material to become edible, nutritious food. The material must be nonliving and
nonmagical, and must be in a form the consumer can swallow; for instance, dirt and
cotton cloth are acceptable (the diner could chew up and swallow these
materials), but large stones and planks of hard wood are not (these objects would have
to be broken up into small pieces before they could be swallowed). All
poisonous and otherwise harmful properties (such as sharp edges) are negated by the
powder. One pinch of <I>powder of edible objects</I> is sufficient to treat one cubic foot of material. The powder is normally
found in small bags containing 10 to 100 pinches.
