<TITLE>Bracers of Brandishing-- Miscellaneous Magic (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Bracers of Brandishing:</B> These unpredictable and bewildering items appear similar to other magical
bracers, but their magic is revealed only when the character wearing them uses a
charged rod, staff, or wand. When a charge is expended from such an item, the <I>bracers of brandishing</I> alter the charge expenditure and the local balance of magical forces in a
chaotic manner. The drain on the charged rod, staff, or wand is actually in the
range of 5 charges to -4 (i.e., the item is recharged). The number of charges
used is 1d10-5 (with negative results indicating that charges are restored). If an
item is reduced below zero charges by a drain, it crumbles into dust
immediately.
<P></P>
Items that are not normally rechargeable can be recharged through the chaotic
operation of these items except for the <I>rod of absorption</I>.
