</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Battlefields in the great outdoors range from featureless to impassable,
depending on the terrain and ground cover. From the DM’s point of view, an outside
battle is a difficult one to run, since there aren’t many maps of forests or
hillsides around. A second consideration is the possibility of long-range combat
that becomes a melee, forcing a change of scale.

The battlefield generation system in the next section of this chapter deals
with battlefields in all kinds of terrain. Using this system, the DM can randomly
create a detailed battlefield in no time at all.
