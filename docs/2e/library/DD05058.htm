Kabil the Village Druid (next page) associates himself closely with a single
rustic village or hamlet. As he gains experience, his influence can extend to
cover a shire, barony, or entire region. However, his focus remains rural. A
Village Druid always hopes to see ordinary folk live in harmony with Nature.
<P></P>
As a Village Druid, Kabil's aim is twofold: to keep people from exploiting
Nature (by short-sighted agricultural practices, etc.) and to defend and protect
villagers who follow the proper druidic path. Thus, although he will not stand
idly by to see the wilderness threatened, his more vital interest lies with the
local crops, domestic animals, and his own followers. Kabil uses his skills and
magic to protect all living things within his village from foes, disease,
drought, forest fires, or natural disasters.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> A Village Druid normally replaces a conventional priest or cleric in villages
where most inhabitants subscribe to the druidic ethos. As well as offering
protection and guidance, the druid leads the citizenry in ceremonies to observe
births (of humans and animals), deaths, marriages, harvests, the changing of the
seasons, and so on. (See Chapter 4: Role-playing Druids for details.)
<P></P>
This kit suits PCs when the DM decides to set the campaign in a rural area
under a threat or perhaps near unexplored ruins.

<B>Branch Restrictions:</B> None.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Required</I>--sickle or scythe. <I>Recommended</I>--staff.
<P></P>

<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonus</I>-- agriculture. <I>Recommended</I>--(general) animal training, brewing, rope use, weather sense; (priest)
healing, herbalism, local history, religion.
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> The druid should spend his initial allotment of gold pieces entirely upon
equipment, as he loses all unspent starting money in excess of 1 gp.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits: </B>With the DM, decide which village a druid like Kabil protects; the druid lives
in or near this village.
<P></P>
Locals respect Kabil highly and provide him with information about happenings
in the area. He receives a +2 reaction bonus from people and domestic animals
in the village--as long as he remains diligent about his duties. In addition,
the villagers support Kabil at a middle-class lifestyle (<I>DMG</I>, p. 34). This hospitality, rather than tithes, represents the generosity of a
grateful people willing to provide their Village Druid with the best of
everything he needs to live in their midst.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> As a Village Druid, Kabil doesn't have a lot of free time. Locals ask him for
help with all their problems, ranging from bandit raids to a child lost in the
woods. In addition, the druid must spend at least one day each week attending
to village matters: listening to grievances, mediating disputes, finding lost
livestock, tending animals, offering advice on crops, curing diseases,
delivering babies, etc. If he misses a week, his reaction bonus drops by 1 point
(minimum 0) and his income declines a step (from middle class to poor to squalid) as
people become less hospitable. The druid can avoid these penalties if he
arranges with someone else (another druid or a ranger) to look after the village in
his absence.
<P></P>
Kabil's villagers also expect him to protect them from serious harm. If he
fails or if no one sees him at least making an honest effort the DM may reduce or
eliminate his reaction bonus and benefits for as long as the villagers likely
would feel resentful. Role-playing can win back a Village Druid's lost respect;
Kabil can regain his lost reaction bonus and benefits quickly by doing a great
deed to benefit the village, or slowly by simply completing his duties
diligently for several months.
