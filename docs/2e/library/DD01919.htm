When this spell is cast, the wizard creates a quasi-real, horselike creature.
The steed can be ridden only by the wizard who created it, or by any person for
whom the wizard specifically creates such a mount. A phantom steed has a black
head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves
that make no sound. Its eyes are milky-colored. It does not fight, but all normal
animals shun it and only monstrous ones will attack. The mount has an Armor
Class of 2 and 7 hit points, plus 1 per level of the caster. If it loses all of
its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed moves at a movement
rate of 4 per level of the spellcaster, to a maximum movement rate of 48. It
has what seems to be a saddle and a bit and bridle. It can bear its rider's
weight, plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.
<P></P>
These mounts gain certain powers according to the level of the wizard who
created them:
<P></P>
<I>8th Level:</I> The ability to pass over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without
difficulty.
<P></P>
<I>10th Level:</I> The ability to pass over water as if it were firm, dry ground.
<P></P>
<I>12th Level:</I> The ability to travel in the air as if it were firm land, so chasms and the
like can be crossed without benefit of a bridge. Note, however, that the mount
cannot casually take off and fly; the movement must be between points of similar
altitude.
<P></P>
<I>14th Level:</I> The ability to perform as if it were a pegasus; it flies at a rate of 48 per
round upon command.
<P></P>
Note that a mount's abilities include those of lower levels; thus, a
12th-level mount has the 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-level abilities.
