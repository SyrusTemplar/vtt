</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> A scion or lesser scion with this power eventually regenerates any damage it
suffers unless attacked with fire, acid, or magical wounding, such as a <I>sword of wounding</I> or a legendary monster’s wounding power (damage from the subsequent bleeding
can be regenerated, however). If the creature is killed by a <I>disintegrate</I> or death magic spell it cannot regenerate back to life. Nor can it regenerate
back to life if killed by an attack that does not allow regeneration. If
killed by normal attacks, a scion or lesser scion cannot regenerate back to life if
its remains are destroyed by fire, acid, disintegration, or a 10th-level
destroy spell at double difficulty (see <A HREF="DD01326.htm#6b34b5d0"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01326.htm#6b34b5d0">page 123</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">).
<P></P>
An elder or great elder can regenerate almost any form of damage if it
survives the attack that inflicted the damage. These monsters cannot regenerate damage
from a wounding effect, but they can heal themselves of the bleeding damage
associated with such attacks. Once killed, an elder or great elder can be
prevented from regenerating by destroying their remains as noted previously.
<P></P>
A paragon’s regeneration power is all but unstoppable—the creature can
regenerate any type of damage. If completely disintegrated or slain outright by death
magic, the creature returns to life after the amount of time required to
regenerate 20 hit points and keeps right on regenerating until it reaches full hit
points. The only way to permanently kill the creature is to reduce it to –20 hit
points and use a <I>wish</I> or a 10th-level destroy spell at triple difficulty. The DM also might decide
that some exotic process (see <A HREF="DD01285.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01285.htm">page 91</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">) or special weapon can also kill the creature permanently. For example, a
paragon gorgon might be killed permanently if a noble genie eats its heart or if
the killing blow is delivered with an ancient king’s sword.
