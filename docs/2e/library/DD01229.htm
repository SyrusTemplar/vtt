Time flows at the same rate throughout the known multiverse. This section,
however, deals with newly discovered worlds. <A HREF="DD01230.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01230.htm">Table 2</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> shows the rate of local time flow compared to that of the base campaign
world. In worlds with ratings of 9 or less time flows more quickly than in the base
campaign, allowing travelers to make extended visits and return home to find
that almost no time has passed at all. In worlds with ratings of 13 or more time
flows more slowly than in the base campaign, and travelers might return home to
find their world greatly changed after even a short visit.

Characters are governed by the local time no matter where they are or what
world they call home. For example, characters who visit a C2 world and stay a year
return home to find that less than a minute has gone by, but they are still a
year older. Characters who visit a C18 world and stay two weeks return to find
that 20 years have passed, even though they have aged only two weeks. Likewise,
the durations of magical effects are governed by local time, a spell that
lasts 10 rounds on a C11 world also lasts 10 rounds on a C20 or a C2 world.

There is no simple way to judge the local time flow—it always seems to be
normal. Time is pervasive; even the interiors of closed extra-dimensional spaces
(such as <I>portable holes, bags of holding, </I>and<I> rope trick</I> spells) experience local time. The shift from one time flow to another is
imperceptible by itself, but clues are sometimes obvious—such as when a character
steps through a portal at noon and steps out into a moonlit night.
