So how good is a bard's performance? It depends partly upon his skill and
level, but most importantly, upon his reputation. The songs of a famous skald
hailing from the icy north are met with great anticipation and acceptance. An
infamous blade known for his many assassinations draws just as large a crowd to his
daring performances of weaponry.

Reputation is an intangible aspect of any bard. As the bard travels the path
of life, his reputation can grow into that of a great singing hero, it can be
slandered so everyone thinks the bard is a cowardly oaf, or the bard's reputation
can become an infamous cloak with which to frighten watchmen and thrill the
crowds.

When you first generate your character, his reputation is based upon that of
his family. From there, events and the way the bard is role-played continually
adjust his reputation. Read on for the events that define a bard's reputation.
