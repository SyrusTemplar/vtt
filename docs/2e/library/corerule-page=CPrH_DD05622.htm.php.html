Sometimes, as mentioned above, it becomes necessary for a player to re-think
his character's personality. Perhaps the character has outgrown that
personality. (The Earnest Novice must eventually grow up, for instance.) Perhaps dramatic
events have forced the character to re-think his goals and attitudes. (This
often happens to the Crusader and the Politician.)
<P></P>
Since these Personality Types are not part of an official rule or game
mechanic, the player can change them as he chooses. He shouldn't change his
character's personality just because he's bored with it, though: Events in the campaign
should be the factors which influence this change. Here are some ways it can
come about.
<P></P>
The<B> Crusader</B> might achieve his life-long goal, or lead one party too many into death and
disaster and realize that all he's doing is hurting people. In this case, he
could become embittered and turn into a Hypocrite, playing on his good reputation,
or could tone his approach down and become a Motivator, or could achieve a
measure of wisdom and become a Sage Counselor.
<P></P>
The<B> Earnest Novice</B> could wise up and realize that the world is a more complicated and
unfathomable place than he thought. If he becomes disillusioned by this, he could turn
into a Hypocrite. If he simply matures a bit, he'd be a Motivator. If he acquires
a specific goal, he could become a Crusader, Politician or Proselytizer. And
if he simply acquires a bit of wisdom or perspective, he could become a
Philosopher or Sage Counselor.
<P></P>
The <B>Hypocrite</B> could change his personality if he is confronted by the harm he causes and
cares at all about it. (If he doesn't care, he won't change.) If he does change,
he's likely to become a Crusader (trying to expose and eliminate other
Hypocrites), a Politician (so he can gain enough power to weed Hypocrites out of his
order), or even a Sage Counselor (who can possibly anticipate the tactics of
other charismatic users).
<P></P>
The <B>Motivator</B> could run out of energy; after too many years of battering himself against
the brick wall of an uncaring world, he might tire out. In this case, he's likely
to become a more sedate Philosopher or Sage Counselor. He could conceivably
become embittered and become a Hypocrite.
<P></P>
The <B>Philosopher</B> isn't likely to change. His personality comes with maturity, not before it.
If he does change, it will probably be because he's grown tired of being dull
and undramatic, and he's likely to become a Motivator, one anxious for adventure,
combat and life in general.
<P></P>
The <B>Politician</B> will probably change only if he perceives that he's doing more than good (and
if he minds that). In this case, he'll probably shy away from real
responsibility in the future and become a Philosopher.
<P></P>
The <B>Proselytizer</B> is likely to realize that he is not serving his god best simply by converting
others to that god's worship. He's likely then to become a Crusader, so that
he can avidly pursue one of his god's specific goals; a Motivator, so that he
can bring energy to other priests of his order; or a Politician, so that he can
improve the stature of his god's worship through reorganization of the
priesthood.
<P></P>
The<B> Sage Counselor</B>, like the Philosopher, isn't likely to change; this is a personality that is
acquired with experience.
