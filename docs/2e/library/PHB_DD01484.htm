<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A priest of a particular mythos is allowed to cast the spells from only a few,
related spheres. The priest's deity will have major and minor accesses to
certain spheres, and this determines the spells available to the priest. (Each
deity's access to spheres is determined by the DM as he creates the pantheon of his
world.) The 16 spheres of influence are defined in the following paragraphs.
<P></P>
A priest whose deity grants major access to a sphere can choose from any spell
within that sphere (provided he is high enough in level to cast it), while one
allowed only minor access to the sphere is limited to spells of 3rd level or
below in that sphere. The combination of major and minor accesses to spheres
results in a wide variation in the spells available to priests who worship
different deities.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"> <B>All</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">refers to spells usable by any priest, regardless of mythos. There are no
Powers (deities) of the Sphere of All. This group includes spells the priest needs
to perform basic functions.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Animal</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> spells are those that affect or alter creatures. It does not include spells
that affect people. Deities of nature and husbandry typically operate in this
sphere.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"> <B>Astral</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">is a small sphere of spells that enable movement or communication between the
different planes of existence. The masters of a plane or particularly
meddlesome powers often grant spells from this sphere.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Charm</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> spells are those that affect the attitudes and actions of people. Deities of
love, beauty, trickery, and art often allow access to this sphere.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Combat</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> spells are those that can be used to directly attack or harm the enemies of
the priest or his mythos. These are often granted by deities of war or death.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Creation</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> spells enable the priest to produce something from nothing, often to benefit
his followers. This sphere can fill many different roles, from a provider to a
trickster.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Divination</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> enables the priest to learn the safest course of action in a particular
situation, find a hidden item, or recover long-forgotten information. Deities of
wisdom and knowledge typically have access to this sphere.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Elemental</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> spells are all those that affect the four basic elements of creation--earth,
air, fire, and water. Nature deities, elemental deities, those representing or
protecting various crafts, and the deities of sailors would all draw spells
from this sphere.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Guardian</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> spells place magical sentries over an item or person. These spells are more
active than protection spells because they create an actual guardian creature of
some type. Protective, healing, and trickster deities may all grant spells of
this sphere.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Healing</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> spells are those that cure diseases, remove afflictions, or heal wounds.
These spells cannot restore life or regrow lost limbs. Healing spells can be
reversed to cause injury, but such use is restricted to evil priests. Protective and
merciful deities are most likely to grant these spells, while nature deities
may have lesser access to them.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Necromantic</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> spells restore to a creature some element of its life-force that has been
totally destroyed. It might be life, a limb, or an experience level. These spells
in reverse are powerfully destructive, and are used only by extremely evil
priests. Deities of life or death are most likely to act in this sphere.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Plant</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> spells affect plants, ranging from simple agriculture (improving crops and
the like) to communicating with plant-like creatures. Agricultural and nature
Powers grant spells in this sphere.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Protection</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> spells create mystical shields to defend the priest or his charges from evil
attacks. War and protective deities are most likely to use these, although one
devoted to mercy and kindness might also bestow these spells.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Summoning</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> spells serve to call creatures from other places, or even other dimensions,
to the service of the priest. Such service is often against the will of the
creature, so casting these spells often involves great risk. Since creatures
summoned often cause great harm and destruction, these spells are sometimes bestowed
by war or death powers.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sun</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> spells are those dealing in the basic powers of the solar universe--the
purity of light and its counterpart darkness. Sun spells are very common with
nature, agricultural, or life-giving powers.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weather</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> spells enable the priest to manipulate the forces of weather. Such
manipulation can be as simple as providing rain to parched fields, or as complex as
unbridling the power of a raging tempest. Not surprisingly, these tend to be the
province of nature and agricultural powers and appear in the repertoire of sea and
ocean powers.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Additional spheres can be created by your DM. The listed spheres are typical
of the areas in which deities concentrate their interest and power. Spells
outside the deity's major and minor spheres of influence are not available to its
priests.
<P></P>
Furthermore, the priest can obtain his spells at a faster or slower pace than
the normal cleric. Should the character's ethos place emphasis on
self-reliance, the spell progression is slower. Those deities associated with many amazing
and wondrous events might grant more spells per level. Of course, your DM has
final say on this, and he must balance the gain or loss of spells against the
other powers, abilities, and restrictions of the character.
