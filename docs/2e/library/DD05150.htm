<B>Description:</B> This hero represents some tribe (either civilized or barbarian) living in a
dangerous, threatening, or unusual wilderness environmentâ€”such as the desert,
deep in swamp territory, in the frozen North, tucked away in the jungle or
tropical rain forest, or in distant mountains.
<P></P>
The Wilderness Warrior is different from the Barbarian. He's not automatically
a menacing figure when travelling around in the campaign's normal society;
he's just exotic and unusual. He can be very cultured and civilized, but, coming
as he does from a different culture, will have different attitudes from the
other player-characters on many subjects.
<P></P>
For example, a desert nomad character may be merely offended at the theft of
his property but be outraged by (and demand the death penalty for) theft of his
water; he may believe that women should stay in camp and leave fighting to the
men (an opinion he will find himself quickly disabused from when in the outer
world); he may feel the need to prostrate himself whenever he passes the church
or temple of the deity he worships; and so on.
<P></P>
The player decides (with DM's permission) what sort of tribe and environment
the Wilderness Warrior comes from. Then, working with the DM, he must determine
what sort of unusual beliefs and customs the character and his tribe possess.
He may later abandon a few of these beliefs in the outer world, but should not
abandon most of them; they are part of what makes him unique in the campaign.
<P></P>
To be a Wilderness Warrior, the character must have a Constitution score of at
least 13.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> In a campaign, like the Barbarian and Savage, the Wilderness Warrior is the
&quot;outsider's voice&quot; who questions all the strange quirks and discrepancies in the
player-characters' culture. He's also an opportunity for some comic-relief
adventures, when he misinterprets some aspect of the society and it leads him into
confusion and trouble. More importantly, the DM should arrange for the
occasional adventure to take place in lands like those of his birth, so that he can
demonstrate his skills in that environment.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> If you're using the Secondary Skills rules, the Wilderness Warrior may choose
his skill from the following list: Fisher, Forester, Hunter, Sailor,
Trapper/Furrier.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> The Wilderness Warrior may spend his Weapon Proficiencies any way he pleases.
The DM may insist that he spend one or two on weapons appropriate to his
culture: A desert nomad should have Scimitar and Short Composite Bow, while an
arctic warrior should have Harpoon and Spear, for instance.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Bonus Proficiencies: Survival (in his native environment), Endurance.
Recommended: Any relating to the land of his birth, such as Animal Handling, Animal
Training, Dancing (his cultural dances), Fire-building, Fishing, Riding
(Land-based), Swimming, (Warrior) Mountaineering, Tracking.
<P></P>
<B>Equipment:</B> The Wilderness Warrior may only spend his starting gold on items appropriate
to his culture. For example, the desert nomad couldn't buy any armor at all
with his starting gold, while the arctic warrior could only have leather or hide
armor. (Of course, if the DM determines that his is a trading culture, he could
have access to goods from all over the world.) The Wilderness Warrior <I>doesn't</I> have to spend all his starting gold before entering play. Once he begins
play, there are no restrictions on what sorts of equipment he may buy.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> The Wilderness Warrior gets a special bonus of +5 to his Survival proficiency
roll. This only applies to the Survival proficiency pertaining to environments
like that of his origin; if he later takes a second Survival proficiency for
another type of territory, the bonus doesn't count toward it.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> The Wilderness Warrior, in his early years, is occasionally hindered by his
unfamiliarity with the player-characters' society, but this is a role-playing
consideration; the DM must occasionally enforce it until he believes the
character is sufficiently familiar with the usual culture.
<P></P>
<B>Wealth Options:</B> The Wilderness Warrior gets the usual 5d4 x 10 gp in starting gold.
<P></P>
<B>Races:</B> This is a very appropriate Warrior Kit for demihuman warriors, and the DM may
wish to create some unusual demihuman tribes to showcase it. For example,
everyone would expect Dwarven Wilderness Warriors from the mountains, Elf and Gnome
Wilderness Warriors from the tropical rain forest, etc. But what about Desert
Dwarves? Arctic Elves? Swamp Gnomes? Mountain Halflings? Such unusual choices
can add some color to a campaign.
