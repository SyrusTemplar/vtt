By means of this spell, the caster is able to enter any plant (human-sized or
larger) and pass any distance to a plant of the same species in a single round,
regardless of the distance separating the two. The entry plant must be alive.
The destination plant need not be familiar to the caster, but it also must be
alive. If the caster is uncertain of the destination plant, he need merely
determine direction and distance, and the <I>transport via plants</I> spell moves him as close as possible to the desired location. There is a 20%
chance, reduced by 1% per level of experience of the caster, that the transport
delivers the caster to a similar species of plant from 1 to 100 miles away
from the desired destination plant. If a particular destination plant is desired,
but the plant is not living, the spell fails and the caster must come forth
from the entrance plant within 24 hours. Note that this spell does not function
with plantlike creatures such as shambling mounds, treants, etc. The destruction
of an occupied plant slays the caster (see the<I> <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02218.htm.php.html"></A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02218.htm.php.html">plant door</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> spell).
