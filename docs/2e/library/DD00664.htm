Beyond the inner planes (continuing with the spheres) is the <I>Astral plane.</I> Like the Ethereal planes, this plane serves as a connector between the
different realities. It links the various Primes to each other (one travels from one
Prime to another by crossing the Astral plane, not the Ethereals) and connects
each Prime to the outer planes.
<P></P>
The Astral plane is a barren place with only rare bits of solid matter.
Indeed, the most common feature is the silver cords of travelers in the plane. These
cords are the lifelines that keep travelers of the Plane from becoming lost,
stretching all the way back to the traveler's point of origin.
