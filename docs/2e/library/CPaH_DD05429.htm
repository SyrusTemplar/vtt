   Here's what a typical day might be like for two different paladins: a
Chevalier named Sir Jounville, who works in his king's stronghold, and Madeline of
Blackfern, a Divinate who lives in a monastery.
<P></P>
<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
   Sir Jounville rises about an hour before dawn, awakening in his private
quarters in the stronghold cellar. He washes in a ceramic basin of cold water, then
dresses in a waist-length tunic with full sleeves, a short-sleeved tunic lined
with fox fur, a loose mantle secured at the neck with a silver chain, linen
hosiery, and leather boots. He visits the stronghold chapel for the morning prayer,
then stops at the kitchen for a quick breakfast of bread and ale.
<P></P>
   Jounville reports to the steward's quarters for a brief meeting to review the
events of the day ahead. The steward reminds him of an important banquet that
evening, a birthday celebration for the king's niece. Jounville assures the
steward that he'll be prompt.
<P></P>
   Jounville joins three companions in the bailey for morning exercise, focusing
today on weight lifting and archery practice. Meanwhile, other residents of the
stronghold have risen and are beginning to fill the bailey. Maidens embroider
tablecloths for the royal family, cooks roast mutton for the evening feast, and
children play noisily with horseshoes and tops.
<P></P>
   After two hours of exercise, Jounville walks to the stables to see if the
groomsman has fitted his horse with new shoes. With winter approaching, Jounville
wants to make sure the shoes have <I>calkins</I>, metallic points that enable the horse to grip the frozen ground. The
groomsman has finished the work, and Jounville examines each shoe carefully, checking
for rough edges, proper weight, and tight nail heads. Satisfied, Jounville
thanks the groomsman for a job well done.
<P></P>
   The time approaches for Jounville's guard duty. He returns to his quarters to
don his chain mail armor and retrieve his shield, sword, longbow, and arrows.
At the kitchen, he picks up a herring pie flavored with pepper and cinnamon that
he'll eat later.
<P></P>
   He climbs the ladder to the bastion tower and settles behind a narrow arrow
slit. He peers through the slit, surveying the wide field that borders the
stronghold's north wall. All is quiet. Sir Northram, whom Jounville is relieving,
reports no disturbances on his watch.
<P></P>
   For the next eight hours, Jounville stares silently through the slit, bow in
hand, pausing only briefly in mid-afternoon to eat his herring pie. His watch is
uneventful.
<P></P>
   At five o'clock, Sir Inniss arrives to relieve Jounville. Jounville visits the
chapel for an afternoon prayer, then goes back to his quarters to prepare for
the banquet. He puts on fresh tunics and hosiery, powders his mantle with talc,
and buffs his shoes. He also polishes his shield and sword; the king likes for
his paladins to bring their combat gear to impress the guests.
<P></P>
   The banquet begins exactly at seven. About 70 guests are present, including
the king and his retinue, various aristocrats and clergymen, and six of the
king's paladins, including Jounville. Jounville takes his seat at the furthest end
of the table; guests of high status, such as the king's family and church
dignitaries, sit near the center. A servant brings Jounville his table service,
consisting of iron tableware, a <I>manchet</I> (a slab of stale bread, used as a plate), a glass goblet, and a <I>mazer</I> (a soup bowl trimmed in silver).
<P></P>
   Following a benediction and introduction of the guests of honor, servants
bring platters heaped with food. The main course includes <I>blankmanger</I> (chicken and rice seasoned with sugar and almonds), <I>mortrews</I> (dumplings made of fish, bread crumbs, and eggs), glazed onions and peas,
mustard and wine sauces, and stewed fruit. Jounville follows meticulous rules of
etiquette, careful to wipe his spoon after each use and to take small portions.
<P></P>
   The meal lasts for two hours. Servants bring water bowls for the guests to
wash their hands, then clear the tables. The guests retire to the ballroom for
entertainment. Bards and jesters sing songs and tell stories, while the younger
guests join hands and dance in a circle. Elder guests play backgammon or chess
and catch up on local gossip. Jounville circulates, engaging in polite small
talk. Near the end of the evening, Jounville recites a poem composed especially for
the occasion, accompanied by a bard who plays the lute.
<P></P>
   The entertainment will last until the early hours of the morning. But at 11
o'clock, Jounville approaches an aide and requests permission to be excused.
Jounville retires to his quarters, offering a final evening prayer before settling
into bed.

<P></P>

<P></P>
   Madeline of Blackfern, a paladin-in-residence at the Heart's Hope Monastery,
begins her daily routine at midnight when she's awakened by the peal of bells
from the prayer tower. Madeline rises, puts on a cloth mantle, leather slippers,
and a prayer cap, then joins her fellow paladins in the chapel. Madeline
recites a long prayer, then goes to the stables to feed and water the monastery's
horses, part of her assigned duties. Except for the prayer, Madeline is expected
to observe total silence.
<P></P>
   Her chores complete, Madeline returns to bed. The bells awaken her again at
five. She dresses again, walks silently to the chapel, and listens to the morning
sermon. She fills the next two hours with exercise, meditation, and household
tasks. A bell signals breakfast, the main meal of the day. Madeline provides
her own dishes and tableware, as do all residents of the monastery. Breakfast
consists of beef, mutton, bread, and fruit, simply prepared. Leftovers are
distributed to poor families in the area.
<P></P>
   After breakfast, Madeline receives her orders for the day. Madeline will spend
two hours kneading bread dough in the main kitchen, two hours assisting the
monastery's blacksmith to forge horseshoes, and the remaining daylight hours
patrolling the grounds on foot. Prayer services will be given approximately every
three hours, as signaled by the bells. Except for emergencies or pre-approved
communications, Madeline is expected to remain silent all day.
<P></P>
   At eight o'clock, Madeline eats an evening meal of bread and vegetables in the
dining hall. She feeds and waters the horses again, then meets with her
superior to confess any sins she may have committed during the previous 24 hours. She
admits to coveting her friend's new sandals. For penance, the superior orders
her to help her friend sweep the stables. Madeline returns to her quarters,
kneels at her bed for a final prayer, then catches a few hours of sleep before the
bells awaken her at midnight.
