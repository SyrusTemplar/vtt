This sphere includes spells that provide protection of clearly defined areas,
ranging from small objects to entire villages. The magical boundaries
established by these spells prevent entry or negate the effects of specific creatures,
energies, or conditions. Many of the spells take advantage of cooperative magic,
involving the casting of a spell by a number of assembled priests to enchant
exceptionally large areas (refer to specific spells and the sections in this
book on Faith Magic, Devotional Power, and Cooperative Magic for more
information). Deities of war and protection, as well as those associated with benevolence
and mercy, might bestow these spells.
