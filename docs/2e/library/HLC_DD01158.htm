</B>Handling Defeat</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
The easiest way to decide what a creature does in the face of impending defeat
is to check its morale rating and roll the dice to see if it runs away. Don’t
handle every foe this way. Player characters don’t have to check morale, and
neither should important nonplayer characters, monsters, or other foes.
Rank-and-file troops, however, are part of an encounter’s setting and should follow the
morale rules. Very few leaders are so charismatic that <I>all</I> their followers march to their deaths <I>all</I> of the time. Likewise, the PCs’ own allies and henchmen might quit the field
at times when the heroes find it inconvenient for them to retreat.
<P></P>
In many campaigns, the DM follows the forgoing advice at least in part;
monsters and villains usually slug it out with the PCs until the bitter end. Fighting
to the death isn’t such a bad idea, because most PCs can obliterate fleeing
opponents before they have a chance to get away. If death is inevitable, one
might as well do as much damage to the enemy as possible before dying.
<P></P>
Defeat need not always mean death or retreat, even in a pitched battle. Real
battles, for example, have much lower kill rates than fantasy battles. Picket’s
infamous charge during the Battle of Gettysburg killed 50% of the attackers;
that means half the people who participated in the attack survived. There are
basically four options open to an opponent who is staring defeat in the face:

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Motivations</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Exactly which option an opponent takes should depend on the creature’s
motivations, knowledge of the enemy, and resources. Start by thinking about why the
opponent is attacking in the first place.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Coercion: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Opponents who attack because a stronger creature has forced them into it might
very well fight to the death. For these creatures, fleeing the battle might be
worse than dying at the hands of the PCs. Creatures that have been forced to
attack usually don’t have the resources or creativity to regain the upper hand
through some bold action when things begin to go bad—they stick with the
original strategy against the PCs unless told otherwise.
<P></P>
If the PCs have a reputation for showing mercy, foes who are too fearful of
their masters to run away might surrender instead. If the PCs have a reputation
for killing every opponent who crosses swords with them, however, no foe is
likely to surrender under any circumstances.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Magical Motivations:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B> </B>Opponents who attack because they have been magically charmed or are under
some other kind of externally imposed compulsion to attack might literally be
unable to preserve themselves through flight or surrender. Likewise, their clouded
mental state often prevents them from winning a victory through some inspired
action.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>The Home Front:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B> </B>Opponents who are defending their homes or a fortification usually do not quit
the field altogether. Instead, they most often try to fall back so they can
attack again. If unable to retreat, the opponent might surrender in hopes of
delaying the attacker (prisoners can be such an encumbrance) or for the chance to
break free and attack again at an opportune moment.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Looting: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Opponents seeking loot or who attack during an unplanned encounter flee at the
first hint of difficulty. Brigands and cutthroats who commit crimes when the
opportunities present themselves fall into this category.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Pride: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Opponents who have attacked out of sheer bravado, spite, or aggressiveness
usually do not flee from a battle except as part of a calculated plan of
hit-and-run attacks. When faced with utter defeat, this type of opponent tries something
dramatic, such as a retributive strike with a<I> staff of power</I>, rather than surrender or flee.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Leaving the Field</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
An effective retreat, like an effective attack, requires some advance planning
and a grasp of the current situation. To flee an encounter successfully, a
creature has to accomplish three things: outrun the PCs, survive or foil the PCs’
ranged attacks, and elude any long-term pursuit the PCs might attempt.
<P></P>
Of course, what looks like flight can easily be a rush to higher ground or the
beginning of a series of hit-and-run attacks against the party.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Running Away:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B> </B>Outrunning the PCs is best accomplished by moving faster than the heroes.
Failing that, the fleeing creature should go somewhere that the PCs cannot follow.
For example, a horde of kobolds has no chance to outdistance a company of
mounted knights on a road or in clear terrain, but they probably could get away if
they fled down a steep, wooded slope where horses could not follow. It is always
best to have an escape route in mind before a battle starts, and most
intelligent combatants (except, perhaps, PCs) do so.
<P></P>
The surest way to flee a battle is through spells such as <I>teleport, dimension door, word of recall, phase door, plane shift,</I> and items with similar effects, such as <I>cubic gates</I> and <I>amulets of the planes</I>. These spells and devices work quickly and whisk the users far away, leaving
no real clues as to their whereabouts.
<P></P>
If the opponent is too slow to get away and doesn’t have a magical means to
escape quickly, the best bet is to misdirect or divert the PCs. There are many
ways to create successful diversions. Powerful magical illusions, such as a <I>programmed illusion</I> triggered by a command word, or<I> invisibility</I> tend to work the best. Reinforcements are great for shifting an attacker’s
attention away from an all-but defeated opponent. If neither of these are
available, an opponent can try something desperate, such as throwing dust or red-hot
embers in the PCs’ eyes. Spells such as <I>wall of fog, fog cloud, mount,</I> or <I>rope trick</I> are ideal for a personal escape.
<P></P>
If the PCs cannot be distracted, the next best thing is to do something that
slows them down. A few caltrops, a raging brush fire, or some tripwires can
discourage direct pursuit, as can spells such as <I>web</I> or <I>entangle.
<P></P>
</I>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Foiling Ranged Attacks:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B> </B>Opponents who have put some distance between themselves and the PCs are still
not entirely out of danger. Many characters can deal out impressive amounts of
damage from considerable distances with missile fire or spells.
<P></P>
The best way to deal with distance attacks is to get out of range as quickly
as possible. Sometimes the method of escape takes care of the
problem—teleportation outdistances just about anything instantaneously.
<P></P>
If the opponent cannot get out of range quickly, the next best thing to do is
take cover or hide. Even a little bit of concealment from a hedgerow or orchard
can make missile attacks harder to use. Simply hiding makes some highly useful
spells impossible to use because these attacks must be directed at something
the caster can see (see <A HREF="PHB_DD01652.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01652.htm">PHB</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">, Chapter 7). An opponent who shuffles his feet to create a cloud of dust or
employs spells such as <I>wind wall</I> or <I>obscurement</I> can live to fight another day. An <I>antimagic shell</I> makes a great mobile shield against spell attacks. The spell’s big
disadvantage is that it neutralizes the caster’s own magic, but that’s usually not a
problem when the user is running away. Magical items such as <I>cubes of force</I> are very useful for defeating ranged attacks.
<P></P>
Sometimes it is useful to delay flight for a few rounds and cripple the PCs’
ability to use ranged attacks. A <I>warp wood</I> spell on a warrior’s bow or a called shot that breaks a ranged weapon can
save a lot of future trouble. Wizards and priests might have a little difficulty
concentrating on spells if their opponents have splashed them with acid or
flaming oil before they flee.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Foiling Long-Term Pursuit:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B> </B>Once a fleeing opponent has broken away from an encounter and gotten out of
the PCs’ sight, the opponent isn’t entirely safe. A determined party can track an
opponent back to his lair, striking again while the foe is weak. If the PCs
succeed, they also gain whatever treasures the opponent has stored in the lair.
<P></P>
The surest way to discourage long-term pursuit is to leave behind no trail;
the PCs can’t follow if they don’t know where the opponent has gone.
Teleportation magic is excellent for this purpose. Flight is the next best mode of escape,
as it allows for quick travel over any kind of terrain and leaves behind no
tracks. The <I>pass without trace</I> spell can be useful for hiding a trail, but it also allows resourceful PCs to
track the fugitive magically for a short time (1d6 turns, see the spell
description in the <A HREF="PHB_DD02139.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD02139.htm">PHB</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">), which makes it unsuitable for opponents who wish to flee only a short
distance.
<P></P>
Opponents who cannot avoid leaving a trail should try to leave a very faint
trail. Rocky areas make better escape routes than muddy ones. If the PCs are
tracking the fugitive by scent, the opponent can throw them off the trail by
crossing a river or leaving behind something to cover the scent, such as pepper or
another pungent spice.
<P></P>
Making the PCs think they have lost the trail can be an effective ploy. A <I>polymorph self</I> or <I>alter self</I> spell can allow a fugitive to take flight, which makes the trail appear to
end abruptly. If flying is impractical (as might be the case if the PCs can fly),
polymorphing into a new form changes the tracks and might confuse trackers,
especially if the change to a new form takes place in a location where tracks are
hard to find. For example, a party might have a fairly easy time tracking a
fleeing ogre mage. They might be very confused, however, when they follow the
trail to a busy road and the only tracks they find on the other side were made by
an elf. A delayed use of the<I> pass without trace</I> spell also is useful for this purpose. A party of trackers might not think to
check the area with a <I>detect magic</I> spell when the trail they’ve been following for an hour suddenly disappears.
<P></P>
A fleeing opponent can confuse pursuers by changing his mode of travel.
Keeping a mount hidden near the battlefield allows for an unanticipated burst of
speed; it also helps protect the mount from injury or death during the battle. A
hidden cache of potions such as <I>speed, flying, polymorph self, gaseous form,</I> and <I>oil of etherealness</I> can accomplish the same thing.
<P></P>
Terrain can be a fugitive’s ally. The earlier suggestion about going where the
PCs can’t works in the long term, too. Disappearing into a monster-infested
swamp can slow down even the best-equipped PCs. An armored paladin might have
great deal of difficulty tracking a fleeing assassin up the side of a mountain.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>The Perils of Withdrawing:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B> </B>Opponents seeking to withdraw to a better position rather than fleeing
altogether face a set of problems different from creatures who wish to simply escape.
<P></P>
The biggest problem is to avoid an overwhelming attack while moving; if the
PCs vigorously press the attack, an orderly withdrawal becomes a rout. Speed is
also important—it doesn’t do any good for an opponent to fall back if the PCs
get to where the opponent is going first.
<P></P>
The best way to ensure a safe withdrawal is to restrict the PCs’ movement. A
large force of opponents might withdraw in smaller groups, leaving behind a team
to keep the PCs engaged in melee while the remainder fall back and prepare to
support the team’s withdrawal. Many other things can hinder an attacker’s
ability to follow and harass withdrawing opponents: the various wall spells;
prepared traps such as covered pits; spells such as<I> slow, entangle, repulsion,</I> <I>and solid fog</I>; natural terrain, such as hillsides; and fortifications, such as ditches and
walls.
<P></P>
It never hurts to have support waiting when making a withdrawal. A hidden
group of archers or spellcasters can do a lot to discourage PCs from following
withdrawing troops too closely.
<P></P>
The preceding comments about dealing with the PCs’ ranged attacks also apply
here. A prearranged escape route or a plan designed to minimize the effects of
the PCs’ spells and missiles can make a withdrawal much easier to complete.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hit-and-Run Tactics:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B> </B>Opponents who have decided to wear the PCs down through a series of
hit-and-run attacks advance and withdraw according to some kind of prearranged plan
(though they might concoct the plan at the spur of the moment). Generally, the
opponent should hit the PCs hard and be gone before they effectively react. Some
useful ideas include:

devastating.

Spellcasters and mounted characters are the prime targets because they can most
readily make counterattacks and interfere with the opponents’ withdrawal.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Surrender</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
Opponents choose surrender as a last resort. A creature that surrenders has
made a conscious decision—however hastily—that becoming a prisoner is preferable
to risking death by continuing the fight or running away.
<P></P>
It’s always helpful to have a bargaining chip. Opponents who have something
the PCs might think is valuable, such as information or treasure, have more
motivation to surrender than opponents who do not. Most opponents do not give up
their bargaining chips easily—they withhold them until they can be sure of
reasonable treatment.
<P></P>
There is no reason why an opponent should be a model prisoner. The creature
might do whatever it can to hinder the PCs and might try escape or attack if not
properly guarded.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Reversal
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> Opponents for whom flight or surrender is unthinkable often try to change the
situation when defeat looms over them. The opponent does not always try to win
the battle with a single act of desperation or luck. A subtle change in tactics
or shift in position can lead to victory eventually.
<P></P>
The surest and often the most dramatic way to turn the tide is to exploit an
opportunity unique to the current situation. Things that might put an enemy in
peril can provide opportunities. Are there bridge supports to cut? Is the
encounter occurring in a building full of flammable materials? Is there loose snow or
rock overhead that might cause an avalanche?
<P></P>
If the opponents can take advantage of the opportunity without significant
risk or consequence, they should do so immediately. Very often, however, opponents
initially opt for a normal fight or negotiation to avoid undue danger to
themselves.
<P></P>
If the ultimate goal of the battle is to take magical items and other
treasures from the PCs, it’s unlikely that the opponents take actions that might damage
or make those items inaccessible. Spells of destruction (<I>fireball, meteor swarm,</I> and <I>cone of cold</I>) are replaced with spells that neutralize the PCs (<I>slow, time stop,</I> and<I> chaos</I>).
<P></P>
Many opponents hold back their most potent weapons, such as magical items or
spells, and use them only when all else fails. This might seem to contradict the
prior point, but it is usually best to hold something back. An opponent who
reveals the full extent of his strength at the beginning of a confrontation puts
himself at a disadvantage because the PCs can plan and react accordingly. Also,
some powerful weapons (such as a <I>staff of the magi</I>’s retributive strike, a <I>potion of storm giant strength,</I> or the opponent’s only 9th-level spell) can be used only once.
<P></P>
Knowledge can be a potent reserve weapon. Opponents who know the PCs well
might try to break off a fight and negotiate. Perhaps the PCs can be bluffed by
playing on their fears. Perhaps they can be persuaded to redirect their aggression
toward a common foe who is (or appears to be) more dangerous than the their
current enemy.
<P></P>
Desperate opponents might attempt risky maneuvers, such as a called shots
aimed at crippling or disarming the enemy’s lead warrior, charging through the
front rank to attack spellcasters in the rear, or just plain bluffing. These
tactics tend to be dangerous for the person who attempts them, but they have
spectacular results when they work.
