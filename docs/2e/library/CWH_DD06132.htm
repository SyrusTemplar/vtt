<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>Savage Wizard</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Description:</B> The Savage Wizard is the spell
caster of a remote tribe, culturally and technologically primitive by
the standards of the rest of the world. Although these tribes
commonly maintain functional civilizations for thousands of years,
their traditions, dress, and customs are so simple that most
outsiders consider them unsophisticated brutes.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">There are a variety of Savage tribes around the world,
ranging from pacifistic societies of farmers and herders to
bloodthirsty headhunters and barbarians. All, however, are sharply
attuned to the natural world, sharing a deep respect for animal and
plant life and an innate understanding of the mysteries of nature.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">To be a Savage Wizard, a character must have a minimum
Strength score of 11 and a minimum Constitution score of 13.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">To abandon this kit, a character must renounce his
membership with his tribe and become a citizen of a different
culture. Since tribal roots run deep, a dramatic change such as this
should be slow in coming; a Savage Wizard must have advanced at least
five levels since leaving his tribe and experiencing adventures in
the outside world before cutting ties with his tribe.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Preferred Schools:</B> Because their Constitutions
tend to be exceptionally high, Savage Wizards excel in the schools of
conjuration/summoning and invocation/evocation.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Barred Schools:</B> Savage Wizards lack the natural
aptitude for mastering the schools of abjuration and enchantment/charm.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Role:</B> Most tribesmen are dazzled and impressed
by magic, so the Savage Wizard typically holds a position of great
power in his tribe. If not the actual ruler, the Savage Wizard is a
respected teacher or tribal counselor. Depending on the nature of the
tribe, the Savage Wizard is known by a variety of names, among them
Witch Doctor, Mundunugu, Wangateur, and Isangoma.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The Savage Wizard's power can sometimes work against
him, particularly if his tribe is exceptionally superstitious or if
an ambitious tribesman schemes to usurp the wizard's leadership role.
If the tribe becomes convinced that the wizard is consorting with
demons or otherwise stirring up dark forces better left alone, they
may expel the wizard from the tribe with the threat of execution if
he returns. This is one way that a Savage Wizard might link up with
an adventuring party.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">In a campaign, the Savage Wizard takes the role of an
outsider, baffled and intimidated by the mysteries of the
&quot;civilized&quot; world. Products of technology, such as oil
lanterns and crossbows, both fascinate and frighten him. While he is
at home in the darkest jungles or most treacherous mountains, he is
extremely uncomfortable in cities and towns. If the Savage Wizard is
from a relatively pacifistic tribe, he might serve as the conscience
of his party, questioning their eagerness to kill, their obsession
with wealth, their selfishness, and their inequitable system of justice.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Secondary Skills:</B> The Savage Wizard's Secondary
Skill should be based on the primary occupation of his tribe; that
is, if his tribe is mostly fishermen, his Secondary Skill should be
Fishing. Other likely skills include Forester, Groom, Hunter, and Trapper/Furrier.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Weapon Proficiency:</B> Required (one of the
following, representing his tribe's weapon of choice): spear,
blowgun, dagger, knife, or sling. Regardless of whether the Savage
Wizard eventually becomes familiar with new weapons, he is likely to
prefer his tribal weapon throughout his adventuring career.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> (General) Direction
Sense or Weather Sense (player choice); (Warrior) Endurance or
Survival. Recommended: (General) Animal Handling, Animal Training,
Fire-Building, Fishing, Riding (Land- based), Rope Use, Swimming;
(Warrior, double slots) Animal Lore, Bowyer/Fletcher, Hunting,
Mountaineering, Running, Set Snares, Tracking; (Priest, double slots)
Healing, Local History; (Rogue, double slots) Jumping, Tightrope
Walking, Tumbling; (Wizard) Herbalism, Religion. A Savage Wizard
cannot take Etiquette or Heraldry when first created.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Equipment:</B> The only weapon the Savage Wizard
can purchase initially is his tribal weapon (see Weapon Proficiency).
He must spend all of his remaining gold when he is created; he may
not keep any unspent gold. He can purchase only equipment that would
normally be available to his tribe; for instance, his tribe probably
has herbs, nuts, fishing nets, and rafts available, but they are
unlikely to have chains, lanterns, hourglasses, or magnifying
glasses. The DM has the final word as to what equipment is available
to any particular Savage Wizard.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Special Benefits:</B> The Savage Wizard receives
one of the following special abilities from the list below. The
special ability is chosen when the character is first created and can
never be changed.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">1. The Savage Wizard can manufacture a protective
talisman once per week. The talisman is a small pouch of herbs hung
on a leather cord which is worn around the subject's neck. The
talisman gives<I> protection from evil</I> to the wearer, identical
to the effects of the 1st-level wizard spell. The talisman offers
continual protection for a full day, after which time the herbs
disintegrate. <I>Dispel magic</I> or a similar spell permanently
cancels the magic of that particular talisman. The Savage Wizard
requires no less than one hour to manufacture a talisman.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">2. Once per week, the Savage Wizard can construct a
small replicant of any single victim of his choice. The replicant is
about 6 inches tall, made of clay, and crudely resembles the form of
the victim. It must also contain a lock of hair, a fingernail, or
other small piece of organic material from the victim. A Savage
Wizard requires one hour to manufacture a replicant.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Whenever the Savage Wizard cuts a piece from the
replicant, sticks a pin in it, or otherwise &quot;attacks&quot; it,
the replicant suffers 1-4 hit points of damage. The victim who is
represented by the replicant suffers an identical amount of damage,
regardless of the distance between the replicant and the victim
(however, the victim must be on the same plane of existence as the
replicant). Every type of damage on the replicant inflicts 1-4 hit
points of damage; therefore, the Savage Wizard must take care not to
destroy the replicant, for burning, crushing, or throwing the
replicant into a pool of quicksand still inflicts only 1-4 hit points
of damage. The replicant disintegrates when any of the following
conditions are met:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> The replicant has
suffered 10 hit points (or more) of damage.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> <I>Dispel magic</I>
or a similar spell is cast on the replicant.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> A week passes since
the replicant's creation.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">3. Once per week, the Savage Wizard is able to
forecast the general fortunes of some major undertaking by
interpreting an omen from observing the natural conditions around
him. To be receptive to an omen, the wizard must do nothing but
concentrate for one uninterrupted turn; if his concentration is
broken, he cannot attempt to interpret an omen for another week.
After the turn of concentration, he studies his surroundings for an
omen-- a rippling pond, a gathering of clouds, a swarm of insects, or
the veins in a leaf are all possible sources of omens.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">A wizard usually consults an omen before starting a
journey, engaging in a major battle, or embarking on some other
significant task. If the DM has knowledge about the proposed action,
the omen should reveal the appropriate information; for instance, if
the party is considering exploring an abandoned building, but the DM
knows it contains a spectre, the result should be an ill omen. In
situations where the DM has no information on which to base his
judgement, roll 1d10 and consult Table 7.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Special Hindrances:</B> The Savage Wizard's strange
appearance and manners make strangers wary of him. Therefore, he
suffers a -2 reaction adjustment from all NPCs not from his own tribe
(PCs can react as they wish, but they should quickly become
accustomed to the Savage and accept him as an equal. )</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Wealth Options:</B> The Savage Wizard begins with
only (1d4 +1) x 5 gp. As the campaign progresses, the Savage will
have the opportunity to acquire more treasure, and it is up to the
player whether he appreciates its value or rejects it as a worthless.
(For instance, a Savage might accept gold but have a superstitious
belief that requires him to reject gems.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Races:</B> No restrictions.</FONT></P>
