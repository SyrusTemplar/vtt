?? Generally, a paladin is eligible to become a member of an order regardless of
his religion, homeland, or kit. However, an order rarely offers membership to
paladins lower than 9th level (with the exception of the Radiant Heart
Auxiliary, on page 117). The higher the level, the better the chance for an invitation.
<P></P>
?? A paladin may petition a particular order for membership, or a current member
may extend an invitation. In either case, an active member of the order must
agree to sponsor the candidate. The sponsor must be at least one level higher
than the candidate and must be familiar with the candidate's reputation and
achievements. The sponsor formally presents the candidate to a meeting of the entire
membership, who will spend the next full year mulling over his petition. During
that time, active members may observe the candidate in the field and interview
his superiors.
<P></P>
?? At the next annual meeting, the membership votes on the candidate. If a
majority prevail, he's invited to join. Following an initiation ceremony?which may
include prayer services, feasts, and contests?the candidate vows fealty to the
order. The candidate promises:
<P></P>
? To uphold the laws of the order and obey the dictates of the High Officers.
<P></P>
? To attend all meetings, unless unavoidably detained or his absences are
excused in advance. Except for emergencies, meetings are held no more than once or twice a year, usually in a High
Officer's stronghold, a building loaned by a friendly monarch, or an open field.
<P></P>
? To provide aid to any member who asks.
<P></P>
? To display the order's emblem on his coat of arms, shield, or banner, as
determined by the order.

?? An order consists of a variable number of chapters. Each chapter elects its
own officials (called High Officers), sets its own meetings, and establishes its
own bylaws. The High Officers of all chapters hold a special meeting once every
two or three years to exchange information and review policy. The number and
titles of the High Officers vary from order to order, as do the qualifications
for holding office.

<P></P>
<P></P>
?? When accepted as a member of any order, a paladin earns a bonus of 500
experience points. This is a one-time bonus; should he become a member of another
order, he doesn't get an extra 500 points. If he becomes a High Officer, he earns
another 500 points (another one-time bonus).
<P></P>
?? A member of any order may add an honorific title before his name. The DM
should choose titles appropriate to his campaign world. Typical titles include Sir
or Lady, His or Her Excellency, Master or Mistress, the Most Worthy, and the
Most Revered. A High Officer may also add the title of his office after his name.
For instance, a High Officer of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart might
be called Sir Terran of Homewood, Prelate of the Radiant Heart.
<P></P>
?? When displaying his emblem, a member receives a +1 bonus to his reaction rolls
from all lawful and neutral NPCs, familiar with his order.

<P></P>
<P></P>
?? A paladin who violates any of the conditions of his vow to the order is
immediately and permanently dismissed. He loses all benefits of the order, must turn
in his emblem, and may never again become a member of that or any other order.
At the DM's option, any ethos violation may also qualify as grounds for
dismissal.
<P></P>
?? A paladin may appeal his dismissal to the High Officers. If the paladin
committed a minor or inadvertent violation, the High Officers may overturn the
dismissal or suspend his membership for a year or two; he loses all benefits of the
order during that time. When his suspension ends, the High Officers review his
performance, then submit his application to the entire membership. On a majority
vote, the paladin again becomes an active member.
