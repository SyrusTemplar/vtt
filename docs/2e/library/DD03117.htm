<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Bad Tempered:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This character has difficulties with the niceties of social interaction, and
is quick to take insult at any number of slights?real or imagined. The DM
should require the player to make Wisdom/Willpower checks when the character is
given some cause to be insulted. If the check fails, the character is likely to
shoot off his mouth in a rude fashion. (Usually, the bad temper will not cause the
character to attack others, and certainly not with weapons). However, it is
not inconceivable that the character?s remarks will insult the NPC to the point
where combat results. More often, however, the character?s bad temper will cause
a non-violent situation?negotiations with a merchant are broken off, a
nobleman who was thinking of hiring the PCs changes his mind, or a guardsman denies
the party entrance to a city or castle. Dwarves receive 1 extra character point
when they choose this disadvantage.
