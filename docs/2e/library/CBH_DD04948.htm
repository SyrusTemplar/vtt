<B>Specialty:</B> That kit's entertainment form.
<P></P>
<B>Qualifications: </B>Qualifications will limit or extend allowed race, alignment, and ability
scores for the particular kit.
<P></P>
<B>Introduction:</B> This section presents a colorful, first-person example of the kit. Listen to
the NPC as he chats with you about himself and his kind.
<P></P>
<B>Description:</B> This section describes the kit and distinguishes this particular type of bard
from the others.
<P></P>
<B>Role: </B>Role explains the role that this type of bard plays within a party and in
society as a whole.

<B>Secondary Skills:</B> <A HREF="PHB_DD01535.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01535.htm">Secondary skills</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> is an optional rule found in Chapter 5 of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>. If this rule is used, only skills listed in this subsection of the kit can
be selected by characters who adopt this kit.
<P></P>
Weapon Proficiencies: A character can become proficient only in the weapons
listed in this subsection.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Although nonweapon proficiencies are an optional rule, it is strongly
recommended that they be used if bard kits are allowed into the game. They have been
carefully selected to give each kit a unique feel.
<P></P>
<I>Bonuses:</I> Each bard kit has four bonus proficiencies. These proficiencies are gained
without expending any proficiency slots. It is strongly suggested that at least
half of a bard's proficiency slots be spent in one of three ways: gaining
proficiencies from among those on the &quot;Suggested&quot; list, gaining additional topics
(see the chapter on proficiencies) to proficiencies on the Bonus or Suggested
lists, or in improving proficiencies on either list.
<P></P>
<B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Armor restrictions or extensions are listed here. Sometimes special comments
will be made about equipment, such as typical dress, identifying colors,
special tools, and so on.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> Each bard kit has four special benefits. These benefits set the kit off from
all other character classes and kits. The character should take on a different
role-playing feel because of the kit's descriptive information.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> Special hindrances or limitations are placed on certain kits. Hindrances are
listed here only if they do not fall into any subsection listed earlier.
<P></P>
<B>Notes:</B> On rare occasions, this subsection is used to list special notes that don't
fit into any of the earlier subsections.
