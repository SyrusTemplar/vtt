<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Robe of Eyes:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This valuable garment appears to be a normal robe until it is put on. Its
wearer is able to &quot;see'' in all directions at the same moment due to scores of
magical &quot;eyes'' which adorn the robe. The wearer also gains infravision to a range
of 120 feet, and the power to see displaced or out-of-phase objects and
creatures in their actual positions. The <I>robe of eyes</I> sees all forms of invisible things within a 240-foot normal vision range (or
120 feet if <I>infravision</I> is being used).
<P></P>
<I>Invisibility, dust of disappearance, robes of blending,</I> and <I>improved invisibility</I> are not proof against observation, but astral or ethereal things cannot be
seen by means of this robe. Solid objects obstruct even the robe's powers of
observation. Illusions and secret doors also can't be seen, but creatures
camouflaged or hidden in shadows are easily detected, so ambush or surprise of a
character wearing a <I>robe of eyes</I> is impossible.
<P></P>
Finally, the robe enables its wearer to track as if he were a 12th-level
ranger. A <I>light</I> spell thrown directly on a <I>robe of eyes</I> will blind it for 1d3 rounds, a <I>continual light</I> for 2d4 rounds.
