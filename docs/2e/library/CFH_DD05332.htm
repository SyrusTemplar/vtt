<P></P>
The world of piracy doesn't demand that pirates use any specific weapons . . .
but for reasons of tradition and convenience, some specific weapons are very
common to pirate crews.
<P></P>
In addition to the new weapons on the chart above, pirates are readily
familiar with: Battle axe, Bow (all types), Club, Crossbow (all normally-available
types), Dagger/Dirk, Hand/throwing axe, Harpoon, Javelin, Knife, Polearm/Awl pike,
Polearm/Partisan, Scourge (mostly for disciplinary purposes), Sling, Spear,
Sword (all but Khopesh), Trident, and Whip (also mostly for disciplinary
purposes).
<P></P>
Additionally, the world of the Pirate overlapped that of the Swashbuckler to a
considerable degree. With the DM's permission (and there's usually little
reason to deny it), Pirates may have access to all the weapons listed on the chart
above and descriptions below for Swashbucklers.
<P></P>
The new weapons for Pirates include:

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Cutlass</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
The cutlass is a short, heavy sword, sharp along only one edge, with a heavy
basket hilt (a protective cup) around the hilt to protect the hand.
<P></P>
The cutlass' basket hilt provides the following benefits: it gives the wielder
a +1 to attack rolls with the Parry maneuver; and it works just the same as an
iron gauntlet if the wielder wishes to punch someone with the hilt rather than
slash with the blade. (See the <I>Player's Handbook, </I>pages 97-98. Bare-hand attacks do 1d2 damage, plus strength bonus, and the
other effects of punching from the chart on page 97; metal gauntlets and other
metal hand-protection makes that 1d3 plus strength bonus and punching effects.
Note: An enchanted cutlass, say a <I>cutlass +1</I>, does not confer the +1 to attack rolls and damage with these basket-hilt
punches . . . only with blade attacks.)
<P></P>
Proficiency with Cutlass is related to proficiency with short sword,
dagger/dirk, knife/stiletto, and main-gauche. Weapon Specialization with Cutlass is
normal, except that you also get the +1 to attack rolls and +2 damage with those
basket-hilt punches.
<P></P>
In a campaign with pirates, cutlasses are common and readily available in any
port community; they are much less common inland.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The belaying pin is a short rod of wood or metal. It's inserted in a hole
bored through the ship's rail, and ship's ropes are made fast (tied) to it. It can
also be yanked free and brought in violent contact with enemies; in a pirate
fight, anyone who loses a weapon or starts out without one ends up with a
belaying pin in his hand.
<P></P>
Weapon proficiency with Belaying Pin is related to clubs and maces; if you
have proficiency with club or mace, you take only a ?1 when using a belaying pin
you don't have proficiency for. Weapon specialization with belaying pin gives
the usual benefits.
<P></P>
Belaying pins are very available on any ship; you can get any number of them
at a seaside town or city, especially at a shipbuilder's, a warehouse, or a
business that supplies ships.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Gaff/Hook
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The gaff is a metal hook with a wooden or metal crossbar at the base; it's
held in one hand, the hook protruding between the middle and ring fingers, and
normally used to hook and land fish.
<P></P>
However, like the belaying pin, it's in ready supply onboard a ship. Also,
many pirates who lose a hand have a cup with a gaff on it attached to the stump,
and so always have a weapon &quot;on hand&quot;?one that can't be dropped or Disarmed.
<P></P>
Proficiency with the gaff is not related to any other proficiency.
Specialization grants the usual benefits.
