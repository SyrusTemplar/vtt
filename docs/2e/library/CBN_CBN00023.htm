</FONT><FONT SIZE="3">In addition to the new wizard kits described herein, a few kits outlined in
the <I>Complete Wizard’s Handbook (WH)</I> and the <I>Complete Sha’ir’s Handbook (SH)</I> may be appropriate for a necromancer: specifically, the Academician, Militant
Wizard, Peasant Wizard, Savage Wizard, and the Witch (from the <I>WH</I>), and the Astrologer, Ghul Lord, and the Mystic of Nog (from the<I> SH</I>). Of all the wizard kits outlined in these two resources, the Witch and Ghul
Lord stand out as particularly interesting and distinctive roles for the
necromancer in the campaign. The full details of these kits can be found in the<I> WH</I> and<I> SH</I>, respectively. Only a few remarks about each profession are offered as
inspiration for the DM.
