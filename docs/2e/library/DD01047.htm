<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Scarab of Protection:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">This device appears to be any one of the various magical amulets, stones, etc.
It gives off a faint magical aura, however, and if it is held for one round,
an inscription will appear on its surface letting the holder know it is a
protective device.
<P></P>
The possessor gains a +1 bonus to all saving throws vs. spell. If no save is
normally possible, he gets a one in 20 chance of saving, adjusted by any other
magical protections that normally give bonuses to saving throws. Thus, this
device allows a saving throw vs. spell at base 20 against <I>magic missile</I> attacks, for example. If the target also has a +4 bonus for magical armor and
a +1 bonus for a <I>ring of protection,</I> any roll of 15 or better would indicate that the missiles did no damage.
<P></P>
The scarab can also absorb up to 12 level-draining attacks (two level drains
count as two absorbings), <I>death touches, death rays,</I> or <I>fingers of death.</I> However, upon absorbing 12 such attacks the scarab turns to powder-totally
destroyed.
<P></P>
One in 20 of these scarabs will be a cursed item, giving the possessor a -2
penalty to his saving throws. However, one in five of these cursed items will
become a +2 scarab if the curse is removed by a cleric of 16th-level or higher. In
this case, the scarab will have absorption capability of 24 rather than 12.
