<I>Bigby's grasping hand</I> is a superior version of the 6th-level spell <I>Bigby's forceful hand</I>. It creates a man-sized (5 feet) to gargantuan-sized (21 feet) hand that
appears and grasps a creature designated by the caster, regardless of what the
spellcaster does or how the opponent tries to escape it. The grasping hand can hold
motionless a creature or object of up to 1,000 pounds weight, slow movement to
10 feet per round if the creature weighs between 1,000 and 4,000 pounds, or
slow movement by 50% if the creature weighs up to 16,000 pounds. The hand itself
inflicts no damage. The grasping hand has an Armor Class of 0, has as many hit
points as its caster in full health, and vanishes when destroyed. The caster
can order it to release a trapped opponent or can dismiss it on command.

The material component is a leather glove.
