For the duration of this spell, a priest becomes completely deaf to all normal
sounds and may hear only the noise of other creatures? beating hearts. The
heartbeat of each person, animal, or monster in the area of effect is clearly
distinct and may convey information about the being?s proximity, direction, size,
emotional distress, general health, and race or species. For instance, the
heartbeat of a frail old wizard would be much softer and weaker than that of the <I>invisible</I> ogre bodyguard, standing behind him. This spell can provide quite confusing
results if cast in the presence of numerous individuals (such as on a crowded
city street) and is most effective when cast by a cleric in relative seclusion. A
priest never hears his or her own heartbeat with this spell. It is effectively
masked out by the power of the <I>hear heartbeat</I> spell.
<P></P>
Obviously, this spell is of little use with creatures without functioning
hearts (such as plants or undead). The spell?s range is diminished if more than a
one-inch thickness of wood, stone, or metal lies between the caster and a
subject. Each inch of a barrier?s thickness should be treated as 10? of open space.
<P></P>
The material component is beeswax mixed with a tiny drop of the priest?s own
blood (to block the sound of his or her own heartbeat). While casting the spell,
the priest places the wax in his ears to blot out normal sound and trigger the
magical effect. Note that the priest is completely oblivious to normal sounds
(such as talking or music) while the spell is in effect.
