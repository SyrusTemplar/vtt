This spell is exactly the same as the 4th-level wizard spell <I>Otiluke's resilient sphere,</I> with the addition that the creatures or objects inside the globe are nearly
weightless--anything contained within it weighs only 1/16 its normal weight. Any
subject weighing up to 5,000 pounds can be telekinetically lifted in the
sphere by the caster. Range of control extends to a maximum distance of 10 yards per
level after the sphere has actually succeeded in encapsulating a subject or
subjects. Note that even if more than 5,000 pounds of weight is englobed, the
perceived weight is only 1/16 of the actual weight, so the orb can be rolled
without exceptional effort. Because of the reduced weight, rapid motion or falling
within the field of the sphere is relatively harmless to the object therein,
although it can be disastrous should the globe disappear when the subject inside
is high above a hard surface. The caster can dismiss the effect with a word.

In addition to a hemispherical piece of diamond and a matching piece of gum
arabic, the caster must also have a pair of small bar magnets as material
components for this spell.
