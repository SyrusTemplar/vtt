   The ADVANCED DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS® 2nd Edition <I>Player's Handbook</I> and <I>DUNGEON MASTER® Guide</I> contain all the basic information you need to create and play ranger
characters. But for players wanting to go a bit deeper, <I>The Complete Ranger's Handbook</I> provides a wealth of detail that expands on that basic information, adding
more options and rules to make your rangers come alive like never before.
<P></P>
   For instance, we'll examine the ranger's talents for tracking, animal empathy,
and nature lore, suggesting methods for using these abilities in ways you
might not have considered. If you've wondered what a ranger does with his followers
or exactly how he acquires them, you'll find the answers here. If you're tired
of playing ordinary rangers, there's more than a dozen new character kits for
your perusal, including the Giant Killer, the Pathfinder, and the Stalker.
There are also plenty of new spells, proficiencies, and equipment to expand your
ranger's horizons. Use what you like and ignore what you don't.
<P></P>
   Though much of this material will be of interest to the Dungeon Master,
particularly the clarification of old concepts and the introduction of new rules,<I> The Complete Ranger's Handbook</I> is a supplement to the <I>Player's Handbook</I>. Every word is intended for the players. Note, however, that all of material
is optional, and none may be incorporated into a campaign without the express
permission of the DM. These caveats aside, feel free to turn the page and enjoy.
