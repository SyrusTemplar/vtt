This spell changes the appearance of a single unit so it resembles another
unit. The <I>disguise</I> can cause the affected creatures to appear to be of another class,
nationality, rank, race, alignment, or military affiliation (i.e., a unit from one army
may appear wearing the armor and carrying the colors of another army). <I>Disguise</I> cannot change the size category of the unit's members. Thus, a unit of humans
may appear to be a unit of elves, but may not appear as a unit of giants or
halflings. The spell does not affect the size of the overall unit; a unit of 50
creatures will still appear to be a unit of 50 creatures.
<P></P>
The disguised unit may appear to be carrying any melee or personal missile
weapons (e.g., axes, long swords, crossbows, etc.), and may appear to be wearing
any type of armor. In combat, however, the unit attacks and defends with its
real weapons and armor regardless of the gear they may appear to be carrying.
<P></P>
<I>Disguise</I> is most effective at long range. If another unit moves within 20 yards of a
disguised unit, it automatically sees through the illusion.
<P></P>
The caster automatically sees through the illusion. Members of the subject
unit see no change in their appearance. <I>True seeing</I> or similar magic is required for other individuals to see through the
disguise (unless they move within 20 yards of the unit).
<P></P>
The material components are a fine silk veil and a length of woven platinum
wire. The wire is consumed during the casting.
