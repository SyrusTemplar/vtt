Almost all halflings suffer to some degree from feelings which resembles the
condition humans call agoraphobia--a fear of unknown or open places. It's not
that halflings are literally <I>afraid</I>, merely that they become very uncomfortable whenever they're too far away
from their villages and burrows or in unfamiliar places. Whether this is one of
Yondalla's 'gifts,' designed to keep them close to home and hearth, or a holdover
from the Bad Old Days when enemies lurked behind every tree and bush, none can
say. But it has been observed that the symptoms increase with age--halfling
children freely range far and wide, while the very old rarely step outside their
burrows. Not that the halflings see this as a bad thing: to them, it's simply
the way things are and ought to be--youth is the time to gadabout, age the time
for rest and reflection.
