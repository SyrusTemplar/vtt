Some characters--the paladin, in particular--possess a limited ability to
detect alignments, particularly good and evil. Even this power has more limitations
than the player is likely to consider. The ability to detect evil is really
only useful to spot characters or creatures with evil intentions or those who are
so thoroughly corrupted that they are evil to the core, not the evil aspect of
an alignment.
<P></P>
Just because a fighter is chaotic evil doesn't mean he can be detected as a
source of evil while he is having a drink at the tavern. He may have no
particularly evil intentions at that moment. At the other end of the spectrum, a
powerful, evil cleric may have committed so many foul and hideous deeds that the aura
of evil hangs inescapably over him.
