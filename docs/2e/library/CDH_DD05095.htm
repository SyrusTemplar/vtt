When not adventuring, druids prefer to live near a <I>sacred grove</I> and worship there as well. While the term &quot;sacred grove&quot; usually calls to
mind a stand of trees within a forest, here it refers to any sacred place where
druids worship Nature. All sacred groves are places of great natural beauty--and
sometimes magical power. Areas with a history of druidic veneration tend to
acquire wondrous abilities from their prolonged contact with druidic magic and
rites.
<P></P>
Sometimes several druids share a single sacred grove. This arrangement enables
them to take turns adventuring or traveling, leaving someone always on hand to
protect and tend the grove. Druids occupying a sacred grove singly have to
arrange for its safety before departing: setting various wards and traps, or
arranging for allies to protect it in the druid's absence.
