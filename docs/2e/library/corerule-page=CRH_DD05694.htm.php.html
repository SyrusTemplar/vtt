<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Many characters regard animals as
non-thinking beasts that react purely on instinct, incapable of
responding to reason. The ranger, on the other hand, sees animals as
emotionally complex creatures whose fears and desires may be less
sophisticated than those of humans, but are no less real. This innate
understanding of animal behavior gives the ranger a limited ability
to influence their emotions and manipulate their behavior.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The ranger knows the meaning of a
twitching tail, a cocked head, a low growl. He knows that a snarling
wolf positioned in a crouch may be more frightened than hostile. If
approached correctly, a hissing snake may slither away rather than
strike. By calling on his animal empathy, a ranger can use soothing
words and gestures to turn hostility to indifference, and
indifference to friendship.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Conditions</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A ranger can't influence an animal's
reactions at will. The following limitations apply:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The animal must be native to the real
world; natural animals.</B> Rangers can't modify the reactions of
supernatural creatures (skeletons and ghouls), magical creatures
(basilisks and golems), or creatures of extra-planar origin (aerial
servants and elementals). The ranger can affect giant animals.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The animal must be intelligent, but
not exceptionally so.</B> To respond to a ranger's words and
gestures, the animal must be able to comprehend them. In practice,
this means that a ranger can't use this ability to influence the
behavior of non-intelligent animals (those with Intelligence scores
of zero) such as centipedes or barracudas. Conversely, creatures of
higher intelligence, such as leprechauns, ogres, and a paladin's
warhorse, resist the ranger's <I>animal empathy</I>. As a rule of
thumb, rangers can only use this ability on natural animals whose
intelligence ranges from Animal to Low (Intelligence score of 1 to 7).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The animal can't be the ranger's
species enemy.</B> A ranger who confronts the species enemy is too
overwhelmed by intense emotions to establish the proper empathy.
Therefore, a ranger can never modify the reaction of his species
enemy using this ability.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The ranger must remain calm.</B> The
ranger must move towards the animal quietly, slowly, and confidently,
all the while speaking soothing words and making calming gestures.
Fear cannot be shown, nor a weapon wielded, nor any action taken that
might frighten or enrage the animal.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The ranger must be distanced from the
rest of the party.</B> If the ranger approaches with companions, the
animal will react to the presence of all the characters, not just the
ranger. The ranger's efforts to soothe the animal will go unnoticed.
Ideally, the rest of the party will be out of the animal's sight when
the ranger approaches. If this is impractical, the ranger's
companions should be at least 10 feet behind him, remaining quiet and
taking no actions that the animal might interpret as hostile.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The animal must be able to hear and
see the ranger. </B>The ranger must be in plain sight for the animal
to size up; the ranger may not be concealed in the brush, hidden in
shadows, or have erected any type of physical barrier between himself
and the animal. The animal must also be able to hear the ranger,
meaning that the area must be relatively quiet, free of distracting
or disturbing sounds. In most cases, the ranger must be within a few
feet of the animal, or close enough for the animal to see the
ranger's eyes. The DM may make exceptions in special circumstances.
For instance, if the ranger approaches an animal in total darkness,
the DM may rule that soothing words are sufficient to calm the
animal. In situations where silence is imperative, gestures alone may
suffice. However, in all cases, the ranger must still be relatively
close to the animal to modify its reaction.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The ranger must soothe the animal for
an uninterrupted period.</B> A ranger can't attempt to soothe an
animal that's charging or attacking; the animal must be stationary or
moving only slightly (a pacing wolf, a weaving serpent). Once the
ranger moves close to the animal, the creature must be soothed for
5-10 (1d6+4) uninterrupted rounds; the DM may increase this time if
the animal is unusually anxious or exceptionally hostile. (This time
can be lapsed by the DM if nothing else is going on.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A ranger who meets these conditions can
use animal empathy in an attempt to modify the animal's reactions.
Though the game result is the same, technique differs depending
whether the animal is wild or domestic.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Wild Animals</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; This group includes animals not normally
domesticated, such as lions, snakes, and rats. It also includes
domesticated animals that have been trained to attack, such as dogs.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the ranger attempts to soothe a
wild animal, the DM must determine the animal's current attitude,
taking into account its natural temperament (Is it naturally
aggressive, or inclined to flee rather than fight?), immediate
conditions (Did it just wake up? Is it sick or wounded? Hungry?) and
pre-existing circumstances (Has it recently been harassed or
befriended by characters similar in appearance to the ranger? Is it
guarding its nest or lair?) The DM should then select the animal's
current attitude from Table 30. The attitude should not be announced
(&quot;The wolf is Cautious.&quot;). Instead, clearly describe the
animal's appearance and behavior and let the ranger come to his own
conclusions (&quot;The wolf paces back and forth, eyes darting. It
begins to snarl as you approach.&quot;).</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; To determine if the ranger is able to
modify the reaction of a wild animal, the animal must make a saving
throw vs. rods (even though the ranger's animal empathy ability isn't
magical). As shown on Table 31, the ranger's experience level imposes
a penalty to the creature's roll.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If the animal fails its saving throw, the
ranger has successfully modified its behavior. The attitude of the
animal shifts one category, up or down, on Table 30 as decided by the
ranger. If the animal was Indifferent, it now becomes either Cautious
or Friendly, and behaves accordingly. This new reaction applies only
to the ranger. An animal that the ranger changed from Threatening to
Cautious may still behave in a Threatening manner to other members of
the party, particularly if another character decides to interfere
with the ranger's efforts or otherwise draws attention to himself.
However, as long as the ranger stays near the animal and continues to
soothe it, the animal's attention will remain focused on the ranger,
and it will remain Cautious. After the ranger leaves the area, the
animal's attitude remains altered for a short time (from a few
minutes to an hour, as decided by the DM) before it reverts to its
original disposition.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If the animal succeeds in its saving
throw, it resists the ranger's efforts and its attitude remains
unchanged. The ranger notices no significant difference in the
animal's behavior. An Indifferent animal continues to ignore the
ranger, a Hostile animal may suddenly charge him. The ranger can't
make a second attempt to modify its behavior.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Domestic Animals</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; This group includes animals that have
non-hostile dispositions and are routinely domesticated, such as
horses and dogs. It also includes formerly wild animals, such as
bears and monkeys, that have been tamed and now are comfortable
around people.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Such animals are presumed to be
Frightened, Friendly, Indifferent, or Cautious. Regardless of their
initial disposition, when a ranger approaches and soothes them, they
become Friendly. No saving throws are necessary; this change is
automatic. It's also permanent, so long as the ranger stays in sight
of the animal. If the ranger leaves the area, the animal reverts to
its original disposition a short time later (within a few minutes to
an hour).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The attitude change applies to the ranger
only; an Indifferent dog feels Friendly to the ranger but remains
oblivious to the ranger's companions. A Cautious horse is Friendly to
the ranger and will carry him on its back, but bucks furiously if
anyone else attempts to mount it.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, the ranger can ascertain
the general qualities of any domestic animal he befriends. By
observation alone, he could determine:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Which puppy in a
litter will become the best hunter and most loyal companion.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Which horse at a
sale is the healthiest, strongest, and fastest mount.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Which sheep in a
flock will produce the highest quality wool.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Which sow in a sty
will give birth to the largest broods.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The DM should provide any information of
this type that the ranger wants to know, though he should refrain
from answering specific questions. For instance, the ranger can
determine which horse in a corral is the fastest, but he can't tell
the horse's exact speed just by observing it.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A special case occurs if an animal has
been attack-trained. This is most usual in the case of dogs, horses,
and hunting birds such as falcons, but might apply to other animals,
such as bears or leopards. These are treated as wild animals, and
receive the saving throw vs. rods to resist the ranger's empathy as
described above.</FONT></P>
