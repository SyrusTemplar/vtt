<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A group of five dwarves led by a 6th/6th-level fighter/cleric has located a
fortified goblin village. They hunker down in an ancient ruin about 300 yards
from the village walls to discuss plans. Unfortunately for the dwarves, an alert
sentry has spotted them and the goblins ready their medium catapult for a shot
at the intruders. The dwarves have taken cover behind an old stone wall 12 feet
high; they sit with their backs to the wall while they talk. Because the
dwarves are within 8 feet of the wall, the catapult cannot target them. Even if the
dwarves were in the open, the catapult could only target their area because they
are Man-sized creatures.
<P></P>
The goblins decide to fire at the top of the wall and hope for the best. The
wall is stationary and several hundred feet long. However, the goblins are
aiming at one specific section, so the DM decides there is no attack bonus. Because
the dwarves are the true target of the attack, the DM decides to impose the
standard –4 penalty for 90% concealment (it might be a fairly easy task to hit the
wall, but it’s a bit more difficult to strike the section of wall directly
above the dwarves’ heads). The goblins have the catapult loaded with a mass of
small stones, which gives them an extra die of damage against creatures (4d10
points of damage in this case). The attack roll is a 12, a miss. (A medium
catapult’s THAC0 is 15, so the goblins needed to roll a 19 or better to hit.) The
goblins roll 1d8 for scatter and get a 3, indicating an overshot to the right. The
goblins now roll 2d6 for distance and the result is a 7, so stone shot impacts 7
squares away from the aiming point, too far away to score any incidental hits
on the dwarves (see diagram 14).

When they see the catapult stones dropping beyond them, the dwarves decide to
leave, intending to exit through the far side of the ruins and return home. The
medium catapult is reloading and cannot fire again before the dwarves get
away. Unfortunately, the goblins also have two light catapults, and the sentry
alerts their crews to the dwarves’ flight.
<P></P>
Because the dwarves’ movement takes them more than 8 feet away from the wall,
the light catapults can hit them. The goblins must fire at the area where the
dwarves are. Their attacks receive a –3 penalty for targets moving faster than 3
but slower than 12. The crews have an adjusted THAC0 of 17 for these shots.
The first crew rolls a 6, a miss, but the second crew gets a 20, a hit. The
scatter and direction dice place the miss too far away to hurt the dwarves. Because
the catapult that hit was firing at an area containing small targets, the hit
also scatters. The goblins roll a 2, indicating a straight overshot. Because the
shot was a hit, the goblins roll 1d4 for distance and get a 1, so the shot
lands right in front of the dwarves. The leader and two dwarves are within the
area of effect. The two dwarves are one-Hit-Die creatures and they have no cover,
so they are not allowed a saving throw. The damage roll is a 16, which kills
both dwarves. The leader is allowed a saving throw vs. petrification to avoid the
damage and the roll is successful. The leader takes no damage and beats a
hasty retreat with his three surviving followers.

Later that day, a monstrous 20' umber hulk (a true mutant — it is considered
size Huge for the purposes of this example) bursts from the ground and attacks a
goblin patrol about 200 yards from the village. If the umber hulk were much
closer, it would be within the minimum range for the catapults (150 yards). Most
of the patrol flees, leaving one unfortunate comrade trapped in the umber
hulk’s mandibles. The medium catapult cannot target on Huge creatures, so it must
fire at the area containing the umber hulk. The crew selects a square next to the
umber hulk as the intended impact square (they hope to score a lucky direct
hit by rolling the right combination of scatter and distance dice). The umber
hulk remains in place while crushing its goblin meal, but part of its body remains
hidden below ground, so the DM applies a –1 penalty to the shot for 25%
concealment, giving the medium catapult an adjusted THAC0 of 16. The goblins roll an
11, a miss. The scatter die is a 7, short and to the left; the roll for
distance is a 6, and the shot lands too far away from the umber hulk to do any damage.
Unfortunately, two of the fleeing goblins are in the shot’s area of effect and
are killed (see diagram 16).

The two light catapults can fire at Huge creatures. With the –1 modifier for
concealment, the light catapults have adjusted THAC0s of 15. The attack rolls
are 15 and 6. The first shot hits the umber hulk, and because of the direct hit,
the umber hulk gets no saving throw and suffers 3d10 points of damage from it
(the goblins are still using masses of small stones). The miss scatters, using
the square containing the umber hulk’s head as the intended impact square. The
roll is a 2, a straight overshot. The distance roll also is a 2, which places
the umber hulk within the shot’s area of effect in spite of the miss. The umber
hulk has 8+8 Hit Dice and gets a saving throw vs. petrification to avoid damage;
it rolls a 19, easily succeeding. Nevertheless, the direct hit convinces it to
retreat below ground with its prize.
