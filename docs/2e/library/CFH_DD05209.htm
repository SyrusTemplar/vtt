There are four common Fighting Styles employed by anyone using a melee weapon.
They are:
<P></P>
<B>Single-Weapon Style:</B> The character wields a weapon in one hand and carries nothing in the other
hand. The weapon can be as short as a Dagger or as long as a Bastard Sword or
Long Spear.
<P></P>
<B>Two-Hander Style:</B> The character wields a weapon which requires (or at least accommodates) the
use of two hands. Such weapons include those which require two hands (Two-Handed
Sword, Polearms, and Quarterstaff, for instance) and those which can be used
one-and two-handed (Bastard Sword and Spear, for example).
<P></P>
<B>Weapon and Shield Style: </B>The character wields a weapon in his good hand and carries a shield on his
off-hand. This combination can vary from a street-bravo's choice of dagger and
small buckler to the classic knight's choice of long sword and body shield.
<P></P>
<B>Two-Weapon Style:</B> The character wields one weapon in each hand. Unless both weapons are Small
(S on the Size column on the Weapons chart), the weapon in the character's
off-hand must be lighter in weight than his primary weapon. This character can vary
from a street-thief wielding two identical daggers, to a fencer using a rapier
in one hand and a main-gauche in another, to a heavily-armored warrior with a
long sword in one hand and a short sword in the other. Note: Read the <I>Player?s Handbook</I>, <A HREF="PHB_DD01697.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="PHB_DD01697.htm">page 96k</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, for the rules on Attacking with Two Weapons.
<P></P>
All Warriors start play knowing how to use all four styles. Priests start play
knowing how to use Single-Weapon, Two-Hander, and Weapon and Shield styles.
Rogues start play knowing how to use Single-Weapon, Two-Hander, and Two-Weapon
styles. Wizards start play knowing how to use Single-Weapon and Two-Hander
styles. Characters cannot learn new styles after they're created; these are the
styles they are limited to by their choice of character class.
<P></P>
A character can use a weapon style he knows with a weapon he does not know how
to use. For example, wizards know Two-Hander style . . . so they can learn to
use a quarterstaff. If a wizard who doesn't have Proficiency with a
quarterstaff picks one up, he can still use the weapon in two hands. However, he suffers
the ?5 attack penalty required by his unfamiliarity and his character class.
<P></P>
Each style confers some basic advantages and disadvantages when used. These
are described in the descriptions of each individual style, below. Additionally,
characters can <I>specialize</I> in these styles. Single-class warriors can eventually specialize in all of
them; other classes can only specialize in one style.
