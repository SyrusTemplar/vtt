<B>Specialty:</B> Actor/Mime.
<P></P>
<B>Qualifications:</B> Standard ability scores.
<P></P>
<B>Introduction:</B> <I>I am Glateela the Thespian. I would like to invite you to the performance of
the &quot;Green Dragon and Golden Knight,&quot; given this weeks' end in the Old King's
Theater. I will be playing Maiden Zephnia.
<P></P>
I have played various roles on the Old King's stage for the past four years.
Acting is a wonderful occupation. I'm always busy learning parts, performing,
and teaching the young children. When I'm not performing, some courtly gentleman
or other has me over for blackroot tea. I'm on a first-name basis with the city
mayor, all of the ranking constables, and even the Duke knows me.
<P></P>
What few people realize is that I'm sister to the infamous wanderer
Hanalacious, and we often adventure together. Hanalacious is actually a warrior. Her
reputation as a bard is a result of my dressing up as her double and acting the
part. In this way, the legend of Hanalacious grows with a speed that would be
impossible for any single human.
<P></P>
Unknown even to Hana is the fact that I occasionally play other off-stage
roles. This is the real thrill of being a Thespian. You can be anyone you want if
you are good enough.
<P></P>
Hope to see you this weekend. And if you whisper a word of my secret to
anyone, you'd best beware of everyone you meet, for one of them will be me in
disguise and I will silence your loose tongue forever.
<P></P>
</I> <B>Description:</B> Of all the various types of bards, Thespians put the most time and energy
into performances. Thespians are actors. They display their talents in plays,
skits, and dramatic productions. Some even perform in streets or village squares.
When a Thespian isn't acting, he is likely writing scripts or reading for
upcoming parts.
<P></P>
Thespians are somewhat like, yet unlike, Charlatans. Where Charlatans act to
deceive, Thespians act to make others believe. Because of their similar methods,
Thespians have some skills in common with Charlatans.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> Thespians rarely travel from town to town unless they are on an acting tour.
Even if they are on tour, they often return to their established home. Most
Thespians belong to the local actor's guild and take part in regularly scheduled
performances.
<P></P>
Occasionally, Thespians are secretly hired to serve as spies, or temporarily
fill in for a missing person. The great Thespian Hanalacious once filled in as
the Lord Mayor of the Free City of Greyhawk for over a month while the real
mayor was away on secret errands.
<P></P>
The adventuring Thespian is a rare person (player characters represent almost
all of them). Such Thespians are often out for &quot;field research.&quot; After all, if
you want to play the part of a mighty warrior, what better practice than to go
dungeoneering? Other Thespians adventure for the thrill of it all. They look
upon such activity as taking a part in the &quot;Grand Play of Life.&quot; Such Thespians
often go to any length to mold the adventure into a dramatic production with
themselves as the stars-often to the chagrin of their fellow party members.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> Any.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Since they are actors, Thespians spend a lot of time practicing with all
types of weapons, in order to make their plays more realistic. This produces a
unique situation. Thespians understand the showy stage methods for using most
weapons, but they rarely practice with any one weapon long enough to become truly
proficient at it.
<P></P>
As a result, 1st-level Thespians are proficient only with the dagger. At 2nd
level they become proficient with the knife, and at 5th level Thespians gain
their final weapon proficiency--the short sword.
<P></P>
This restriction is partially offset by the fact that a Thespian suffers only
a -2 nonproficiency penalty (equal to that of warriors) on all other weapons
because of practicing with these weapons during rehearsals.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonuses:</I> Acting, Disguise, Languages (modern), Reading/Writing. <I>Suggested:</I> Artistic Ability, Crowd Working, Dancing, Etiquette, Jumping, Languages
(ancient), Musical Instrument, Poetry, Reading Lips, Seamstress/Tailor, Singing,
Tumbling, Ventriloquism, Weaving.
<P></P>
<B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Again, Thespians are actors and don all forms of armor for their various
roles. This sets them apart from the norm. As a result, they can wear any form of
armor and even carry shields. However, they incur a +1 Armor Class penalty when
wearing armor that is not standard for the bard character class (their
understanding of these armor types is imperfect). Thespians have no real understanding
of shields; though they can carry shields, they gain no Armor Class bonus for
the effort.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:
<P></P>
</B> <I>General Acting:</I> Thespians are masterful actors. Using this ability, they can act as if a
light blow was fatal, pretend to faint, or exaggerate their abilities. These skills
are required on stage, but are also very useful during adventures.
<P></P>
Once, Hanalacious's band came upon a camp of six ogres. Realizing that they
were outmatched, Hana leapt forward to meet the charging ogres. She acted as if
the first strike against her was a fatal blow. The ogres believed this and
charged on to attack the rest of the band. With the time that Hana had bought
herself, she managed to unpack her fireball scroll and succeeded in roasting the
ogres and saving the day.
<P></P>
Hana's finest performance occurred in the famous dungeons of the Greyhawk
ruins. Here, she came upon Farcluun, a great red dragon. During the next four
hours, Hanalacious was involved in the most dangerous role she ever played. When she
saw the great wyrm, she quickly disguised herself as Zagig Yragerne, the
original founder of Greyhawk Castle. Entering the cavern of Farcluun, Hana played up
her knowledge, wisdom, and magical prowess. In the end, she cowed Farcluun and
actually had the dragon huddled in a corner with threats of turning its life's
treasure trove into an ant hill.
<P></P>
Acting functions in much the same way as illusion spells. If the audience
believes the act, then it works without question. If the audience is skeptical,
they are allowed to roll a saving throw vs. spell with a -1 penalty for every
three levels of the Thespian. If the saving throw succeeds, they realize that the
Thespian is acting; otherwise, they accept the act.
<P></P>
Of course, acts can go only so far. It is impossible to act as if you are
lifting a 700-pound boulder over your head unless you have the aid of magic (or a
Strength of 20 or more).
<P></P>
<I>Spell Acting:</I> Any Thespian who has taken the spellcraft proficiency can act as if he can
cast powerful spells. To put on such a performance, the Thespian must be easily
viewed by all who will be affected. The Thespian then stands up, chants arcane
words, gestures, and tosses &quot;magical&quot; powder about. During the spell acting, the
Thespian directs his attention and gestures toward the intended targets of the
spell. After one round, the targets must roll a successful morale check or
flee in terror.
<P></P>
If the Thespian actually casts a flashy spell during the act (<I>e.g., burning hands</I>), the morale check is made with a penalty equal to the spell's level. Imagine
what you would think if a wizard's hands sprouted flame while he chanted and
made gestures of doom in your direction.
<P></P>
<I>Influence Reactions:</I> Thespians can influence the reactions of those they meet by trying to act in
an appealing manner. After 1d10 rounds of such a performance, those associating
with the Thespian roll a saving throw vs. paralyzation with a -1 penalty per
three levels of the Thespian. If they fail the saving throw, their initial
reactions are altered one level in the direction that the Thespian desires. If the
saving throw succeeds, the audience realizes that the Thespian is acting and
their reactions are adjusted one level in the opposite direction.
<P></P>
<I>Observe Motions:</I> As actors, Thespians are trained to observe the motions of others. Usually
they use this skill to see cues from fellow actors during a performance. This
ability also enables them to predict the movements of opponents during combat.
<P></P>
In any round that a Thespian wins initiative, he gains a +2 bonus to his Armor
Class and saving throws and a +1 bonus to attack rolls.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> None.
