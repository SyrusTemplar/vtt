<TITLE>Glibness-- Trait (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
<script src="jscripts.js"></script><link rel="stylesheet" href="toc.css"></HEAD><BODY>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Glibness:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The character has the knack of dissuading the suspicions of NPCs. The PC must
speak the same language as those he is trying to impress, and players are
encouraged to role-play the glibness attempt.
<P></P>
Situations where this might arise include characters trying to talk their way
past the guards at a city gate, turning aside the hostility of a bullying thug,
or disarming the suspicions of a merchant who suspects the PCs of thievery.
Characters can make Wisdom/Intuition checks to see if their glibness is
successful.
<P></P>
Of course, if the guards are looking for a smuggler that fits one of the
characters? descriptions, or the bully really wants to beat up, say, a blond elven
rogue, or the merchant saw the fellow steal a bracelet, no glibness attempt is
possible.
<P></P>
Halflings can purchase this trait for 1 less character point than the listed
amount.
