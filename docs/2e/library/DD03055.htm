<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Jumping:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> This skill means that a character has unusual abilities to jump across
distances, leap incredible heights, and vault with a pole.
<P></P>
A human or elven character with the jumping proficiency can perform a running
broad jump of 20 feet without a proficiency check; a jump of more than 20 feet
requires a check, with a –1 modifier for each foot above 20. The jumper can do
a standing broad jump of 8 feet without a check; longer jumps require
proficiency checks with the same penalties.
<P></P>
The character can high jump 4 feet without a check, higher obstacles require a
check, with a –1 modifier for every 6&quot; of additional height. If jumping from a
standing start, the beginning height is 3 feet, not 4 feet.
<P></P>
Dwarves, gnomes, and halflings are more limited in their jumping ability. For
these characters, the basic distances in each category are reduced to 75% of
the listed amount—e.g. 15 feet instead of 20 for the broad jump.
<P></P>
A vaulting pole must be at least as tall as the character using it, but no
more than twice as tall. The character can vault over obstacles up to the height
of the pole. If the obstacles are within 2 feet of the pole’s length, however,
the character must make a proficiency check. The vaulter can also jump across a
space no more than 11_2 the width of the pole’s length. If the gap is greater
than the length of the pole, a proficiency check is required.
