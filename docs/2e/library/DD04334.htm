This spell turns the subject into a &quot;thought broadcaster.&quot; For the duration of
the spell, everyone within 30 yards of the subject senses the subject's
thoughts, making it impossible for him to lie, keep secrets, conceal motives, etc.
The subject is not automatically aware that his thoughts are being sensed.
Everyone who senses these thoughts, on the other hand, knows their source.
<P></P>
This spell causes the broadcast of only surface thoughts and motivations, not
memories. There is no need for a common language between broadcaster and
receivers; for this purpose, thoughts are considered to be symbolic, not dependent on
language. The detail level of the thoughts is insufficient for others to learn
specific skills from the subject. Thus, if the subject casts a spell, everyone
within range knows what spell is being cast before it takes effect, but no one
learns any knowledge about how the spell is cast.
<P></P>
If the broadcaster is <I>invisible</I> or hiding in shadows, the broadcast functions normally, and all receivers are
aware that someone is in the vicinity whom they cannot see. While receivers
cannot pinpoint the broadcaster's location, the broadcaster's thoughts will
inevitably reveal his general position (&quot;Oh no, he's looking right at me,&quot; etc.). A
character hiding in shadows will be automatically detected, while attacks
against an <I>invisible</I> broadcaster suffer a -2 penalty, rather than the normal -4. This spell
totally negates the chance of surprise by the broadcaster.
<P></P>
The subject must have an Intelligence score of 1 or more to become a
broadcaster, and must have a &quot;normal&quot; mind as understood by PCs. Thoughts that are
broadcast can be received only by individuals with Intelligence scores of 3 or
better. An unwilling subject receives a normal saving throw vs. spell to avoid the
effects. A willing subject can waive this saving throw.
<P></P>
The material component is small balloon that the priest inflates upon casting.
This balloon is consumed in the casting.
