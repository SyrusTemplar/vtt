This spell damages wooden constructions just as a fireball does. It inflicts
1d2 points of structural damage against stone or metal targets for every three
dice of damage it would normally inflict; round fractions down. For example, a <I>lightning bolt </I>from a 7th-level caster would inflict 3d2 points of damage against a mantlet
(a wooden target) and 2d2 points of damage against a portcullis (a metal
target). A <I>lightning bolt </I>can set wooden constructions afire just as a fireball can.
