Ogres are big, ugly, greedy humanoids that live by ambushes, raids, and theft.
Ill-tempered and nasty, these monsters are often found serving as mercenaries
in the ranks of orc tribes, evil clerics, or gnolls. They mingle freely with
giants and trolls.
<P></P>
Adult ogres stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh 300 to 350 pounds. Their skin
colors range from a dead yellow to a dull black-brown, and (rarely) a sickly
violet. Their warty bumps are often of a different color -- or at least darker than
their hides. Their eyes are purple with white pupils. Teeth and talons are
orange or black. Ogres have long, greasy hair of blackish-blue to dull dark green.
Their odor is repellent, reminiscent of curdled milk. Dressing in poorly cured
furs and animal hides, they care for their weapons and armor only reasonably
well. It is common for ogres to speak orc, troll, stone giant, and gnoll, as
well as their own guttural language. A typical ogre's life span is 90 years.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">In small numbers, ogres fight as unorganized individuals, but groups of 11 or
more will have a leader, and groups of 16 or more usually include two leaders
and a chieftain. Ogres wielding weapons get a Strength bonus of +2 to hit;
leaders have +3, chieftains have +4. Females fight as males but score only 2-8
points of damage and have a maximum of only 6 hit points per die. Young ogres fight
as goblins.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Ogre tribes are found anywhere, from deep caverns to mountaintops. Tribes have
16-20 males, 2-12 females, and 2-8 young. Shamans, if present, will be of 3rd
level, and have access to the spheres of combat, divination, healing,
protection, and sun (darkness only). Ogres live by raiding and scavenging and they will
eat anything. Their fondness for elf, dwarf, and halfling flesh means that
there is only a 10% chance that these will be found as slaves or prisoners. There
is a 30% chance that an ogre lair will include 2-8 slaves. Captured prisoners
are always kept as slaves (25%) or food (75%). Extremely avaricious, ogres
squabble over treasure and cannot be trusted, even by their own kind.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ogre Leader
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">When more than 11 ogres are encountered, a leader will be present. He is a 7
Hit Dice monster with 30-33 hit points and Armor Class 3. He inflicts 5-15
(2d6+3) points of damage per attack, +6 with weapon.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ogre Chieftain
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">If 16 or more ogres are encountered, they will be led by two patrol leaders
and a chieftain. The chieftain is a 7 Hit Dice monster with 34-37 hit points and
Armor Class 4. He inflicts 8-18 (2d6+6) points of damage per attack, +6 with
weapon. Chieftains are usually the biggest and smartest ogres in their tribes.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Ogres consistently plague mankind, lusting for gold, gems, and jewelry as well
as human flesh. They are evil-natured creatures that join with other monsters
to prey on the weak and favor overwhelming odds to a fair fight. Ogres make no
crafts nor labor.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ogre Mage
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The oriental ogre has light blue, light green, or pale brown skin with ivory
horns. The hair is usually a different color (blue with green, green with blue)
and is darker in shade; the main exception to this coloration is found in ogre
magi with pale brown skin and yellow hair. They have black nails and dark eyes
with white pupils. The teeth and tusks are very white. Ogre magi are taller and
more intelligent than their cousins and they dress in oriental clothing and
armor.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Ogre magi can perform the following feats of magic: <I>fly</I> (for 12 turns), become <I>invisible,</I> cause <I>darkness</I> in a 10-foot radius, <I>polymorph</I> to a human or similar bipedal creature (4 feet to 12 feet tall), and <I>regenerate</I> one hit point per round (lost members must be reattached to regenerate). Once
per day they can do the following: <I>charm person, sleep,</I> assume <I>gaseous form,</I> and create a <I>cone of cold</I> 60 feet long with a terminal diameter of 20 feet, which inflicts 8-64 (8d8)
points of damage (save vs. spell for half damage). Oriental ogres attack with
magic first and resort to physical attacks only if necessary. They are +1 on
morale.
<P></P>
In battle, ogre magi prefer the naganata (75%) or scimitar and whip (25%).
Those found in oriental settings might (25%) possess ki power or have mastered a
martial arts form. As ogre magi are intelligent, they will not fight if faced
with overwhelming odds, but will flee to gather their forces or hide.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">These monsters live in fortified dwellings or caves and foray to capture
slaves, treasure, and food. Ogre magi priests of up to 7th level have been reported.
Tribes are small, with 2-5 females and 1-3 children that will not fight, but
rather seek to escape in <I>gaseous form.</I> These monsters are extremely protective of their young and will battle with
savage abandon to save one's life. If a young ogre mage is captured, these
creatures will pay high ransom for its return, but they will seek revenge and will
never forget the insult of the kidnaping.
<P></P>
If encountered in their lair, ogre magi will be led by a chief of great
strength (+2 on each Hit Die, attacking and saving as a 9 Hit Dice monster). Treasure
is divided by this chief and his trove is always the richest. The tribe will
have their own clan symbol typical to the oriental lands, and this symbol will
be stitched on its war banners and flags as well as on armor and headdresses.
The chief will often have the tribe's symbol tattooed on his forehead or back.
<P></P>
Ogre magi speak the common tongue, their own special language, and the speech
of normal ogres.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Ogre magi magical armor is too large to fit a man. This monster's lair is
usually a powerful structure that can be expanded into a mighty fortress if it can
be rid of its original owners.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Merrow (Aquatic Ogre)
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Faster and fiercer than their land kin, the freshwater merrow are greenish and
scaled with webbed hands and feet. Their necks are long and thick, their
shoulders are sloping, and they have huge mouths and undershot jaws. Merrow have
black teeth and nails and deep green eyes with white centers, and their hair
resembles slimy seaweed. About 10% grow ivory horns, especially the more powerful
males.
<P></P>
Aquatic ogres are very fond of tattoos, and females may have their entire
bodies inked with scenes of death and destruction as a sign of status. Merrow speak
their own dialect and the language of other ogres.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Using their green coloration, aquatic ogres can hide, becoming effectively
invisible 10-80% of the time, depending on terrain. They attack from cover, so
others are -5 on their surprise roll. Merrow typically attack with a large
piercing spear (inflicting 2-12 points of damage) in a swimming charge at +1 to hit,
followed by melee with talons and teeth.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A typical merrow tribe consists of:
<P></P>
<P></P>
1 chief, AC3, 6+6 Hit Dice, +2 on damage
<P></P>
2 patrol leaders, AC3, 5+5 Hit Dice, +1 on damage
<P></P>
2-24 standard merrow
<P></P>
2-24 females, AC5, 3+3 Hit Dice, 1-2/1-2/1-6 damage
<P></P>
1-12 young, AC6, 2+2 Hit Dice, 1-2/1-2/1-4 damage
<P></P>
1 shaman of 3rd level ability
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
Merrow dwell in caves in shallow, fresh water (50-250 feet deep), often with
scrags (see <A HREF="DD04079.htm#7b8baad4"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD04079.htm#7b8baad4">Troll</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> ). They can live out of water for about two hours, so they often forage on
land. Merrow usually control an area with a radius of 10-15 miles, hunting and
foraging throughout this territory. In times of scarcity, or when the lure of
treasure becomes too great, a war party will attack the coastal villages of man.
Merrow prefer gold and jewels and often overlook dull magical items in search of
glittering prizes. The goals of a merrow chieftain rule the tribe, and these
power-hungry monsters seek to completely control their &quot;kingdoms,&quot; often leading
to attacks on intruding ships.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Merrow are ignorant and superstitious and have no skills but plundering and
murder. Areas of the freshwater lakes and seas where they have influence are
avoided by sailors and fishermen. These monsters are carnivores, preying on all who
enter their regions, often emptying the seas of life with their voracious
appetites.
