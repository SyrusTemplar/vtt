Mages are more versatile than specialist wizards, who are limited to casting
spells from certain schools. Mages can cast spells from any school of magic.
Examples of mages from legend and literature are: Merlin, Gandalf, Medea, and
Circe.
<P></P>
Wizards have 40 character points to spend on skills from the following list.
These abilities range from 5 to 15 character points. Any unspent points can be
used to acquire nonweapon proficiencies or saved for use during the game.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Access to schools:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> It costs 5 points per school to which the wizard has access. For example, if
a wizard wanted to have access to six schools, the cost would be 30 character
points. Normally, wizards spend 40 points to cast spells from the eight standard
schools: abjuration, alteration, conjuration/summoning, enchantment/ charm,
divination, illusion/phantasm, invocation/evocation, and necromancy. Note that
the spells that make up the optional schools of alchemy, geometry, and elemental
magic (from the <I>Tome of Magic</I>) are generally included in the standard schools of magic.
