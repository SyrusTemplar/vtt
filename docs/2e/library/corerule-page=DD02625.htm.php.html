Some kits may allow characters to use barred weapons; for example, militant
wizards may select a sword as one of their weapon proficiencies. Generally, the
bonuses and perks of a kit are considered to negate any out-of-class penalties.
However, priests may still be limited by their priesthood weapon restrictions.
