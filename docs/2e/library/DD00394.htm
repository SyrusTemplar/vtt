Sometimes the attacker's to-hit number seems impossible to roll. An attack
might be so difficult it requires a roll greater than 20 (on a 20-sided die), or
so ridiculously easy it can be made on a roll less than 1. In both cases, an
attack roll is still required.
<P></P>
The reason is simple: With positive die roll modifiers (for magic, Strength,
situation, or whatever), a number greater than 20 can be rolled. Likewise, die
roll penalties can push the attack roll below 0.
<P></P>
No matter what number a character needs to hit, a roll of 20 is always
considered a hit and a roll of 1 is always a miss--unless the DM rules otherwise.
Under most circumstances, a natural 20 hits and a natural 1 misses, regardless of
any modifiers applied to the die roll.
<P></P>
Thus, even if a character's chance to hit a monster is 23 and the character
has a -3 penalty applied to the die roll, he might
<P></P>
be able to score a hit--but only if the die roll is a 20 before any modifiers
are applied. Likewise, a character able to hit a monster on a 3 or better,
waving a<I> sword +4</I>, could still miss if a 1 is rolled on the die.
<P></P>
There are no sure things, good or bad, in the unpredictable chaos of combat
situations.
