</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><B>Death Ward</B> (Abjuration, Necromancy)
<P></P>
<P></P>
Range: 0
<P></P>
Components: V, S, M
<P></P>
Duration: Special
<P></P>
Casting Time: 1 turn
<P></P>
Area of Effect: One doorway, portal, or small object
<P></P>
Saving Throw: Neg.
<P></P>
<P></P>
By covering a doorway with the most forbidden and lethal of necromantic runes,
a wizard can protect a small portal so that any creature that tries to pass
through the warded area without first speaking a word of command is immediately
subjected to a modified <I>death spell</I>. A <I>death ward</I> may also be cast on an item (usually a spell book or phylactery) or on a
tunnel or cave entrance no larger than 30’ feet in diameter. A single application
of this spell can kill up to twice as many hit dice or levels of creatures as
the wizard who cast the spell has levels of experience (thus a 20th-level wizard
can slay up to 40 levels with a single<I> death ward</I>).
<P></P>
Each creature passing through the ward is entitled to a saving throw vs. death
magic with a –4 penalty; if successful, the individual survives and the ward
loses none of its lethality. However, those who fail their saves are immediately
slain (as per a <I>death spell</I>) and their levels or hit dice are subtracted from the potency of the ward.
Those with greater hit dice than the current power of the <I>death ward</I> are unaffected by the spell.
<P></P>
For example, an 18th-level lich has cast the <I>death ward</I> (which can slay up to 36 levels) on the entrance to her inner sanctum. A
party of four characters, each 15th level, enter her lair and foolishly traverse
the warding. The first member fails his save and perishes, reducing the ward’s
effectiveness to 21 levels. The second character makes her save and thus escapes
any ill effects (the ward remains unaffected, however). The third character
fails the save and dies also, reducing the ward to 6 levels of potency. The fourth
15th-level character has too many levels of experience to be affected by the
weakened ward, which remains in effect until drained by a less powerful being.
<P></P>
Despite its lethality, this is not a subtle warding. The protected area or
object is literally covered with intricate, arcane runes and symbols at the time
of casting These glyphs may flash ominously with pale red or blue light when
approached within 10 feet. The entire area radiates a magical aura of lethal
necromancy. Provided that he or she is on the same plane of existence, the caster
will be immediately aware if the <I>death ward</I> has been triggered. By concentrating, the wizard who cast the ward may
determine its current level of lethality, regardless of distance.
<P></P>
This terrible spell is a closely held secret, guarded jealously by the most
powerful and black-hearted of necromancers and liches. It was originally designed
by liches, as they can easily sustain the rigors of casting such a spell.
<P></P>
Mortal wizards who employ this powerful spell have a 25% chance of going
insane (as per the<I> contact other plane</I> spell), contracting permanent paralysis (via a stroke), or suffering from a
terminal illness (as per the <I>cause disease</I> spell) as adjudicated by the DM. The danger of misfortune is reduced by 5%
for every point by which the mortal wizard’s Intelligence is above 18, though
this modified chance never drops below 5%. Curiously, the mental stability
afforded by lichdom makes these undying wizards completely immune to the dangers of
employing this ward. It is similarly rumored that certain ancient, evil dragons
have developed an even more potent version of this spell, which they may employ
in their lairs with impunity.
<P></P>
The material component is a magical ink fabricated exclusively for this spell.
The list of the ink’s noxious ingredients is lengthy and complex, but it
includes the venom of numerous poisonous animals and the acrid ichor of extraplanar
fiends. Not surprisingly, the accumulation of these deadly components and the
subsequent fabrication of the baneful ink itself sometimes results in tragedy
for a mortal wizard, as mentioned previously.
<P></P>
While the inscription process (the actual casting) of the <I>death ward</I> takes only 1 turn, the fabrication process of the ink (once the proper
ingredients have been assembled) takes 1–4 days. The ink also requires the dust of
powdered perdiots and garnets, worth between 2,000–8,000 gp.
