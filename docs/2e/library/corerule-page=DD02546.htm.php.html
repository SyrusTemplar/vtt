</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Swamps are like marshes, but have trees and thickets. Most of a swamp’s trees
can be found on islands of solid ground, but many others (such as cypresses)
can thrive in the water. The Louisiana bayou, the Great Dismal Swamp of Virginia,
and portions of the Everglades are good examples of swamps.
