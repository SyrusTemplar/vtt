Spell Research </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">At some point, almost any player character spellcaster is going to want to try
his hand at spell research. Devising a new spell is a great way for a
character to make a lasting mark on a campaign, as noted above, but it-s also a fun
exercise for the player and the DM; a new spell customizes and alters the campaign
and the game itself.
<P></P>
While both wizards and priests can research new spells, it-s much more common
for wizards to do so. The philosophy of experimentation and investigation seems
much more appropriate for wizards, since priests are inclined (quite
naturally) to take things on faith and stick to the proven powers and abilities of their
patron deity. However, there-s no reason why a PC priest couldn-t participate
in as much research as he or she wishes to; this is only a generalization, not
a rule.
<P></P>
There are two parts of spell research: designing the spell, and actually
executing the spell research in game play. The player and DM will have to take time
to work out the details of the spell before the character can embark on his
research.
