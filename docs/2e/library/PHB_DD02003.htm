By means of this spell, the caster can contact a single creature with whom he
is familiar and whose name and appearance are known. If the creature in
question is not on the same plane of existence as the spellcaster, there is a base 5%
chance that the sending does not arrive. Local conditions on other planes may
worsen this chance considerably, at the option of the DM. The sending, if
successful, can be understood even by a creature with an Intelligence as low as 1
(animal intelligence).
<P></P>
The wizard can send a short message of 25 words or less to the recipient; the
recipient can answer in like manner immediately. Even if the sending is
received, the subject creature is not obligated to act upon it in any manner.
<P></P>
The material component for this spell consists of two tiny cylinders, each
with one open end, connected by a short piece of fine copper wire.
