This is a sort of non-attack maneuver.
<P></P>
The Hold Attack maneuver is a way for a character to delay making his attack
until later in the combat round. It's usually performed when the character is
hoping that battle circumstances will change so that he can get a shot in
somewhere that is currently too well-defended. Archers use this maneuver a lot, so
that they can snipe more effectively.
<P></P>
To perform the Hold Maneuver, the character, when it's time for him to
announce his intention, says &quot;I'm holding my maneuver.&quot; Combat proceeds to the next
character.
<P></P>
Then, once everyone has gone in the round, as secondary attacks are being
determined, the DM again asks the character what he's going to do; he can take his
action then. If he does not, he forfeits that attack.
