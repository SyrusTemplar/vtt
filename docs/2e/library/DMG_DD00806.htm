<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ring of Swimming:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The <I>ring of swimming</I> bestows upon the wearer the ability to swim at a full 21 base speed. (This
assumes, of course, that the wearer is clad in garments appropriate for such
activity.) The ring further enables the wearer to dive up to 50 feet into water
without injury, providing the depth of the water is at least 1? feet per 10 feet
of diving elevation. The wearer can stay underwater for up to four rounds
without needing a breath of air. Surface swimming can continue for four hours before
a one hour (floating) rest is needed. The ring confers the ability to stay
afloat under all but typhoon-like conditions.
