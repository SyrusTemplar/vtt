AD&amp;D game bards are loosely derived from Celtic poets who sang their tribes?
histories. Examples include the Pied Piper of Hamelin, Alan-a-Dale, Will
Scarlet, and Homer. A bard should be glib of tongue, light of heart, and fleet of foot.
<P></P>
A bard is a jack-of-all-trades, but a master of none. He fights as rogue, but
he can use any weapon. A bard can wear any armor up to, and including, chain
mail, but he cannot use a shield.
<P></P>
All bards are skilled singers, vocalists, and musicians. A bard character
automatically begins play with the proficiencies of Singing and Musical Instrument,
in the instrument of the player-s choice. The character does not have to
expend character points for these bonus proficiencies, but he may choose to use CPs
to increase his level of skill by raising his proficiency scores or acquiring
the appropriate traits (see <A HREF="DD03006.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03006.htm">Chapter Six</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">).
<P></P>
<P></P>
Bards have 70 character points to spend on skills from the following list.
Skills costs 5 to 15 points. Any unspent points can be used to acquire nonweapon
proficiencies or saved for use during the game. Many of the skills can be
improved as bards advance levels. This is explained after the skill section.
<P></P>
<P></P>
Skills marked with an asterisk (*) can be improved as a bard advances in level.

<A NAME="9105d011"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Alter moods (5):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> When performing before a non-hostile group, the bard can alter the group-s
mood. This can be achieved via an inspiring poem, a tragic tale, a collection of
jokes, or a lively tune. Everyone hearing the bard-s performance must make a
saving throw vs. paralyzation. For every three experience levels the bard
possesses apply a ?1 modifier to each roll. If the save fails, the group-s current
attitude can be shifted one level in the direction chosen by the bard. See the
reactions section of the <A HREF="DMG_DD00563.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="DMG_DD00563.htm">Dungeon Master Guide</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> for more details.

<A NAME="7c5d2bf3"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Animal friendship (10):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Once a day, the bard can cast the equivalent of an <I>animal friendship</I> spell by singing a soothing song.
<P></P>
<A NAME="6c88dd2f"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Charm resistance (5): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Bards with this ability gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws versus charm-like
spells and effects.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Climb walls* (5):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This skill lets bards climb smooth or vertical surfaces.
<P></P>
<A NAME="0e666c45"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Counter effects (10):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Bards are able to counter the effects of songs and music used as magical
attacks by performing a counter song. All characters within 30' of the bard are
immune to such attacks. For example, the bard-s adventuring party would be immune
to the effects of a harpy-s song. The bard can perform no actions other than a
slow walk while countering magic with his music. If he is struck in combat or
fails any saving throw, the effect of his counter song ends. More details of
this power can be found in the <A HREF="PHB_DD01485.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="PHB_DD01485.htm">Player's Handbook</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I>.
<P></P>
</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Detect magic* (10):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Bards can spot magical radiations within their line of sight, up to 60 feet
away. They can determine the intensity of the magic-dim, faint, moderate,
strong, and overwhelming.
<P></P>
<A NAME="8e73bb8e"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Detect noise* (5):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This is the ability to hear sounds others usually can-t.
<P></P>
<A NAME="ed55bb26"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>History (10):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> In his travels, a bard learns a great many things. The bard can read and
write his native language and knows his area-s local history. In addition, a bard
has a 5% chance per level to identify the general purpose, function, and history
of any magical item he comes across. The bard need not touch the item, but he
must examine it closely.
<P></P>
<A NAME="3687dd59"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Pick pockets* (10):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A bard uses this skill to pilfer small items from the pouches, pockets,
belts, sleeves, packs, etc. of others. A failed attempt means the bard did not come
away with an item, but it does not indicate the bard was caught in the act. To
determine if a bard-s attempt was noticed, subtract three times the victim-s
experience level from 100. If the bard-s roll was equal to or higher than this
number, the attempt was noticed. For example, if the thief tried to pick the
pocket of a 7th level wizard and failed-and the thief-s roll was 79 or higher-the
thief is noticed. (7x3 = 21. 100?21 = 79.)
<P></P>
<A NAME="d623ff08"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Rally friends (5):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> The bard can inspire his compatriots who are about to enter battle. If the
bard knows the nature of the threat they face, the bard can spend three full
rounds rallying his friends with one of the following effects: a +1 bonus on attack
rolls, a +1 bonus to saving throws, or a +2 bonus on Morale rolls during the
upcoming battle. The range is 10' per level of the bard, and the duration is one
round per level of the bard.
<P></P>
<A NAME="f0fd29ea"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Read languages* (5):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A bard needs every edge he can get, and the ability to read languages could
put him ahead of his competitors.
<P></P>
<A NAME="ea1a3503"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sound resistance (5):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Bards gain a +2 bonus to saving throws vs. sound-based magical attacks such
as: harpy-s song, dragonne-s roar, sphinx-s roar, the shout spell, yeth hound
howl, and sirine song.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Scroll use (5/10):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> At 10th level, any bard can use magical spell scrolls. By purchasing this
skill as a 10-point ability, he has a chance to read scrolls at any level. If a
bard fails to accurately read the scroll, usually something detrimental occurs,
such as the spell backfiring. Consult <A HREF="DD02947.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02947.htm">Table 31</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> for the bard-s chance to read a scroll.
<P></P>
<A NAME="2a5737d6"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon specialization (10):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> This bard can specialize in a particular weapon. The character point cost
must be met in addition.
<P></P>
<A NAME="65435205"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wizard spells (10):</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Bards are dabblers in magic, studying it in a rather disorganized fashion.
They cannot specialize in a school of magic. They can cast spells once they reach
2nd level, and they begin with one to four spells in their spell books. A
bard-s spell-casting level is equal to his actual experience level. The bard-s
spell progression chart follows.
<P></P>
After a bard-s skills are selected, consult the <A HREF="DD02947.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02947.htm">table</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> below to determine base scores. If the bard has skills from the table, record
the appropriate scores. These skills can improve as the bard gains levels.
<P></P>
<A NAME="6a46b37f"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Skill points:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Next, allocate 20 discretionary points among the bard-s -scored? skills. If
the bard possesses only one of those skills, all 20 points are allotted to it.
If the bard did not select any of those skills, the 20 points can be spent on
nonweapon proficiencies or saved for use during the game.
<P></P>
Each time a bard advances a level, he is awarded 15 discretionary points to
divide among those abilities.
