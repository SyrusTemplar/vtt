muscular frames. They have light yellow to light brown hides, with thick coarse
hair and bestial eyes. Their ears are large and prominent, and their mouths are
full of sharp fangs. Bugbears are true carnivores, with keen sight and hearing,
and they can move with amazing stealth when they try.

Most bugbears live by plundering and ambush, taking slaves and eating anything
they kill. A player character bugbear is an extremely unusual representative
of his species who must struggle to control a vicious temperament and natural
inclination to bully those weaker than himself. Even the most honorable bugbears
can be fatally misled by avariciousness and hunger for power.
