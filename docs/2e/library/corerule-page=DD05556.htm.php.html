<P></P>
This god is a patron of the hunter, and is a provider of foods and furs; thus
he is a god much loved of woodsmen. Though he hunts animals and encourages his
flock to do likewise, he is usually a wise hunter; like the god of Animals, he
is often a patron of animals and their protector from needless destruction at
the hands of too-greedy hunters and poachers.
<P></P>
The god's priests, too, are hunters, and their mission is to teach the flock
sound principles of hunting: Not killing mothers with young, not depopulating
the wilderness of whole species, etc.
<P></P>
An alternate aspect of the god would be a god of Fishing.
<P></P>
The god of hunting is as likely to be male as female.
<P></P>
The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Animals,
Darkness/Night, Light, Moon, and Sun.

<P></P>
<B>Followers and Strongholds:</B> The followers are received at 9th level, and consist of one third-level
priest and two first-level priests of the same priesthood, plus one fifth-level
ranger, three third-level rangers, and six first-level rangers to act as &quot;forest
rangers,&quot; and ten Normal Men and Women, all of whom have the Veterinarian
nonweapon proficiency. (This proficiency doesn't appear in the<I> Player's Handbook</I>. It is identical to the Healing proficiency, except it can only be used to
heal animals and monsters.) The priest may take the following on adventures: One
priest and two rangers of his choice. The priesthood will pay for half of the
cost of stronghold construction at 9th level. The stronghold can be built in a
city or in the wilderness, but must work principally to protect the animal-life
of the surrounding wilderness. (This does not mean to stop hunters if the
hunting is carried out at a level that does not threaten the animal population. But
any factor which does endanger animal species -- such as drought, excess
hunting, deforestation, etc. -- will bring on the wrath of the priesthood.)
<P></P>
<B>Possible Symbols:</B> Bow and arrow crossed.
<P></P>
<B>Notes:</B> The harpoon and trident may only be used by priests whose god includes
attributes of the sea or fishing. If the god is devoted to land-hunting, the priests
cannot use the harpoon or trident.
