<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Humanoid
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Humanoid creatures have two arms, two legs, and a head. The creature walks
upright and generally uses tools and weapons. In most respects, the creature
functions just like a player character, and is subject to all forms or critical hits
and their special effects.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Human
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The creature is Man-sized or smaller: humans, dwarves, elves, orcs, kobolds,
hobgoblins, and thri-kreen are examples of human type creatures.
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits: </B>Use the humanoid charts. If the creature has multiple arms or legs, the limbs
actually involved in the combat or closest to the attack are the most likely to
be struck. Roll 1d6; a roll of 1–5 indicates that the active limb is struck,
and a roll of 6 indicates the inactive limb is struck. If the creature is
employing all its limbs, there is an equal chance for any limb to be struck. For
example, an unarmed thri-kreen is fighting with all four claws and its opponent
rolls a left arm critical. The two arms on the thri-kreen’s left side are equally
likely to be hit (roll 1d6 to determine which one). However, if the thri-kreen
was using a weapon in one right hand, a shield in one left hand, and holding
equipment in its remaining two hands, a left arm critical would most likely
strike the shield arm.
<P></P>
<B>Combat: </B>Human types use attack options, battle tactics, and combat options as their
intelligence ratings allow.

The creature is larger than Man-sized, but not Huge: ogres, gnolls, bugbears,
minotaurs, and quaggoths are examples of ogre type creatures.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Combat: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Ogre types use attack options, battle tactics, and combat options as their
intelligence ratings allow. They often employ tactics that exploit their superior
size and reach, such as moving back out of melee range to force an opponent to
close again while the creature guards.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Giant
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The creature is Huge or larger: the various races of giants, giant-kin,
titans, and some genies are examples of giant type creatures.
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B> </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Use the humanoid charts, but most opponents are forced to attack low (see <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02717.htm.php.html#bcdf214c"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02717.htm.php.html#bcdf214c">Chapter Six</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">).
<P></P>
<B>Combat:</B> Most giant types are fond of overrunning opponents, especially if they are
two or more size classes larger (see <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02422.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02422.htm.php.html">Chapter One</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">); a giant is likely to create a great deal of havoc when overrunning an
entire formation of dwarves. Overrunning can be a dangerous tactic, however, and
intelligent or experienced giants usually only try it early in a battle, when they
have enough hit points to withstand the attacks of opportunity they are likely
to provoke.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Humanoid Flyer
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The creature can be any size, but has wings sprouting from its back: pixies,
harpies, gargoyles, and pit fiends are examples of humanoid flyer type creatures.
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits: </B>Use the humanoid charts. Arm hits can strike the wings instead; for frontal
attacks roll 1d6; 1–4 means an arm hit, 5–6 a wing hit). Reverse the odds for
rear attacks. Arm hits from flank attacks have equal chances of hitting an arm or
a wing.
<P></P>
<B>Combat: </B>A flyer’s tactics usually emphasize mobility. If the creature has a ranged
attack, it stays out of reach and attacks from a distance. In melee, the creature
tends to swoop down for flank or rear attacks, then flies out of reach (using
the withdraw option at half its flying speed).

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Troll/Ape
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The creature can be any size, but relies on natural weaponry: trolls,
gorillas, and umber hulks are examples of troll/ape type creatures.
<P></P>
<B>Critical Hits: </B>Use the humanoid charts; however, a troll/ape’s long arms can be used for
locomotion if necessary. Reduce movement penalties from leg hits by one step: a
no-move result limits the creature to a 1/2 move, a 1/2-move effect reduces the
creature to a 3/4 move, and a 1/4 effect is ignored. Trolls and other creatures
that regenerate ignore grazes. Points regenerated count as magical healing for
reducing bleeding effects. For example, a troll suffers major bleeding for only
two rounds before it is reduced to minor bleeding (because it regenerates 6 hit
points in that time). After two more rounds, the minor bleeding stops.
<P></P>
<B>Combat: </B>These creatures are fond of overruns (if their size allows) and wrestling
attacks (they can bite while wrestling). Their powerful claws are treated as
weapons one size larger than normal (<A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02832.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02832.htm.php.html">see below</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">).
