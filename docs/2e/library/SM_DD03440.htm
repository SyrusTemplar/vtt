Paladins gain the ability to cast priest spells from the spheres of combat,
divination, healing, and protection at 9th level. Unlike true priest characters,
paladins do not gain extra spells for high Wisdom scores and may not use
clerical magical items. At 9th level, the paladin-s effective casting level is only
1st level; for each experience level past 9th, the paladin-s casting level
increases by one, to a maximum of 9th level for a 17th-level paladin. (See <A HREF="PHB_DD01465.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01465.htm">Table 17</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Paladin Spell Progression in the <I>PHB</I>.)
<P></P>
Since paladins only use priest spells, they may use armor with no restrictions
while casting spells. However, the character should have at least one hand
free to present his holy symbol or any other material components required, so a
character might have to drop a shield or second weapon in order to cast a spell.

Optional Spell Abilities for Paladins</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">
<P></P>
The paladin-s spell powers can be customized, just like those of any other
class. Some of the options available include the following:
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Alternate Sphere Access (5+): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Refer to <A HREF="DD03430.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03430.htm">Table 6</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Access Costs in the previous chapter. Standard paladins have the equivalent
of minor access to the spheres of combat, divination, healing, and protection,
totalling 20 CPs. A paladin may choose to have minor access to any combination
of alternate spheres totalling 20 CPs or less. For example, the paladin of a
sea god might choose all, elemental water, healing, weather, and creation. Note
that the paladin only pays for minor access, but still gains the ability to
cast 4th-level spells. The paladin may exchange spheres for 5 CPs or buy
additional spheres at the cost listed in <A HREF="DD03430.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03430.htm">Table 6</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> .
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Increased spell power (7): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A paladin with this power casts spells with an effective casting level only
four levels less than his true level and has no maximum casting level. Normally,
a 9th-level paladin casts spells as a 1st-level priest, but with this ability
the 9th-level paladin casts spells with the power of a 5th-level priest. Spell
progression is unaffected; only level-based characteristics of an individual
spell are affected by this ability.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Increased spell progression (10/15): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">A paladin with this power gains his spell ability earlier than 9th level. For
10 points, he begins to gain spells at 7th level; for 15 points, he begins to
gain spells at 4th level. In all other respects, his spell powers are unchanged,
and he simply enters <A HREF="PHB_DD01465.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="PHB_DD01465.htm">Table 17</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> in the <I>PHB </I>at the level indicated. Each level he gains from that point on advances him
one level on the chart, so a 7th-level paladin with this ability uses the
9th-level entry and goes on to the 10th-level entry when he rises to 8th level.

Optional Spell Limitations for Paladins
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Since the scope of this book is simply to discuss magical powers, the paladin
class-design options have not been included in their entirety. Players
interested in creating customized paladin characters should refer to the <I>Player-s Option: <A HREF="SP_DD02934.htm"></A></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="SP_DD02934.htm">Skills &amp; Powers</A></I></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>book. The abilities above simply add to the slate of available powers for
paladin characters.
<P></P>
If you wish to use these special advantages without the <I>Skills &amp; Powers </I>rules, you can simply assign the paladin an experience point penalty of 30%
plus 1% per point spent. If a paladin chooses increased spell progression and
increased spell power, his total penalty would be 30% + 10% + 7%, or 47%; if the
DM awards 3,000 experience points for an adventure, the paladin would gain 1,410
less than normal, only collecting 1,590 experience points. This slower
advancement counters the character-s unusual advantages.
