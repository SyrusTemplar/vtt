Each demihuman race has its own culture and crafts, and these may be
quantified by nonweapon proficiencies. Below is listed each nonhuman AD&amp;D? character
race, along with the nonweapon proficiencies that are most highly recommended
because they reflect the demihumans' heritage.
<P></P>
Note that these proficiencies are merely recommended, for the sake of
characterization. Players are not required to choose from these lists for their
demihuman thieves; nor do they receive any as bonus nonweapon proficiencies. If a
proficiency is not recommended for the demihuman thief's kit or class, it costs
another proficiency slot, just as it would for any other character.
<P></P>
<I>Optional Rule:</I> A demihuman using a recommended proficiency may get a bonus of +1 on any
proficiency check he may be required to roll.
<P></P>
Nonweapon proficiency recommendations are listed by category (General, Thief,
etc.).

Because of their mixed heritage, half-elves may have the full diversity of
their human parent, or they may be inclined to take proficiencies like those of
other elves (above). It probably depends on who raised the half-elf thief and
where. If the optional demi-human proficiency bonus for recommended proficiencies
is used, half-elves should receive it when they use the elven-recommended
proficiencies listed above, regardless of where they were raised.
