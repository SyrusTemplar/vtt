<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Missile weapons are intended mainly as long-range weapons. Ideally, they are
used before the opponents reach your line. However, ideal situations are all too
rare, and characters often discover that the only effective way to attack is
to shoot arrows (or whatever) at an enemy already in melee combat with their
companions. While possible, and certainly allowed, this is a risky proposition.
<P></P>
When missiles are fired into a melee, the DM counts the number of figures in
the immediate area of the intended target. Each Medium figure counts as 1. Small
(S) figures count as ?, Large as 2, Huge as 4, and Gargantuan as 6. The total
value is compared to the value of each character or creature in the target
melee. Using this ratio, the DM rolls a die to determine who (or what) will be the
target of the shot.

<I> Tarus Bloodheart (man-size, or 1 point) and Rath (also man-size, or 1 point)
are fighting a giant (size G, 6 points) while Thule fires a long bow at the
giant. The total value of all possible targets is 8 (6+1+1). There's a 1 in 8
chance that Rath is the target; a 1 in 8 chance that Tarus is hit; and a 6 in 8
chance the shot hits the giant. The DM could roll an 8-sided die to determine who
gets hit, or he could reduce the ratios to a percentage (75% chance the giant is
hit, etc.) and roll percentile dice.
