By means of a <I>withdraw</I> spell, the priest in effect alters the flow of time with regard to himself.
While but one round of time passes for those not affected by the spell, the
priest is able to spend two rounds, plus one round per level, in contemplation.
Thus, a 5th-level priest can withdraw for seven rounds to cogitate on some matter
while one round passes for all others. (The DM should allow the player one
minute of real time per round withdrawn to ponder some problem or question. No
discussion with other players is permitted.) Note that while affected by the <I>withdraw</I> spell, the caster can use only the following spells: any divination spell or
any curing or healing spell, the latter on himself only. The casting of any of
these spells in different fashion (for example, a <I>cure light wounds</I> spell bestowed upon a companion) negates the <I>withdraw</I> spell. Similarly, the withdrawn caster cannot walk or run, become invisible,
or engage in actions other than thinking, reading, and the like. He can be
affected by the actions of others, losing any Dexterity or shield bonus. Any
successful attack upon the caster breaks the spell.
