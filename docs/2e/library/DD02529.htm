This is related to encounter range, since terrain types that limit visibility
also restrict missile fire. A battlefield?s lines of fire are described as <I>clear, impaired</I>, or <I>severely impaired</I>. Clear lines of fire are easy: the battlefield has no effects on missile fire.
<P></P>
Impaired lines of fire have no effect on missile fire within the terrain?s
minimum encounter distance; for example, light forest has an encounter range of
4d6 squares, so the first 4 squares of any missile fire are unaffected. After
this minimum distance, targets are treated as if they had one step of hard cover
more than they actually do; a target in the open actually has 25% cover, 25%
covered targets are bumped up to 50%, and so on. This is because low branches or
trees are obscuring the line of fire.
<P></P>
Severely impaired lines of fire have no effect on fire within the terrain?s
minimum encounter range, similar to impaired lines of fire, above. In severely
impaired lines of fire, the maximum range of any missile fire is reduced to three
times the minimum encounter range, and all targets in this area gain two
levels of cover.
