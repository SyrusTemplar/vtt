<TITLE>Phobias-- Disadvantage (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
<script src="jscripts.js"></script><link rel="stylesheet" href="toc.css"></HEAD><BODY>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Phobias:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character who is consistently afraid of one particular thing (or category
of things) can have a real problem while adventuring. The phobia disadvantages
are worth varying degrees of character points, based on the frequency of
encountering that which the character fears, and whether the player chooses a
disadvantage that is moderate or severe.
<P></P>
The effects are generally the same. If the character is threatened by a
violent encounter with the object of the phobia, he must roll a Wisdom/Willpower
check (1/2 Wisdom/Willpower, if the phobia is severe). If successful, the character
can function normally, but if the check fails he must flee or otherwise seek
to avoid the encounter for 1–6 rounds. After this time, check again, and
continue to do so each 1–6 rounds until a check succeeds.
<P></P>
The DM can modify the Willpower checks for phobic characters. Someone who
hates enclosed places but is being pursued by a dragon, for example, might overcome
the phobia in favor of saving his life—perhaps gaining a +5 modifier to the
phobia check.
