Here, we'll look at the general pattern of relationships which can hold
between the thieves' guild and other social groups of importanceâ€”the law, merchants
and their fellows, other guilds, and the like. The important word is &quot;general.&quot;
The broad patterns outlined will be used later in the guild design section.
They are presented now for the DM to think about in advance.

The two most important relationships thieves' guilds have will be with the
people they steal most from (merchants) and the people doing their best to stop
them (the officers of the law). Several possible types of relationships are
outlined with each group. These are dominating themes only; checking the Complex/Mix
entry at the end of each group will suggest many variations on the dominant
themes.
