</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">One way to capture a castle or fortress is to climb the walls and overpower
the defenders inside. This sort of undertaking is very dangerous, but its
simplicity and speed makes it an obvious choice for small bands of heroes.
<P></P>
There are four basic types of castle walls in the AD&amp;D game:
<P></P>
<P></P>
<A NAME="f1f693dc"></A><B>Wooden Palisades: </B>These walls usually are made from sharpened logs about six inches thick. They
typically are 10 to 15 feet tall. Defenders cannot fight from atop a palisade
unless it is provided with a catwalk or hoardings (<A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02784.htm.php.html#935a4817"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02784.htm.php.html#935a4817">see below</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">).
<P></P>
<B>Stone: </B>These walls are made of a single layer of stone or brick and are otherwise
similar to palisades.
<P></P>
<A NAME="22a303f6"></A><B>Curtain Walls: </B>These walls are built of two layers of dressed stone with dirt and rubble
packed in between. Curtain walls generally are thick enough to provide a fighting
platform and are usually battlemented (<A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02784.htm.php.html#eea90be2"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02784.htm.php.html#eea90be2">see below</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">) to provide extra cover. Curtain walls are usually 30 to 60 feet high and can
be from 10 to 30 feet thick.
<P></P>
<A NAME="d82e46c9"></A><B>Earth ramparts: </B>These walls are mounds of dirt, usually carefully packed and braced. Unlike
the other three types of walls, which are vertical, a rampart slopes upward at a
steep angle. Defenders can fight from atop a rampart, but a stone wall,
palisade, or catwalk often is added at the top to provide extra cover. Ramparts are
usually 20 to 40 feet high and 40 to 80 feet thick.
