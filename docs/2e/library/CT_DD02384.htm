Combat rounds <I>replace</I> the one-minute round in normal AD&amp;D combat situations. If you need to keep
count, five combat rounds equal one normal round, and 50 equal a full turn.

To make things easy, the DM can rule that a battle, regardless of its actual
length, takes one turn. Characters tend to spend several minutes checking on
fallen enemies, surveying their own injuries, and making sure that the enemy has
abandoned the field before dropping their guard. Unless time is an issue, this
is reasonable.
