The mountain druid dwells in areas of rugged hills, alpine forests, and peaks
and rocks above the tree line. Members of this branch, such as Dansil
(illustrated on p. 19), wield over their environments a power gained from the element of
earth and especially from stone. They also draw power from the weather,
especially storms and clouds. Dansil and his fellows protect mountains and alpine
flora and fauna from those who would exploit them. This role frequently brings
them into conflict with miners, especially dwarves. Mountain druids often ally
themselves with storm and stone giants, which further angers dwarves.

<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Receives a +4 bonus to all saving throws vs. electrical attacks and to
mountaineering proficiency checks.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Gains a modifier of +3 to experience level when determining the effects of a
spell from the Elemental (earth or air) or Weather spheres cast while in the
mountains.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> For instance, say Dansil, a 5th-level mountain druid, cast the Weather spell <I>obscurement</I> while in his mountain environs. That spell, which has effects normally
lasting 20 rounds (four rounds per level), has an adjusted duration of 32 rounds, as
though Dansil were 8th level. Modify its normal area of effect of 50 feet - 50
feet (10 feet - 10 feet per level) to 80 feet - 80 feet.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Senses avalanches, volcanic eruptions, and rockfalls one turn before they
happen when the player rolls 1 to 5 on 1d6. This ability also enables the druid to
detect deadfall traps and falling blocks on a roll of 1 to 3 on 1d6.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Learns the languages of mountain-dwelling sentient creatures (such as dwarves,
red dragons, stone or storm giants, etc.), gaining one extra proficiency slot
for this purpose every three levels (at 3rd, 6th, etc.).

times per day at 7th level, exactly as <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01493.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01493.htm.php.html">described in the PH</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">. Each animal form (reptile, bird, or mammal, excluding giant forms) can be
used only once per day.
<P></P>
<B>Special Limitation:</B> None.
<P></P>
<B>Holy Symbol and Grove:</B> The mountain druid uses an eagle feather as a holy symbol. The grove of a
druid (such as Dansil) usually lies in the higher elevations, often a glade near a
beautiful waterfall on a slope or an ancient circle of standing stones on a
peak.
