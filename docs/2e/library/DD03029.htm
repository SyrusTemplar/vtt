<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Blacksmithing:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> A character with the blacksmithing proficiency can handle a forge, bellows,
hammer and tongs, to create tools and other objects out of iron. The character
cannot make weapons or armor, but can make?without a proficiency check?simple
items such as horseshoes, nails, brackets and buckles. By making a successful
proficiency check, the character can create intricate objects such as wire cages
and locks. A blacksmith can make an iron hoop for a wheel that has been made by
a carpenter; this combination of proficiencies is required for a strong wheel.
