Traditionally, the wizard’s laboratory is a wonderland of mysterious devices,
bubbling retorts, and strange powders, solvents, and reagents. Shelves crammed
full of arcane tomes, yellow scrolls encased in bone tubes, sheets of parchment
covered with cryptic notes and designs, candles made from suspicious
substances . . . all these things and more can be found in the wizard’s workshop. In
this chapter, we’ll take a look at some of the equipment and supplies required by
a working wizard.

In addition to the supplies and devices required for a laboratory and a
library, we’ll also examine various material spell components. Many powerful spells
may require unusual or hard to find items, and the DM can create obstacles and
restrictions—or more importantly, adventure opportunities— by requiring players
to keep track of spell materials. Lastly, this chapter discusses methods for
finding or buying spell components, reagents, and magical items.
