Rangers tend to be loners, uncomfortable in the company of &quot;civilized&quot; men.
They are also uncommon, again due to the demanding ability requirements of the
class. These two factors make armies or companies of rangers most unlikely, only
marginally less common than hordes of paladins.
<P></P>
Although loners, they do not mind the company of other rangers, those who
understand the ways of the wilderness and the need for space. Small groups of
rangers will sometimes join an army as its scouts, especially if the need is
pressing. They will occasionally be found in forest villages or near untracked
wildernesses. Here, guides, scouts, woodsmen, trappers, pioneers, and stalkers form
the pool from which the ranger ranks are filled. Few can be found in civilized
lands--rangers in cities are truly oddities.
