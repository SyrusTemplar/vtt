   In an AD&amp;D® campaign, virtually any type of relationship between church and
state is permitted. One kingdom may adhere to the feudal model. In another, the
church may claim exclusive sovereignty. It's important for all characters to
understand the balance of power in their world, but it's absolutely vital to the
paladin, as it affects his behavior, loyalty, and ethos.
<P></P>
   Following are three general types of church-state relationships. Each
describes the roles of religion and government; specifically, who makes and enforces
the laws of the land, and what role the paladin assumes in the official
hierarchy. The &quot;Fealty Notes&quot; section suggests answers to these questions:
<P></P>
• If a paladin comes from this type of society, to whom does he pledge fealty?
(Chapter 3 discusses the general responsibilities of fealty.)
<P></P>
• If the paladin has pledged fealty to both the church and state, whom does he
obey when religious and secular laws conflict?
<P></P>
   The DM has the final decision about which avenues of faith are open to the
paladin, as well as the relationship between the paladin's faith and his
government. Some, all, or none of these examples may work in a campaign; the DM may
develop other models equally valid and useful.

<P></P>
<P></P>
   A co-dominant society more or less follows the feudal model, where government
and religion share the burden of law enforcement and administrative duties. The
government handles matters pertaining to foreign affairs, economics, and
property rights, while the church regulates morality and social law. In all cases,
however, the monarchy and church leaders work closely together to protect their
mutual interests. Neither institutes a new policy without consulting the other.
Consequently, government and church laws rarely conflict.
<P></P>
   The government reinforces the authority of the church by declaring it the
official state religion. Other faiths may be tolerated, but not sanctioned; only
the state religion has the power to shape government policy. The monarchy seeks
the opinion of the church in all critical decisions, including diplomatic
appointments, declarations of war, and territorial annexations. A high-ranking priest
of the state church always serves as an official advisor, usually in the
capacity of Lord Chaplain, Curate, or High Patriarch.
<P></P>
   The church, in turn, reinforces the authority of the state by promoting the
concept of divine right. Essentially, this doctrine declares that monarches serve
at the pleasure of the gods; neither the approval nor consent of the citizenry
is required. Because the monarch in effect answers only to the gods, divine
right virtually guarantees the loyalty of his subjects.
<P></P>
   The church can remove a monarch at will, merely by rescinding divine approval.
Rescission may result from a major policy disagreement, immoral behavior, or
unlawful activities. Divine approval may also be withdrawn to punish an
arrogant, ailing, or uncooperative king. However, the church uses this power only as a
last resort. Because disruptions often trigger social unrest, even civil wars,
it is in the best interests of both the government and state church to
cooperate and maintain continuity.
<P></P>
   A paladin from a co-dominant society usually serves in the military branch of
either the government or church, depending on where he was trained and who most
needs his services. In the government military, he answers to a ranking
officer, usually a high-level warrior (who may be another paladin). In a church
military, he usually follows the orders of a high-level priest, or a higher-level
paladin entrusted with the prosecution of military affairs. In societies where
the church and government share a military, a paladin typically serves under a
high-level warrior, who in turn may answer to an administrative board containing
both government and church representatives.
<P></P>
   <B>Fealty notes:</B> A paladin who serves in a co-dominant society probably pledges fealty to both
government and church. Because religious and secular laws are compatible, he
should experience few problems with conflicting edicts. A church official will
never intentionally issue an edict that conflicts with government policy, nor
will a government official purposely give an order that violates church doctrine.
<P></P>
   If edicts inadvertently conflict, the paladin can usually avoid violating his
ethos if he obeys his church, even if he declines an order from his government.
For instance, if a government official orders a paladin to undertake a
military exercise on a day the church has set aside for meditation and prayer, the
paladin may decline the official's order without fear of retribution.
<P></P>
<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
   A secular society maintains a strict separation between church and state.
While religious practices may be tolerated, even encouraged, church officials have
no direct say in government policy. The church may serve as an informal advisor
to the government in matters pertaining to morality and behavior, but the
government is under no obligation to pass such recommendations into law. Because a
secular government doesn't need endorsement from the church, rulers don't
depend on divine right for authority. Secular governments range from
totalitarianism, where the state exerts total control over its people, to democracies, where
the people elect their representatives.
<P></P>
   Although the church may issue its own edicts, these edicts apply only the
followers of that particular faith. The church may punish its followers for
violating religions edicts, but only if the punishments don't interfere with the
rights guaranteed to all citizens under the laws of the state. A church, for
instance, may excommunicate a blasphemous follower, but it may not imprison or execute
him (unless the state has sanctioned such punishments).
<P></P>
   In some secular societies, the government refuses to recognize the church's
power of excommunication. If the gods want to excommunicate somebody, they do it
themselves instead of relying on human intermediaries. A man lives as moral a
life as he can; after he dies, the gods pass judgment on the fate of his spirit.
Membership in a church has little bearing on the gods' decision.
<P></P>
   A paladin serving a secular government likely works in a military or
diplomatic capacity, and adheres to a rigid command hierarchy. A high-ranking warrior or
paladin serves as his immediate commander. But as a good soldier and loyal
citizen, he is expected to follow the orders of all superior officers and
government officials.
<P></P>
<B>   Fealty notes:</B> A paladin from a secular society probably pledges fealty to his government.
He may also pledge fealty to a church if he likes. However, when government and
religious policies conflict, he is expected to follow the edicts of his
government, even if it means disobeying an edict from his church. (With two
exceptions—a direct command from a deity <I>always</I> overrides orders from a government; further, a paladin will never follow a
government edict that conflicts with his core principles—his principles always
take priority over social institutions.).
<P></P>
   If a paladin doesn't pledge fealty to a church, he <I>must </I>pledge fealty to a philosophy or force (see &quot;Alternatives to Churches&quot; below).
If a command from a teacher or mentor conflicts with government policy, he
must give priority to the edicts from his government. However, a direct command
from a deity always take precedence over government obligations.
<P></P>
<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
   In a theocratic society, the clergy assumes all leadership roles. In essence,
the church functions as the government, claiming absolute authority in all
civil, legal, and ethical matters. Laws come directly from the gods, interpreted
and regulated by the priesthood. To maintain order and ensure continuity, a
theocracy recognizes only the state religion. Other religions may be driven
underground at best, declared blasphemous and illegal at worst.
<P></P>
   As in a secular government, paladins serving a theocracy probably work as
soldiers, though some may function as ambassadors, diplomats, or evangelists. Most
theocratic hierarchies consider paladins to be lay brethren or acolytes, minor
religious dignitaries with formal responsibilities to the church but without
the status or authority of official clergymen.
<P></P>
   A paladin serving a theocracy always answers to a priest. A novice paladin may
be assigned a &quot;shepherd,'' a priest of 1st or 2nd level who constantly shadows
the paladin, monitoring his activities, and reporting any discrepancies to his
superiors. A <I>curate</I> (an administrator of at least 5th level in charge of several congregations in
a small town or city district) oversees low-level paladins, whereas a <I>primate</I> (a priest of at least 10th level, responsible for a city or section of a
kingdom) may supervise high-level paladins.
<P></P>
   <B>Fealty notes:</B> A paladin from a theocratic society need only pledge fealty to the church;
pledging fealty to the government isn't necessary, because the church is the
government. Pledging fealty to his family, a mentor, or other source is allowable,
but edicts of the church always take priority. (Again, direct commands from a
deity override orders from church officials.)
<P></P>
<P></P>

<P></P>
<P></P>
   The three relationships described above presume that both the church and
government are of lawful good alignment. In <I>no</I> case will a paladin pledge fealty to a neutral or evil organization or
individual. In a secular society with an evil government, he may pledge fealty to a
lawful good religion, but not to the government itself. In a neutral theocracy,
he must either pledge fealty to an underground or illegal lawful good
religion—one independent of the theocratic rulers—or he must separate from his society,
looking elsewhere for a government to serve.
<P></P>
   Keep in mind, too, that many variants are possible within these broad
descriptions. While a secular government may not officially recognize a church, a
secular ruler may maintain an informal relationship with a powerful or highly
charismatic religious leader. Through friendly persuasion or sheer force of
personality, the religious leader may coerce the secular ruler into passing laws
promoting religious doctrine. Although the government and state church may
theoretically exert equal influence in a co-dominant society, power struggles among the
religious elite may render the church impotent, letting government leaders do as
they please.
<P></P>
   A wise paladin keeps abreast of changes in the political landscape, lest he
inadvertently find himself serving a neutral or evil master. A corrupt official
may take over the government of a co-dominant society; while the state church
may remain lawful good, the government may become neutral or worse. An Errant
returning to his theocratic homeland from the field may discover that a cadre of
evil clerics has replaced the lawful good hierarchy of the state church.
<P></P>
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Renouncing Fealty</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
<P></P>
   Once a paladin discovers that his church or government has become neutral or
evil, he may immediately renounce his pledge of fealty without penalty. From
that point on, he is not obligated to follow their edicts. He must discard symbols
representing a renounced church or government. He must also give up equipment
that the church or government has loaned or given to him.
<P></P>
   A paladin who renounces his church must <I>immediately</I> pledge fealty to one of the following:
<P></P>
• A new lawful good church.
<P></P>
• A lawful good philosophy.
<P></P>
• The set of principles represented by the renounced church before it became
neutral or evil.
<P></P>
   A paladin who renounces his government has several options:
<P></P>
• He may continue serving in the same society. However, he is now obligated to
obey only the edicts of his faith (and any other nongovernmental individuals
or institutions to which he has pledged fealty).
<P></P>
• He may relocate to a different land, pledging fealty to a new lawful good
government.
<P></P>
• He may become an Expatriate (see Chapter 4).
