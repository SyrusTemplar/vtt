<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Initiative </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">Timing is everything in combat. Does a fighter try to get in a quick blow
before his enemy can react, or does he wait for a better opening? Who gets to go
first when a barbarian warrior is trying to cut down a mage casting a spell? The
initiative structure presented here is designed to answer those questions and
provide your character with better alternatives for combat.
