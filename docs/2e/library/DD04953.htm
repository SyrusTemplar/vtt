<B>Specialty:</B> Romantic Warrior (cavalier).
<P></P>
<B>Qualifications:</B> Standard ability scores. Gallants cannot be neutral evil. Most Gallants are
neutral good.
<P></P>
<B>Introduction:</B> <I>Life as a Gallant? Well, take it from me, Sir Gladiel, that life and love are
one and the same. I and my squire, Thorp, have been traveling the Dale Lands
since we met some four years ago. Always I am enriched by the charming young
ladies I encounter. Between them and the innocent children, I don't see how any man
can claim that we live in evil times.
<P></P>
For the past seven months I've been following the jousting circuit established
by his royal highness, Duke Mark of Gunwar Keep. It's been a splendid round of
competition. So far I've only won three of my 27 matches, but nearly two dozen
of the fairer sex will whisper my name for years to come, for I have entranced
them with my honest charm and pure heart.
<P></P>
Unfortunately, there are few men left these days who believe in love for
love's sake, who protect the innocent, and who strive for moral purity. Even
paladins are too caught up in their own righteousness to live life properly.
<P></P>
It seems that no one realizes that happiness is the goal of life. Winning and
losing is unimportant. All that matters is that you are happy and that your
actions do not deprive others of happiness.</I>
<P></P>
<B>Description:</B> There is no character as pure and romantic as the Gallant. He travels the
lands on the wings of romance and true love, stealing the hearts of the young and
lightening the spirits of the elderly. A Gallant seems to be blessed with a
grace and charm not given to others of his race.
<P></P>
Gallants are often mistaken for paladins or cavaliers. They dress and act much
like heroic warriors. But they are not driven by blood lust or the desire to
slay monsters for the sake of destroying evil. Gallants are romantics at heart.
They defend beauty, innocence, and love.
<P></P>
Yet the ways of love and romance cause many a famous Gallant to end his life
in tragedy. Shakespeare's Romeo would be such a Gallant.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> Gallants travel the lands in search of beauty and true love. Their romantic
outlook is such that they can always imagine a purer life just over the next
ridge. Thus, they never stay in one place for long. Because of this, most Gallants
own a horse to travel the lands.
<P></P>
The pastime of many Gallants is the medieval tournament. Here the skills of
jousting, dueling, archery, and other combat practices are honed. Such
tournaments draw crowds of young men and women before which the Gallants may perform.
Although the warrior classes usually win these tournaments, Gallants often win the
hearts of the onlookers and steal the day's glory away from the victorious
warriors. Of course, this causes a lot of friction between Gallants and jealous
warriors.
<P></P>
When a Gallant goes on an adventure, it is likely the result of some promise
to a fair maiden, to retrieve an item of beauty and love, or for some other
romantic cause. In these situations, the Gallant adopts the role of a heroic
fighter and charges forward regardless of the dangers that lie ahead.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> A Gallant should pick his secondary skill from one of the following: Armorer,
Bowyer/Fletcher, Groom, Hunter, Leather Worker, Weaponsmith.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Gallants must select the jousting lance for use in tournaments. Being the
romantic fighters that they are, it is important that Gallants always keep their
weapons in perfect order and well polished.
<P></P>
<B>Nonweapon Proficiencies: </B><I>Bonuses:</I> Dancing, Etiquette, Languages (Ancient), Poetry. <I>Suggested:</I> Animal Training, Armorer, Artistic Ability, Blacksmithing, Blind-fighting,
Bowyer/Fletcher, Languages (Modern), Leatherworking, Musical Instrument, Riding
(Land-Based), Reading/Writing, Singing, Weaponsmithing.
<P></P>
<B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Gallants are allowed to wear any form of armor, even those not normally
allowed to the core bard. However, Gallants are more interested in quality and
appearance than in the armor's actual protection. They will don a gleaming suit of
chain mail instead of a dented suit of plate mail. A suit of <I>studded leather +1</I> is more appealing to them than the gleaming chain, but<I> padded leather +4 </I>is even better (i.e., the bigger the magical bonus the better, regardless of
the armor type). However, of all forms of armor, elven chain mail is most prized
by the Gallant.
<P></P>
The same logic holds true for all of their equipment.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B>
<P></P>
<I>Essence of Purity:</I> Because Gallants are so infused with love, beauty, and the aspirations of a
romantic, they seem to hang onto life when others would allow it to slip away.
Thus, Gallants gain a bonus of 1 hit point each level (in addition to any
Constitution bonuses). Furthermore, if a Gallant fails a saving throw that will
result in his death, the saving throw is rerolled for a second chance.
<P></P>
Even when a Gallant is slain, he does not immediately drop over dead. Rather,
he lingers on long enough to recite one final tragic poem for those who will
listen. If the Gallant is slain in combat while defending love, innocence, or
beauty (including members of the opposite sex), the Gallant hangs on and fights
for another 1d4 rounds or until struck for additional damage equal to his level.
Then he recites his poem and dies.
<P></P>
<I>The Code of the Gallant:</I> Gallants all live by a code of ethics that has slowly evolved over the years.
If a Gallant is true to this code, he gains an inner confidence and peace that
results in a +2 bonus that can be applied to either his attack roll, damage
roll, Armor Class, or saving throw each round. During the round, the Gallant
player may decide to use the +2 bonus at any time before rolling the dice that will
be adjusted. Once the bonus is used in a round, it is not available again
until next round. The bonus cannot be split into two +1 modifiers.
<P></P>
If a Gallant breaks this code, he loses the +2 bonus until the infraction is
remedied. Further, he must seek out a priest who will listen to his
transgressions and cast atonement upon him (such priests will often require some form of
penance).
<P></P>
<P></P>
<B>The Code of the Gallant</B>
<P></P>
<P></P>
The Gallant will ...
<P></P>
... defend lovers, the innocent, and those of the opposite sex and aid them
in times of need (unless they are enemies or hostile).
<P></P>
... never marry nor solemnly vow to love only one person.
<P></P>
... never retreat from combat until allies of the opposite sex have done so
first (unless they are fellow Gallants).
<P></P>
... never overstay his welcome at any place.
<P></P>
... spend at least half of his money on the innocent or romance.
<P></P>
... own only what he can carry with him.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<I>Romantic Appeal: </I>The romantic appeal of a Gallant is so strong that non-hostile encounter
reactions are adjusted one level in a more friendly direction unless a successful
saving throw vs. paralyzation is rolled with a -1 penalty per three levels of the
Gallant. However, if the encounter includes mixed genders, those of the same
sex as the Gallant will actually be adjusted one level in the opposite direction
if they succeed on their saving throw (as jealousy rears its ugly head).
<P></P>
<I>Poetic Charm:</I> A Gallant who directs his attention to one person of the opposite sex can
attempt to win that person's heart. This requires the Gallant to perform many
subtle acts of wit and charm. Among these acts must be the recital of at least one
poem concerning the person. The entire effort takes a minimum of 1d10 turns,
after which the person rolls a saving throw vs. paralyzation with a -1 penalty
per three levels of the Gallant. Failure means that the person is affected as if
the Gallant cast a <I>charm</I> spell on him or her.
<P></P>
The effect is not magical and doesn't wear off over time, unless the Gallant
exploits or treats the person badly. Each such abuse results in another saving
throw being rolled to break the Gallant's charm. The Dungeon Master may apply
adjustments based on the situation. For example, if a Gallant asks a princess to
tell him where the king's treasure is hidden, she will gain a saving throw
adjusted by the degree of loyalty she has to her father. Striking the princess
(something greatly out of character for a Gallant) to gain this information is
likely to result in at least a +5 bonus to break free of the Gallant's charm.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances: </B>A Gallant is a wanderer who never builds a stronghold. Nor does he attract
followers at 9th level. At 5th level, however, a Gallant gains a squire (a
1st-level fighter). This squire is absolutely devoted to the Gallant, maintains his
equipment in top order, and accompanies him on all of his quests. If a Gallant's
squire is slain, a new squire arrives as soon as the Gallant acquires two more
experience levels.
