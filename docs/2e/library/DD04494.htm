<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Mirror of Retention:</B> This appears to be an ordinary round silver mirror, about 12 inches in
diameter. When the <I>mirror of retention</I> is hung in a 50 foot 0 50 foot or smaller room and the command word is
spoken, the mirror records all events occurring in the room for 24 hours. During this
time, the <I>mirror of retention</I> appears to be a normal mirror.
<P></P>
When the command word is spoken again, the mirror replays all the events it
recorded. The events appear as a series of silent images in the surface of the
mirror. By rotating the mirror clockwise, the images can be accelerated,
appearing as much as 10 times as fast as they occurred. Rotating the mirror
counter-clockwise causes the images to appear in reverse. If the mirror is held parallel
to the floor, the image freezes. Thus, by rotating the mirror and freezing the
images, the user can scan for events, review previously viewed images, or freeze
selected images for closer study.
<P></P>
When the command word is spoken a third time, the <I>mirror of retention</I> is cleared of all images and is ready to record new images for another 24
hours.
