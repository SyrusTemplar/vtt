<FONT SIZE="3">This powerful spell imbues the caster with the
physical fortitude and resilience of a troll. While the spell is in
effect, the caster regenerates 3 hit points per round until he
reaches his normal maximum. He also gains a troll&#146;s ability to
ignore dismemberment, decapitation, and other horrible injuries that
would normally incapacitate or kill him outright (although losing a
limb may prevent the caster from taking certain actions, such as
running, climbing, and other activities). Bleeding, wounding, being
reduced to negative hit points, and other effects that cause the
victim to lose hit points from round to round are ignored&#151;the
caster instead regains 3 hit points per round, up to his normal
maximum. If the caster is reduced to less than 0 hit points, he is
incapacitated and must make a system shock roll or lose all of his
highest level spells. The incapacitation lasts only until his
regeneration restores him to 1 hit point or more; he can move, fight,
and cast spells again as soon as his hit point total is positive.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>Trollish fortitude </I>does not provide the caster
with any defenses against lethal poison, disease, and other effects
that don&#146;t cause a loss of hit points. Hit points lost through
level draining, <I>vampiric touch</I>, or <I>vampiric regeneration </I>cannot
be regenerated since this represents damage to the victim&#146;s
life force, and not physical injury. In addition, fire damage and
acid damage cannot be regenerated. While the spell is in effect, the
caster can rejoin severed limbs simply by holding them in place, but
if the spell ends while a limb (which were already moving toward him)
is still separate from his body, he immediately suffers the full
effects of the injury.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The material component for this spell is a shred of
dried flesh from a troll&#146;s heart that must be pulverized into
dust. The dust is then sprinkled on the caster.</FONT></P>
