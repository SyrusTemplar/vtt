<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Greenwood Ranger</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Description:</B> The rarest and
certainly the most unusual ranger, the Greenwood Ranger, or Limbant,
combines characteristics of both humans and plants. The Greenwood
Ranger begins life as a normal human, but through resolute appeals to
the gods, he gradually acquires plant-like qualities that enhance his
relationship with the vegetable kingdom and endow him with remarkable powers.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A Greenwood Ranger resembles a normal
human covered from head to toe with a layer of thick brown bark,
similar to that of an oak tree. The bark on the back of his head and
the backs of his hands and arms is tinged with green; the green bark
enables him to absorb nutrients directly from the sunlight (see the
Special Benefits section below). He has no body hair, no teeth, and
his tapering fingers and toes look like gnarled branches. Tangles of
short roots grow from his feet and ankles.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from these physical differences,
the Greenwood Ranger moves, speaks, and behaves much like an ordinary
human. As his human qualities are dominant, he has a +2 bonus when
saving against<I> hold plant, charm plant</I>, and similar plant-related
spells. Otherwise, the Greenwood Ranger makes saving throws, attack
rolls, and ability checks as a normal human ranger.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp; <I>Becoming a Greenwood Ranger:</I> A ranger
must make the commitment to become a Greenwood Ranger at 1st level,
even though the Greenwood Ranger's special abilities are not acquired
until 4th level. From 1st through 3rd level, he is considered to be a
latent Greenwood Ranger. A latent Greenwood Ranger operates as the
standard ranger described in the <I>Player's Handbook</I>, though
following the Secondary Skill, Weapon Proficiency, and Nonweapon
Proficiency restrictions described below (and receiving the indicated
Bonus Proficiencies). He may wear any armor allowed a normal ranger.
He does not have any of the Greenwood Ranger's special benefits or
hindrances at this time.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; During this latency period, the ranger
must spend a minimum of three hours per week in silent prayer,
petitioning the gods to transform him into a Greenwood Ranger. It
isn't necessary for the player to keep track of the hours spent in
prayer; presumably, the character will set aside enough spare time to
meet this requirement. The gods may tolerate an occasional lapse--for
instance, the ranger may be too sick to pray in a particular
week--but the ranger is otherwise expected to keep up with his
prayers. If the ranger intentionally neglects his prayers on a
regular basis (as determined by the DM), the gods will inform the
ranger in a dream that he's no longer eligible to become a Greenwood
Ranger. The ranger is forced to abandon the kit, and may <I>not </I>take
another.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; When the latent Greenwood Ranger reaches
4th level, the gods give him a simple task to complete, involving the
protection or support of plant life. Typical tasks include assisting
a treant, replanting an area of forest devastated by fire, and
teaching a primitive tribe how to grow and harvest their own crops. A
latent Greenwood Ranger who fails to complete this task within a
month must spend an additional 1-4 months praying, at which time the
gods will grant a new task.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A latent Greenwood Ranger who completes
the task then locates an isolated area of forest or jungle, lies on
the ground, and covers himself with leaves and branches. He then
falls asleep for a full day. If disturbed before 24 hours elapse, the
transformation is interrupted; the ranger may try again at another
time. Otherwise, upon awaking, the ranger will have transformed into
a Greenwood Ranger. Once transformed, the Greenwood Ranger <I>cannot</I>
abandon this kit, although actions that would normally cost a ranger
his class result in the loss of spell use and other penalties
determined by the DM.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Requirements:</B> A Greenwood Ranger
must be human. Otherwise, the ability requirements are the same as
those for a normal ranger.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Primary Terrain:</B><I> Required:</I>
Forest or Jungle.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Role:</B> Because he must sacrifice a
portion of his humanity to become a Greenwood Ranger, a human drawn
to this kit usually has only a tenuous link with formal society. He
is an outsider, with few close friendships or family ties, capable of
walking away from the civilized world without regret. Orphans, social
outcasts, and eccentric personalities are good candidates to become
Greenwood Rangers.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Greenwood Rangers live deep in the forest
or jungle, far from urban centers. Most people tend to shun Greenwood
Rangers, repulsed by their appearance or fearful of their strange
powers. But their distrust is unwarranted. Greenwood Rangers are
gentle-natured, thoughtful souls to whom all life is precious. A
Greenwood Ranger will mourn the loss of a favorite shade tree as much
as the passing of a human companion. To the Greenwood Ranger, the
wilderness is a glorious, sacred place. If necessary, he will risk
his life to preserve it.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; In most cases, a Greenwood Ranger will
align with any adventuring party who shares his affinity for nature,
providing he agrees with their cause. A Greenwood Ranger tends to
keep to himself, offering his opinion only when asked and deferring
to the party's leader in most situations.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Bowyer/Fletcher,
Farmer, Forester, Woodworker/Carpenter.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> A Greenwood
Ranger's weapon proficiencies are limited to the following choices:
axe (any), bow (any), crossbow (any), dagger, knife, quarterstaff,
sling, spear, long sword, short sword.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonus:</I>
Herbalism. Required: Agriculture<I>. Recommended:</I> Carpentry,
Endurance, Foraging*, Swimming, Trail Marking*, Weather Sense. <I>Barred:</I>
Armorer, Blacksmithing, Fire-building, Engineering, Leatherworking,
Mining, Mountaineering, Navigation*, Riding (Land-based and
Airborne), Seamanship, Spelunking*, Stonemasonry, Weaponsmithing.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Armor/Equipment: </B>A Greenwood
Ranger can't wear armor. However, his bark-like skin provides
comparable protection. At 4th level, the Greenwood Ranger's skin
gives him an Armor Class of 5. For every level thereafter, the AC
increases by 1; an 8th level Greenwood Ranger, for example, has an AC
of 1. At 15th level, the Greenwood Ranger reaches his maximum AC of -6.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, Greenwood Rangers don't wear
clothing aside from a cloth loincloth or simple smock. Thanks to
their tough feet, shoes are unnecessary. Some Greenwood Rangers are
fond of decorative pins made of gems or colorful minerals. Greenwood
Rangers wear such pins by attaching them directly to their skin.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Species Enemy:</B> Any.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Followers:</B> A Greenwood Ranger will
have at least one treant follower at some point in his career.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Special Benefits:</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Speak with Plants:</I> The Greenwood
Ranger can speak with plants at will. This ability is similar to the
4th level priest spell, except it requires neither components nor a
casting time.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Photosynthesis:</I> Unlike a normal
human, the Greenwood Ranger has no need to drink or eat. He receives
nourishment directly from the sun. So long as he is exposed to
sunlight at least an hour per day, he stays healthy. He suffers 1-2
points of damage every day he goes without exposure to the sun.
Overcast days are sufficient to nourish a Greenwood Ranger.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A Greenwood Ranger satisfies his thirst
by dipping his feet in any pool or puddle of fresh water for 10
minutes every other day. Exposure to a light rain or soaking his feet
in a bucket will also suffice. If he goes without water for 48 hours,
he begins to suffer damage at the rate of 1-2 points per day.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Buoyancy:</I> A Greenwood Ranger
requires oxygen like any other human and is subject to drowning and
suffocation. However, because the Greenwood Ranger's woody skin makes
him naturally buoyant, he can't drown unless he's physically held underwater.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Rooting:</I> Upon reaching 8th level,
a Greenwood Ranger can accelerate healing by <I>rooting</I>. He may
attempt this once per week. To use this ability, the Greenwood Ranger
must bury his feet in the earth (not sand or snow; the soil must be
capable of supporting plant life) up to his ankles. He must stand
stationary and silent for 1-4 hours, taking no other actions during
that time. If interrupted, the rooting fails; he may try again the
following week. If uninterrupted, tiny roots sprout from his feet and
bury themselves into the ground, absorbing healing nutrients from the
soil. At the end of the rooting period, the roots withdraw, and the
Greenwood Ranger has recovered 3-12 (3d4) points of damage.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Limbing: </I>Under certain
circumstances, a Greenwood Ranger can grow an extra limb. The limb
grows from the center of the Greenwood Ranger's chest and functions
as a normal arm.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Greenwood Rangers of 10th level or
higher can attempt <I>limbing</I>. A Greenwood Ranger may make an
attempt once a month by lying on the ground and covering himself with
leaves, branches, and earth. For the next 24 hours, he enters into a
state of suspended animation, similar to that caused by a <I>temporal stasis</I>
spell. If the Greenwood Ranger is disturbed during this time, the
enchantment is broken and limbing will not occur. The Greenwood
Ranger can try again the following month.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Greenwood Ranger is undisturbed,
he awakens in 24 hours with a new limb extending from his chest. The
new limb may be useful to the Greenwood Ranger in several ways:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> The Greenwood Ranger
can wield three weapons at the same time. Attacks made with the third
weapon suffer a -2 penalty. The Greenwood Ranger's reaction
adjustment (based on his Dexterity) modifies this penalty, although
it can't result in a positive modifier. The Greenwood Ranger gains
only two additional attacks per round, regardless of the number of
attacks he's normally allowed. Therefore, a Greenwood Ranger able to
attack 3/2 with one weapon (once in the first round, twice in the
second) can attack 7/2 when using three weapons (three times in the
first round, four times in the second).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> The Greenwood Ranger
with a third limb receives a +3 bonus when punching, wrestling, or overbearing.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> A Greenwood Ranger
with a third limb can swim at 150% of his normal swimming speed. He
receives a +20% modifier to all climbing attempts.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> The extra limb helps
the Greenwood Ranger perform ordinary activities more efficiently.
For instance, he can carry three buckets of water at the same time or
wash dishes in half the normal time.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> The third limb
improves the Greenwood Ranger's performance when using certain
nonweapon proficiencies involving the hands. For example, when using
the juggling proficiency to catch items, he makes an attack roll vs.
AC 2 instead of AC 0. When using the weaving proficiency, he can
create three square yards of material per day instead of two. The DM
determines the extent of the improvement depending on the particular
proficiency and the attempted task.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Greenwood Ranger's new limb withers
and falls off in 1-4 days. A Greenwood Ranger can't have more than
one extra limb at a time.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Special Hindrances:</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Stiff Limbs:</I> The Greenwood Ranger
has a -5% penalty when trying to move silently. He gets no Dexterity
bonus to his armor class.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Vulnerability to Fire:</I> If an
opponent attempts any normal or magical fire-based attack against a
Greenwood Ranger, he qualifies for a +4 bonus to his attack roll and
a +1/die bonus to his damage roll. The Greenwood Ranger suffers a -4
penalty to all saving throws involving fire-based attacks. Any
fire-based attacks that hit inflict +1 hit point per die of damage.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp; Vulnerability to Extreme Climates: </I>Though
his skin provides protection in most environments, the Greenwood
Ranger risks damage from prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures.
After any full day spent in a climate where the temperature is below
freezing, or averages 100 degrees or more, a Greenwood Ranger must
make a Constitution check. Failure results in the loss of 1-4 hit points.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Limited Magic:</I> A Greenwood Ranger
can only learn and cast spells from the plant sphere. He uses the
ranger's normal spell progression (given in Table 5 in Chapter 1).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Reaction Penalty:</I> Because of his
bizarre appearance, the Greenwood Ranger suffers a -3 reaction
adjustment penalty when encountering any NPCs, with the exception of
learned nobles, sages, and other high level characters of good or
neutral alignment. Such worldly characters aren't intimidated by his appearance.</FONT></P>
