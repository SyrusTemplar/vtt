Any closeable item (book, box, bottle, chest, coffer, coffin, door, drawer,
and so forth) can be warded by a <I>fire trap</I> spell. The spell is centered on a point selected by the spellcaster. The item
so trapped cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed upon it. A <I>knock</I> spell cannot affect a fire trap in any way--as soon as the offending party
opens the item, the trap discharges. As with most magical traps, a thief has only
half his normal find traps score to detect a fire trap. Failure to remove it
successfully detonates it immediately. An unsuccessful <I>dispel magic</I> spell will not detonate the spell. When the trap is discharged, there will be
an explosion of 5-foot radius from the spell's center. All creatures within
this area must roll saving throws vs. spell. Damage is 1d4 points plus 1 point
per level of the caster, and half that total amount for creatures successfully
saving. (Under water, this ward inflicts half damage and creates a large cloud of
steam.) The item trapped is not harmed by this explosion.
<P></P>
The caster can use the trapped object without discharging it, as can any
individual to whom the spell was specifically attuned when cast (the method usually
involves a key word).
<P></P>
To place this spell, the caster must trace the outline of the closure with a
stick of charcoal and touch the center of the effect. Attunement to another
individual requires a hair or similar object from the individual.
<P></P>
The material components are holly berries.
