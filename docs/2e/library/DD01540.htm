<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> When a character uses a proficiency, either the attempt is automatically
successful, or the character must roll a proficiency check. If the task is simple or
the proficiency has only limited game use (such as cobbling or carpentry), a
proficiency check is generally not required. If the task the character is trying
to perform is difficult or subject to failure, a proficiency check is
required. Read the descriptions of the proficiencies for details about how and when
each can be used.
<P></P>
If a proficiency check is required, <A HREF="DD01538.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01538.htm">Table 37</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> lists which ability is used with each proficiency. Add the modifier (either
positive or negative) listed in Table 37 to the appropriate ability score. Then
the player rolls 1d20. If the roll is equal to or less than the character's
adjusted ability score, the character accomplished what he was trying to do. If
the roll is greater than the character's ability score, the character fails at
the task. (A roll of 20 <I>always</I> fails.) The DM determines what effects, if any, accompany failure.
<P></P>
Of course, to use a proficiency, the character must have any tools and
materials needed to do the job. A carpenter can do very little without his tools, and
a smith is virtually helpless without a good forge. The character must also
have enough time to do the job. Certainly, carpentry proficiency enables your
character to build a house, but not in a single day! Some proficiency descriptions
state how much time is required for certain jobs. Most, however, are left to
the DM's judgment.
<P></P>
The DM can raise or lower a character's chance of success if the situation
calls for it. Factors that can affect a proficiency check include availability and
quality of tools, quality of raw material used, time spent doing the job,
difficulty of the job, and how familiar the character is with the task. A positive
modifier is added to the ability score used for the check. A negative modifier
is subtracted from the ability score.

<I> Rath, skilled as a blacksmith, has been making horseshoes for years. Because
he is so familiar with the task and has every tool he needs, the DM lets him
make horseshoes automatically, without risk of failure. However, Delsenora has
persuaded Rath to make an elaborate wrought-iron cage (she needs it to create a
magical item). Rath has never done this before and the work is very intricate, so
the DM imposes a penalty of -3 on Rath's ability check.

When two proficient characters work together on the same task, the highest
ability score is used (the one with the greatest chance of success). Furthermore,
a +1 bonus is added for the other character's assistance. The bonus can never
be more than +1, as having too many assistants is sometimes worse than having
none.
<P></P>
Nonweapon proficiencies can also be improved beyond the ability score the
character starts with. For every additional proficiency slot a character spends on
a nonweapon proficiency, he gains a +1 bonus to those proficiency checks. Thus,
Rath (were he not an adventurer) might spend his additional proficiency slots
on blacksmithing, to become a very good blacksmith, gaining a +1, +2, +3, or
greater bonus to his ability checks.
<P></P>
Many nonplayer craftsmen are more accomplished in their fields than player
characters, having devoted all their energies to improving a single proficiency.
Likewise, old masters normally have more talent than young apprentices--unless
the youth has an exceptional ability score! However, age is no assurance of
talent. Remember that knowing a skill and being good at it are two different
things. There are bad potters, mediocre potters, and true craftsmen. All this has
much less to do with age than with dedication and talent.
