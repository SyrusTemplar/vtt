In one form or another, bows have been used since the early days of man. They
represented a great step in man's ability to cause damage, since the attacker
was at a considerable range from the target, not within reach of the enemy's
claws or melee weapons. The first bows were long, slender rods (also called
staves) with a string of animal tendon or plant fiber.
