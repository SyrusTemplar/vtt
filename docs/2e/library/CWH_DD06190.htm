Special spells are those that have limited use in combat. They do not offer
protection, inflict damage, or reveal information. Such spells assist the party
in these ways:

Though nearly all schools have their share of Special spells, the school of
illusion has a surplus of them, which is one reason why the illusionist is
considered by many to be the least useful specialist in combat.
<P></P>
This does not mean that Special spells are completely useless on the
battlefield. As with all types of magic, clever wizards will invariably find a variety
of uses for Special spells. For instance, the Special spell <I>dancing lights</I> does not cause blindness or inflict damage, but cast at the right time, it
could be used to distract an opponent, rendering him momentarily unable to
attack. In general, however, Special spells are the worst choices for a wizard
anticipating combat.
