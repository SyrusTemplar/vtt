Of all the other classes, wizards might best perform with a band of thieves.
They have no metal armor or heavy weapons to make noise, and spells such as
levitate and silence can provide cover for themselves, and even enhance the
abilities of the thieves. Magic users can be found in all alignments, and many have no
particular moral qualms about engaging in theft and other illicit activities.

Wizards can provide a variety of useful services to thieves as well. Even at
low levels, spells such as <I>sleep, charm person, spider climb</I>, and <I>Tenser's floating disk</I> offer obvious possibilities on a mission of thievery.
<P></P>
Many a thief guild has one or more wizards of low to medium level in its
employ, even occasionally among its leadership. Of course, extremely high level
wizards generally grow beyond the need for such companionship. High level wizards
associated with thieves generally treat the latter as if they were slightly
odiferous servants.
