When one character inflicts melee damage (but not as a result of missile
combat) on an enemy without being hit in return, she may force her foe to retreat,
driving him back with well-aimed blows. The attacker doesn’t have to force her
enemy back; she can decide to let him stand fast and not press the advantage. A
defender can ignore the requirement to retreat if he is 4 or more levels/Hit
Dice higher than the attacker or if he is two sizes larger than the attacker. A
retreat cannot occur if the enemy was knocked down during the round.
<P></P>
When a character retreats, he must move backward into one of his rear spaces
chosen by the attacker. If there is no place to retreat directly behind him, the
attacker must choose one of the retreating character’s flank spaces. If the
character is unable to retreat into any rear or flank space, he must roll a
successful saving throw vs. paralyzation or be knocked down in the space he is in.
In some special situations, the DM may allow a retreating character a chance to
avoid being forced back. This allows a character with his back to a cliff (for
example) to avoid giving ground.

The creature who forces a retreat may follow her retreating enemy, keeping her
foe in a threatened square. The attacker can instead choose to back her enemy
off and then hold her own position.

Retreats are good for breaking up enemy battle-lines or for maneuvering an
enemy into a battlefield hazard. Retreats can also be used to disengage from a
threatening creature by driving it back. Retreats don’t create attacks of
opportunity for the creature forcing the retreat; this is the end of the combat round
and everyone is finished attacking for the round. However, the retreating
creature may have been pushed into a situation where his rear or flank is exposed to
an enemy during the next round of combat.
