By means of this spell, the wizard causes an illusion that hides the actual
terrain within the area of effect. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to
look like a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain.
A pond can be made to look like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle
slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. The hallucinatory
terrain persists until a <I>dispel magic</I> spell is cast upon the area or until the duration expires. Individual
creatures may see through the illusion, but the illusion persists, affecting others
who observe the scene.
<P></P>
If the illusion involves only a subtle change, such as causing an open wood to
appear thick and dark, or increasing the slope of a hill, the effect may be
unnoticed even by those in the midst of it. If the change is extreme (for
example, a grassy plain covering a seething field of volcanic mudpots), the illusion
will no doubt be noticed the instant one person falls prey to it. Each level of
experience expands the dimensions of the cubic area affected by 10 yards; for
example, a 12th-level caster affects an area 120 yds. x 120 yds. x 120 yds.

The material components of this spell are a stone, a twig, and a bit of green
plant--a leaf or grass blade.
