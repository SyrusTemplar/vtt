A pinned creature can make unarmed or natural attacks with its free limbs or
can attack with a size S weapon. The pinned character’s original facing does not
affect these attacks; all the characters involved are entangled in a random
dogpile and the defender is assumed to be facing all the attackers
simultaneously—this is one disadvantage to overbearing attacks. If the defender inflicts a
critical hit with a weapon or natural attack, he can opt to inflict double damage
(or roll for a special effect according to the rules presented in <A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02717.htm.php.html#bcdf214c"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD02717.htm.php.html#bcdf214c">Chapter Six</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">) or force the attacker who is struck to release her. If the defender scores a
knockdown with a pummeling or weapon attack, the attacker who is struck must
release the defender.
<P></P>
The attacker cannot directly counter the pin, she must wait until the
attackers try to maintain the pin.
<P></P>
Attackers who have pinned a defender must make an opposed Strength roll each
round to maintain the pin. If a pinned defender wins the opposed Strength roll,
she breaks the pin and can spend a half move or an attack to stand up. She is
still grappled, however. If the defender wins the next opposed Strength roll,
she breaks free. If the defender wins initiative, she can force the roll herself
on her attack phase; this is the only time a defender can initiate the opposed
roll, which can be either an attack or a Strength roll, at the defender’s
option. If the defender loses or there is a tie, the defender remains grappled and
the attackers can skip the attack roll and go directly to the opposed Strength
roll on their next action phase. If the defender wins, she breaks free and can
finish the round normally.
