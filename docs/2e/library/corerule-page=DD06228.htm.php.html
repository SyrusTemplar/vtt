Wizards can research new spells by following the rules on pages 43-44 of the <I>Dungeon Master's Guide.</I> Most of the details are left to the DM so he can customize spell research
according to the needs of his campaign. If a DM is having trouble devising a
useable system or is not exactly sure how to proceed, some suggested rules are given
below. These rules apply to researching new spells; rules for researching
existing spells can be found at the end of this section. Again, all of these rules
are optional--the DM can make any adjustments or additions that seem reasonable
to him
