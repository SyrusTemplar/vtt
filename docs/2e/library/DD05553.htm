Just as evil thoughts and deeds create evil energies (see <A HREF="DD05548.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD05548.htm">Evil</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">, p. 57), good thoughts and deeds create good energies, resulting in priests
of the philosophy of Good.
<P></P>
The goal of these priests is to counter the spread of evil throughout the
universe. They work primarily to anticipate the deeds of evil beings, head them
off, and counter them whenever possible. They may or may not believe in Law; some
of them, chaotic good priests, break all sorts of laws and restrictions of
society in order to realize their good intentions.
<P></P>
The priests of this philosophy are on good terms with the priests of Divinity
of Mankind, Everything, Peace, Race, Redemption, and Wisdom. The priests of
this philosophy especially dislike the priests of Evil.
<P></P>
<B>Alignment:</B> This philosophy is good. Its priest may be of any good alignment (chaotic

any good alignment.

<B>Followers and Strongholds:</B> The followers are received at 9th level, and consist of one third-level
priest and two first-level priests of the same order, plus one fifth-level paladin,
three third-level paladins, and six first-level paladins to act as soldiers,
and one third-level mage and two first-level mages to act as special agents; the
priests and mages will be of the exact same alignment as the priest they
follow, while the paladins will automatically be lawful good. The priest may take the
following on adventures: One priest, two paladins, and one mage of his choice.
The priesthood will pay for half of the cost of stronghold construction at 9th
level. Such strongholds are often built with hospitals and libraries as part
of their construction, but this is not a requirement of the order.
