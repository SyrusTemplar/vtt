If you wish to create a character who is principally a Martial Artist, you
ought to take other Weapon and Nonweapon Proficiencies which are appropriate to
the classic martial-arts hero.
<P></P>
Almost all Weapon Proficiencies are appropriate for the character, including
all swords, bows, and polearms, and especially proficiencies with the Samurai
weapons from the <I>Equipment </I>chapter of this book.
<P></P>
Nonweapon Proficiencies which are especially appropriate include: (General)
Dancing, Direction Sense, (Warrior) Blind-fighting, Endurance, Running, (Rogue,
double slots) Jumping, Tightrope Walking, and Tumbling.
<P></P>
In campaigns with more classical and oriental elements to the martial artists,
Nonweapon Proficiencies such as (General) Artistic Ability, (Priest, double
slots unless Paladin) Ancient History, Astrology, Healing, Herbalism, Local
History, Musical Instrument, Reading/Writing, Religion, (Wizard, double slots unless
Ranger) Ancient History, Astrology, Herbalism, Reading/Writing, Religion.
<P></P>
Fighting Style Specializations, from this chapter, are also very appropriate
for the character.
<P></P>
Naturally, you won't be able to afford all these things for your Martial
Artist character, even if your DM does allow you the Intelligence bonus for extra
Proficiencies mentioned earlier in this chapter. Think not about having all these
abilities, but about taking specific abilities to make the character unique,
different from all the other PCs—even if they, too, are principally Martial
Artists.
<P></P>
For instance, one character could be a Paladin/Swashbuckler who takes Weapon
Proficiency with all Fencing Blades (two slots), Specialization with the Sabre
(one slot), and Specialization with Punching (one slot). Another character could
be a Ranger/Beast-Rider who takes Weapon Proficiency with all Bows (two slots)
and Proficiency and Specialization with Martial Arts (two slots). This way, no
two Martial Artists are likely to be even <I>remotely</I> alike.
