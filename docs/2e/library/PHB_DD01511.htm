</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A multi-class character improves in two or more classes simultaneously. His
experience is divided equally between each class. The available class
combinations vary according to race. The character can use the abilities of both classes
at any time, with only a few restrictions. Only demihumans can be multi-class
characters.
<P></P>
A dual-class character is one who starts with a single class, advances to
moderate level, and then changes to a second character class and starts over again.
The character retains the benefits and abilities of the first class but never
again earns experience for using them. There are some limitations on combining
the abilities of the two classes but, as long as minimum ability and alignment
requirements are met, there are no restrictions on the possible character class
combinations. Only humans can be dual-class characters.
