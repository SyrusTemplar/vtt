<P></P>
This is a bold, powerful, primitive god whose aspect is the thunderbolt. He
represents the destructive power of the sky and is a favorite god of warriors.
Because lightning sometimes hits trees and sets them ablaze, he has some minor
associations with fire and trees (especially oaks). He is also a god of storms.
<P></P>
However, the god himself is little concerned with the doings of mortals; he
has no objection to them worshipping him, and does grant some of his power to his
priests, but otherwise does not meddle much in mortal affairs.
<P></P>
His priests promote worship of the lightning-god for his power and his
indomitability. They encourage worshippers to emulate the god and his strength.
<P></P>
The lightning-god is male.

Forces, Fire, Nature, Race (Dwarf), Sky/Weather, Strength, and (especially) Thunder.
