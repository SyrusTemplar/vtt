<FONT SIZE="4"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Bonded Mount</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the paladin's greatest asset is
the bonded mount, usually a heavy war horse of exceptional strength,
courage, and intelligence that serves its master with steadfast
devotion. The bond is partly instinctual, partly divine; many believe
that the gods bring them together to insure the paladin has a
companion as noble as himself. Once joined, the mount remains loyal
so long as the paladin stays true to his principles.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A paladin becomes eligible to receive a
bonded mount at 4th level. The mount may appear any time thereafter.
Because the mount's arrival marks a major event in the paladin's
career, the DM may wish to delay its appearance. For instance, if a 4th-level
paladin is about to embark on a lengthy exploration of an
underground civilization, the DM may postpone the mount's appearance
until the paladin surfaces. In all cases, the DM determines when and
how the mount appears.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A paladin may never have more than one
bonded mount at a time. Further, he can have no more than one mount
in the same decade. If the mount dies or is otherwise lost, the
paladin won't become eligible for a replacement until 10 years after
the day he acquired his original mount.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Most bonded mounts are war horses, but
other creatures can also become mounts. Table 13 lists some of the
possibilities. The DM may augment Table 13 with other creatures, so
long as they are suitable for riding, reasonably intelligent, and of
good or neutral alignment.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The player may suggest the type of mount
he prefers for his paladin character, but the DM makes the final
choice. The DM may roll on Table 13 or select a particular creature.
Regardless of the method used, remember that only the strongest,
smartest, and bravest creatures become bonded mounts. To qualify as a
bonded mount, most creatures must meet certain statistic
requirements. These are recommendations, not rigid rules; the DM may
modify them as desired.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Hit Points.</B> Most mounts have at
least 6 hit points per hit die. A heavy war horse, for instance, has
21-27 hit points.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Intelligence.</B> A species' listed
Intelligence must be at least Animal (1). However, the Intelligence
of the mount may differ from the listed Intelligence of the species:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; If a mount's species normally has Animal
Intelligence, the mount itself has an Intelligence score of Semi-
(4). For example, the war horse species has an Intelligence of 1, but
a war horse bonded mount has an Intelligence of 4.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; If the mount's species normally has an
Intelligence score of Semi- or higher, the mount itself has +2 over
the highest typical score. The <I>Monstrous Manual</I> shows an
Intelligence range of 2-4 for the griffon; a griffon bonded mount has
an Intelligence of 6.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Morale.</B> A species' listed Morale
must be at least Unsteady (5-7). The Morale of a mount may exceed
that of its species:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; If a mount's species normally has Unsteady or
Average morale, the mount has a Morale of 11 (Steady).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; If the mount's species has a range of Morale
scores, the mount has the highest possible score. The griffon has a
Morale range of 11-12; a griffon bonded mount has a Morale of 12.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Upgraded mounts.</B> The DM may
improve any species of bonded mount by adding 2+2 HD to its hit dice
base and 3 to its movement base. An upgraded heavy war horse bonded
mount has 5+5 HD and a movement rate of 18.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Level Restrictions</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; To maintain balance, the DM should
consider restricting a low-level paladin's choice of bonded mounts.
For instance, the DM may decide that a paladin can't acquire a bonded
mount other than a war horse until he reaches 7th level, or an aerial
mount before 10th level.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternately, a DM may restrict <I>all</I>
paladins to the following choices:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; A paladin may only have a land-based mount
whose hit dice are less than or equal to the paladin's experience level.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; A paladin may only have a flying mount whose
hit dice are no more than half the paladin's experience level.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Using these guidelines, a 7th-level
paladin could have a 3+3 HD hippogriff as a bonded mount, but not a 7
HD griffon. If an unacceptable choice comes up on Table 13, roll
again or choose an acceptable mount.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Campaign Restrictions</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The DM should select bonded mounts with
the rest of the party in mind, as well as the parameters of the
campaign. A griffon mount may be disruptive if the paladin's
companions all ride horses, particularly if the griffon has a taste
for horseflesh. A hippocampus won't be much fun if the campaign
rarely takes the party near water. Again, disregard any inappropriate
outcome on Table 13 and make a new roll or choose something else.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Species Preference</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonding requires the voluntary
participation of the mount, and some species may have their own ideas
about what constitutes a suitable companion. Unicorns, for instance,
will only accompany female paladins, while light war horses may be
reluctant to bond with overweight riders. If a match doesn't work,
try a different combination.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Character Kits</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain character kits may have specific
mount requirements that take precedence over other considerations.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Paladin's War Horse</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The paladin's standard war horse is an
unusually hardy steed, slightly larger than a heavy war horse and
more heavily muscled. Its shaggy coat and thick hide provides it with
natural armor. Powerful legs enable it to move at the speed of a
medium war horse. It has a carrying capacity of 300, an encumbered
(half-speed) capacity of 450, and an encumbered (one-third movement)
capacity of 600.</FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Acquiring a Mount</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually, an opportunity to acquire a
bonded mount occurs within a few months after a paladin reaches 4th
level and declares himself receptive. The DM decides the exact time
and the circumstances, working the mount's appearance into the flow
of the campaign. The acquisition of a mount should be dramatic; after
all, it is a landmark of a paladin's career. Some possibilities:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Dream. </B>The paladin may experience
a dream, induced by the gods, where he sees a mount in a specific
location. He may dream of a wounded war horse on a battlefield,
surrounded by the corpses of lizard men. A unicorn may lie comatose
in a field of crimson flowers, overcome by the petals' anaesthetic
fragrance. The dream may be a premonition of an event yet to come or
an image of a situation that has already occurred. The paladin may
experience the dream with increasing regularity over several weeks.
The dream may become more vivid near the source. Eventually, he
encounters a scene exactly as portrayed in the dream. By overcoming a
final obstacle, such as fighting off predators from the wounded horse
or finding an antidote for the comatose unicorn, the paladin unites
with the bonded mount.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Reward.</B> A paladin may receive a
mount as a reward for an exceptional act of heroism. If he saves a
village from a family of red dragons or single-handedly turns back an
advancing army of orcs, the grateful community may present him with
their finest war horse. A paladin honoring his faith by building a
temple at the peak of a high mountain may slip and fall; as he
plummets into the abyss, a griffon swoops from the cloud and rescues
him, a gift sent by the gods.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Quest.</B> The paladin may hear of the
whereabouts of a potential mount and decide to track it down. The
information may come from a befriended sage, a rumor overheard at an
inn, or a mysterious document found in an abandoned castle. He may
spend weeks or months pursuing the lead, only to discover one or more
obstacles preventing him from bonding with the mount. The mount may
be guarded by a monster, in the custody of an evil monarch, or for
sale at an auction at an astronomical price. A spirited mount may
resist capture, leading the paladin on a wild chase through
treacherous terrain.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Magic.</B> A magical ceremony may
evoke the appearance of a bonded mount. A paladin may learn the
details of such a ceremony from an arcane parchment or a helpful
mage. A giant eagle trapped in a diamond may be freed if bathed in a
leprechaun's tears. A painting of a war horse on a cave wall may come
to life if the paladin burns a special incense. If he gathers the
scattered bones of a griffon and casts them into the sea, a living
griffon may arise from the water, ready to serve.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Recognizing a Bonded Mount</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Though a mount always knows when bonding
has occurred, it may not be immediately obvious to the paladin. The
DM shouldn't announce to the paladin that he's just bonded with a
mount, but instead describe the behavior of the mount and let the
paladin come to his own conclusions. Here are a few signs the paladin
might look for:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; The mount seems unusually bright. A war horse
immediately comes when called. A hippogriff fetches on command.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; The mount seems unusually brave, fearlessly
fighting alongside the paladin against formidable opponents or
intervening when a monster attempts an ambush.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; The mount seems unusually loyal and
affectionate. A horse trots placidly behind the paladin wherever he
goes, stopping when he stops, moving when he moves. A unicorn rests
its head in the paladin's lap.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; After observing such actions for a day or
two, even the dullest paladin should conclude that he's acquired a
bonded mount. To alleviate lingering doubts, a friendly spellcaster
may verify the bonding by casting <I>speak with animals</I> or a
similar spell.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Routine Care</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, a bonded mount has the same
needs as a normal steed. For the most part, it can care for itself,
grazing or hunting when hungry, and drinking when thirsty. Unless
ordered otherwise, a bonded mount rests when the paladin rests.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Occasionally, the mount may have to count
on the paladin for routine care. In the absence of a suitable pasture
or hunting grounds, the paladin will have to provide food. In a dry
desert, the paladin may have to share his water. Mounts often need
regular doses of salt to replace the salt lost from sweating. Sick or
wounded mounts may need medical attention.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Some mounts, horses in particular,
require daily grooming to stay healthy. The mount's coat must be
brushed, then wiped down with a soft cloth. Its hooves must be
thoroughly examined for cracks, imbedded stones, and other
abnormalities that could cause serious damage if left unattended. All
mounts appreciate expressions of affection, such as tasty snacks,
soft words, and soothing touches.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Special Traits</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; All bonded mounts, regardless of their
species, have the following traits in common:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Faithful service.</B> A bonded mount's
loyalty is unshakable. It obeys the paladin's commands without
hesitation, assuming it understands them. When the paladin is on
foot, the mount remains at his side, following wherever he goes
unless ordered to stay put.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; On the battlefield, the mount remains
with the paladin, even in the face of impending death. A bonded mount
will never abandon the paladin to save itself; in game terms, the
mount is considered to have Fearless (20) Morale when fighting beside
or defending the paladin.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A bonded mount is indifferent to the
paladin's companions, unless it has been specifically trained to
protect them or respond to their commands. Should a companion
approach the paladin in what the mount perceives as a threatening
manner, the mount may snort or stamp its hooves as a warning, or even
attempt to push the companion away. Once reassured by the paladin,
the mount withdraws, though it may keep a wary eye on the companion.
The mount responds to nonplayer characters in the same way, ignoring
nonhostile NPCs who keep their distance, reacting strongly to those
who appear to pose a threat.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Comes when called.</B> A bonded mount
comes immediately to the paladin's side when summoned. The mount
responds to a shout, whistle, hand gesture, or any audible or
physical signal of the paladin's choice. The paladin must demonstrate
the signal to the mount only once; the mount unfailingly responds to
the signal ever after.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Handling.</B> The paladin can always
calm an excited or agitated bonded mount. The Animal Handling
proficiency isn't required.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Riding.</B> A paladin requires neither
the airborne nor the land-based riding proficiency to ride his bonded
mount. Additionally, the paladin can perform all of the feats
associated with the proficiency that applies to his mount's species.
Feats normally requiring proficiency checks (described in </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01538.htm.php.html">Chapter
5</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> of the <I>PH</I>) instead require
Riding checks. For land-based mounts, make the Riding check against
the paladin's Wisdom score, modified by +3. For airborne mounts, the
Riding check equals the paladin's Wisdom &#150;2. (These modifiers
are identical to the standard check modifiers given on </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01538.htm.php.html">Table
37</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> in the <I>PH</I>.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless trained otherwise, a bonded mount
allows only the paladin to ride it, bucking and snorting furiously if
anyone else makes an attempt. A soothing word from the paladin
prevents the mount from actually harming an unwanted rider.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Combat.</B> A bonded mount
aggressively defends its paladin against attacks, biting and kicking
until the attacker withdraws. The mount also attacks any target
indicated by the paladin, continuing its attacks until the paladin
orders it to stop.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Training</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A bonded mount can perform all of the
actions discussed in &quot;Special Traits.'' A paladin may also wish
to train the mount to perform additional tricks and tasks. Tricks are
simple actions performed in response to specific commands; such
actions require no independent decision-making from the mount. Tasks
are more complex actions which may require multiple steps and a bit
of improvisation. Because of its rapport with its paladin, a bonded
mount can master an impressive repertoire of tricks and tasks, and
can learn more efficiently than other animals.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Animal Training proficiency isn't
necessary to train a bonded mount, though the procedure is similar.
The paladin tells the DM which trick or task he wants to teach. If
the DM approves, the paladin begins the training. It takes 1-2 weeks
to teach a trick to a bonded mount, and 2-5 (1d4+1) weeks to teach it
a task. At the end of the training period, the paladin makes a Wisdom
check (using his own Wisdom score, not the mount's). If the check
succeeds, the mount has learned the trick or task. If the check
fails, the paladin may try again, investing another 1-2 weeks of
training for a trick, or 2-5 weeks for a task. When the training
period ends, he makes a second Wisdom check. If this check fails, the
mount is incapable of learning that particular trick or task. A
bonded mount can learn 9-20 (1d12+8) tricks and tasks, in any combination.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A paladin can use the Animal Training
proficiency to train other animals while training his mount. He can
train three animals, including the mount, at the same time.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A paladin must regularly work with the
mount to teach it a trick or task. The exact time spent is less
important than working with the mount every day. If the paladin falls
behind&#151;for instance, if he skips a training session several days
in a row&#151;the DM may rule that he must start the training again,
beginning a new period of 1-2 or 2-5 weeks.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Several examples of tricks and tasks
suitable for bonded mounts are described below. A paladin isn't
confined to this list; he may attempt to teach his mount any task or
trick he can think of, so long as the mount is physically and
mentally capable of performing it and the DM approves.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A mount executes most tricks and tasks
automatically; die-rolls or success checks aren't needed. The DM may
ask for an ability check if the outcome is uncertain (for instance, a
mount successfully walks a plank spanning a deep chasm if it makes a
Dexterity check). Alternately, the DM may assign a percentile chance
of success (the mount has a 30% chance of safely crossing the chasm).
The DM adjudicates all combat-related tricks and tasks like any other
combat action, using attack and damage rolls as necessary.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Exceptionally intelligent mounts.</B>
Mounts who can communicate with spoken language and whose
Intelligence scores are comparable with those of humans need no
training. Such creatures perform any tricks or tasks their paladins
ask them, within reason.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Sample Tricks</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Speak.</B> The mount neighs, growls,
or makes some other predetermined sound on command.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Pack Animal.</B> Normally, bonded
mounts resist being used as pack animals. Some are only comfortable
carrying human riders; others feel that hauling equipment is beneath
their dignity. Once a mount masters this trick, however, it
effortlessly shifts between carrying riders and gear. To avoid
chafing and sores, a mount usually requires a pack saddle when
carrying gear. The cost of a pack saddle for a horse is 5 gp. The
cost of pack saddles for other species ranges from 5-15 gp, depending
on the animal's size and the DM's decision.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Pursue.</B> Normally, a mount breaks
off its attacks when an aggressor withdraws. When taught to pursue,
the mount chases a retreating enemy. If the mount catches the enemy,
it resumes its attacks. The mount may pursue indefinitely, returning
when the enemy has been defeated or has escaped, or it may be taught
to return at the paladin's command.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Stay.</B> The mount stands still until
the paladin gives it permission to move.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Sample Tasks</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Rescue.</B> If the paladin falls
unconscious on the battlefield, the mount drags him to safety, either
to a predetermined location, such as the paladin's campsite, or to
the nearest safe location.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Strategic attacks.</B> In a combat
encounter, the mount makes its own decisions regarding strategy and
choice of targets. The mount may temporarily leave the paladin to
lure away a charging monster, or it may attack an enemy that the
paladin doesn't see (such as one about to plunge a knife into the
paladin's back).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Guard duty.</B> The mount stands guard
at a campsite or other location, watching for intruders. Should the
mount spot an intruder, it reacts as directed by the paladin. It may
alert a sleeping paladin (or other designated character) by nudging
him awake, crying out, or attacking.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; As some mounts may not be able to
distinguish between friendly and hostile intruders, the mount will
most likely react if <I>any</I> person or creature enters the guarded
area. To improve the mount's value as a guard, the paladin may teach
it to respond to a specific type of intruder (say, anyone riding a
horse, or any ogre). Recognizing a specific type of intruder is
considered a distinct trick, requiring a separate training period. In
other words, the mount must first learn the <I>task</I> of guard
duty, then any number of <I>tricks</I> to recognize specific types of intruders.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Search.</B> The follower can search
for a particular type of item in a general location and, if it finds
it, return the item to the paladin. Suitable items include gems,
weapons, bundles, flasks, or parchments. Suitable locations include a
small cave, a shallow valley, or the interior of a building. The
paladin must show the mount a sample of the sought object, the more
specific, the better. (If the paladin wants a particular weapon from
an armory, he must show the mount a close copy.) The paladin must
also designate the area to be searched. The mount won't search
indefinitely, usually returning within an hour if it can't find the item.</FONT></P>
<P> 
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If the circumstances of the search are
unusually difficult, the DM may call for ability checks. For
instance, if the mount searches an armory for a particular golden
sword, but the building contains dozens of similar swords, the DM may
require the mount to make an Intelligence check. The mount locates

<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A mount may also be taught to locate
specific people. However, a mount can't locate a person that it
hasn't been taught to recognize. The mount must first learn the<I> task</I>
of searching, then any number of <I>tricks</I> to recognize specific
individuals. A bonded mount can <I>always</I> recognize its paladin;
no special training is required.</FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Because bonded mounts are living,
breathing entities with thoughts and feelings of their own, the DM
should consider running them as nonplayer characters. Like a human or
demihuman NPC, a bonded mount has a distinct personality. It may be
stubborn or bold, complacent or curious, foolhardy or cautious. It
may have an aversion to bearded strangers, a fear of water, a
fondness for apples. Exceptionally intelligent mounts may communicate
with head shakes, foot stomps, or a spoken language, letting them
serve as confidantes and advisors.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Parting Company</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Under normal circumstances, a bonded
mount serves its paladin for no more than 10 years. During this time,
the paladin may voluntarily dismiss the mount if it becomes crippled
or ill, if the paladin's journeys take him to a terrain inhospitable
to the mount, or for any other reason of the paladin's choice. The
mount instinctively knows when the paladin dismisses it, and responds
by dutifully wandering away. The DM should stage this parting as a
significant event similar to the mount's arrival.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If the paladin returns to the area where
he dismissed the mount and calls out for it, the mount may return. A
dismissed mount returns if all of the following conditions exist:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; The mount is alive and ambulatory.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; The mount hasn't left the area and can hear the
paladin's call.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Ten years haven't yet passed since the day the
paladin originally acquired the mount.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; The paladin hasn't acquired a new, conventional
mount in the interim.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; The DM approves of the return.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A bonded mount abandons its paladin for
either of the following reasons:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; Ten years have passed since the mount
originally bonded with the paladin. Many steeds, particularly horses,
are too old for a life of adventure at this age. Others, like
unicorns, become restless for new experiences.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; After a decade of service, the paladin
may voluntarily dismiss his mount. Otherwise, the mount simply
disappears at the earliest opportunity. A paladin in good standing
then becomes eligible for a new bonded mount. The opportunity may
arise within the next few months, under the guidelines described in
the &quot;Acquiring a Mount'' section above. The new mount may be a
different species from the previous mount.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">&#149; If the paladin is stripped of his special
abilities as a consequence of violating his ethos (see </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dDD05387.htm.php.html">Chapter
3</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">), the bonded mount loses its
allegiance to the paladin and escapes at the earliest opportunity.
Once stripped of his abilities, a former paladin can never again
acquire bonded mounts.</FONT></P>
