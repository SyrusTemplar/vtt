<P></P>
<B>Description:</B> This character is a researcher. He's most at home when he's poring over
books, scrolls, papyri, clay tablets and other old writings. He's not forbidden from
fighting, but is more likely to try to straighten out a bad situation with
reason, personal charisma, or even trickery than with a weapon. His life is
dedicated to the assimilation of knowledge (and, usually, the transmission of that
knowledge to new generations).
<P></P>
A scholar priest must have an Intelligence ability score of 13 or better.
<P></P>
This kit cannot be abandoned. A scholar can break off correspondence with
other scholars, can choose not to teach, can decide not to do any studying or
writing for as long as he likes, but he can always re-enter the academic world.
<P></P>
<B>Barred</B>: Priests of the following gods, forces and philosophies cannot take this kit:
Competition, Fertility, Life-Death-Rebirth Cycle, Strength, and War.
<P></P>
Priests of the following types are most appropriate for this kit: Arts,
Crafts, Culture, Divinity of Mankind, Literature/Poetry, Music/Dance, and Wisdom.
<P></P>
<B>Role:</B> In the campaign, this priest is motivated by his desire for knowledge. He'll
often be tempted by adventures where he's likely to be able to learn something.
If an adventuring party is going to a ruin where a famous library once stood,
he'll eagerly join on the faint hope that some scrap of that library still
survives. He'll be part of expeditions to visit famous sites or ancient beings who
might tell him stories of the past or solve old mysteries. He might be part of
an adventure just so that he can chronicle it and preserve its events in
history.
<P></P>
<B>Secondary Skills:</B> The Scholar Priest must take Scribe as his secondary skill.
<P></P>
<B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Required: None. Recommended: Any appropriate to the priest's actual
priest-class. Note: See &quot;Special Benefits,&quot; below.
<P></P>
Nonweapon Proficiencies: Bonus Proficiency: Reading/Writing. Recommended:
(General) Artistic Ability, Etiquette, Heraldry, Languages (Modern), (Priest)
Ancient History, Astrology, Languages (Ancient), Local History.
<P></P>
<B>Equipment: </B>The scholar-priest must always have writing material, quill and ink with him.
If ever he loses them, he must regain or replace them as soon as possible, and
in the meantime will be recording his experiences in any fashion he can find.
Other than that, this kit makes no demands on the way he spends his money.
<P></P>
<B>Special Benefits:</B> The Scholar Priest can &quot;spend&quot; any of his Weapon Proficiency slots on
Nonweapon Proficiencies instead. He doesn't have to; he can adhere to the normal
pattern of proficiency choice that is appropriate to his priest-class. But if he
wishes he may turn Weapon Proficiency slots into Nonweapon slots and thereby
become a very skilled character. Also, the Scholar receives a +3 reaction bonus from
other scholars, admirers of scholastic concerns, writers, journalists, and
people who imagine that they are scholars. Because of this, when the party thinks
it is in a situation when no one is willing to help, it may turn out that the
mousy clerk, antagonistic king or homely witch they met is an admirer of or even
correspondent with the Scholar Priest and will help them.
<P></P>
<B>Special Hindrances:</B> Many scholars are egotistical, and debates between scholars can become very
heated and personal. Whenever the DM rolls a reaction check from another
scholar, he should first roll 1d6. On a 1, the player-character scholar gets a <I>-6</I> reaction adjustment instead of a +3, because at some time in the past (or
even the present) he argued or disagreed with this scholar's pet opinion and
offended him completely.
<P></P>
<B>Wealth Options:</B> The Scholar Priest gets the standard 3d6x10 gp starting gold.
<P></P>
<B>Races:</B> No special limitations.
