?? Before players create their characters, the DM should examine each of the kits
and consider the following questions:
<P></P>
?? <B>Is this kit appropriate to the campaign world?</B> The DM may exclude any kit that doesn't fit into the campaign. In a campaign
world dominated by a single religion, the DM may deem the Votary kit
inappropriate. The Militarist kit may not be relevant in a world with few organized
armies. Before players create their characters, the DM should tell them which are
forbidden.
<P></P>
<B>?? Do the players need additional information about the kit?</B> Any campaign details that may influence the choice of a kit should be
revealed to the players. For example, if the local queen has canceled all privileges
for diplomats, a player might avoid the Envoy kit.
<P></P>
?? <B>Are there changes in any kit?</B> The DM is free to make adjustments in the kit descriptions. He may decide,
for example, that all Divinates must belong to a particular religion, or that all
Wyrmslayers must take Blind-fighting as one of their initial proficiencies.
All changes should be explained to the players before they create their
characters.
