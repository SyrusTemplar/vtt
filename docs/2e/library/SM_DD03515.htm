Bonus Spell Points for High Intelligence
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> Just as priests of extraordinary Wisdom receive greater than normal spell
powers, extremely intelligent wizards can gain a few extra spell points to reflect
their superior minds and memorization skills. Under this optional rule, wizard
characters gain a number of bonus spell points equal to their maximum number of
languages, based on their Intelligence score. These spell points can be spent
any way the character desires, as long as he doesn-t exceed his maximum number
of spells per level (see <A HREF="DD03509.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03509.htm">Table 17</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> ). The bonus points are shown on <A HREF="DD03516.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03516.htm">Table 19</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> : Bonus Spell Points for Intelligence.
<P></P>
As noted on the <A HREF="DD03509.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03509.htm">table</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> , a wizard with an Intelligence of 14 or better gains enough bonus points to
memorize one additional 1st-level spell, which is comparable with the
traditional priest bonus of an additional 1st-level spell for a Wisdom of 13 or better.
A wizard with an Intelligence of 17 has enough points to use this bonus to gain
an extra 2nd-level spell, or one extra 1st-level spell with a couple of spell
points to spare.
<P></P>
DMs, take note: The cumulative effects of specialist wizard bonuses, signature
spells, and this optional rule could allow a 1st-level wizard to begin play
with as many as four 1st-level spells memorized at once! Obviously, this is a
very significant boost in power for a low-level character. Allowing a character to
gain bonus spell points for his Intelligence score is a reasonable optional
rule, but it also inflates the game by drastically increasing the power of 1st-
to 3rd-level wizards. It's a good idea to strictly enforce the limits on the
maximum number of spells of each level (see <A HREF="DD03509.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03509.htm">Table 17</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> ) permitted to a wizard character.
