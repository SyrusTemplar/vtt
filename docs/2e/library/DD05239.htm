This maneuver is designed to knock opponents down.
<P></P>
When using the Pull/Trip maneuver, the attacker announces his intention when
it's his turn to attack. He describes how he's performing the maneuver to the
DM, who may rule that it's impossible.
<P></P>
If it is possible, though, the attacker rolls vs. the target's AC as with any
normal attack.
<P></P>
The target then rolls 1d20 against his Dexterity. If he succeeds, he stays on
his feet. If he fails, he falls down. Modifiers to his Dexterity include:
<P></P>
<P></P>
+6 Target Was Not Moving
<P></P>
â€“3 Target Was Unaware of Attack
<P></P>
<P></P>
The Pull/Trip maneuver is best performed on someone who is moving and unaware
of you. A target who is standing still (not walking or running) and is aware of
his attacker is very hard to knock down.
