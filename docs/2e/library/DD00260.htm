Alignment is a shorthand description of a complex moral code. It sketches out
the basic attitudes of a person, place, or thing. It is a tool for the DM. In
sudden or surprising situations, it guides the DM's evaluation of NPC or
creature reactions. By implication, it predicts the types of laws and enforcement
found in a given area. It affects the use of certain highly specialized magical
items.
<P></P>
For all the things alignment is, there are some very important things that it
is not. It is not a hammer to pound over the heads of player characters who
misbehave. It is not a code of behavior carved in stone. It is not absolute, but
it can vary from place to place. Neither should alignment be confused with
personality. It shapes personality, but there is more to a person than just
alignment.
