The following information expands the details found in the <A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01627.htm.php.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="corerule-page%3dPHB_DD01627.htm.php.html">Player's Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> with regard to barding, tack, harness, and other items used with horses and
mounts. Optional rules are provided to allow the DM to match the armor of mounts

The information in this section centers on horses, because this type of mount
is the most commonly encountered. Much of this material, however, can be easily
adapted for other types of mounts. The following sections deal mainly with
barding, as this will have the most direct effect on adventuring and combat.
