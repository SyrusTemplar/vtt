<B>Description:</B> Arctic druids feel at home on the frozen polar tundra or on the slopes of
snowcapped mountains and ancient glaciers. They even venture at times across
lifeless ice fields to assist lost animals. If an Ice Age took place in the distant
past, arctic druids may very well claim to belong to the oldest druidic branch,
tracing their ancestry all the way back to the days when humans huddled within
caves.
<P></P>
Glydo, a typical arctic druid, (illustrated above) concerns himself more with
animals than with plants. Guardian of caribou herds, penguins, auks, seals,
polar bears, and other arctic and subarctic animals, he relentlessly pursues those
who exploit animals out of desire for profit. However, he faithfully befriends
hunters and trappers who respect the land and take from it no more than they
need.
<P></P>

<B>Armor and Weapons Permitted:</B> Leather armor, wooden shield; club, dagger, dart, harpoon, knife, sling,

druid's minor access to the Plant sphere reflects the less abundant plant life in
arctic climes.)
<P></P>
<B>Granted Powers:</B> An arctic druid like Glydo has the following granted powers:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Receives a +2 bonus to all saving throws vs. cold-based attacks.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Learns the languages of intelligent monsters whose natural habitats are
tundra, arctic, and subarctic regions. The arctic druid gains one extra proficiency
slot for this purpose every three levels (at 3rd, 6th, etc.). Such languages
include those spoken by ettins, frost giants, ice toads, selkies, werebears,
white dragons, winter wolves, verbeeg, yeti, and others.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Ignores the effects of freezing weather upon himself at 3rd level.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Identifies with perfect accuracy arctic plants and animals, thin ice (ice that
would give way under the weight of a person or a sled), and pure water at 3rd
level.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Passes over ice and snow without leaving a trail and can move over such
terrain at full movement rate at 3rd level.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>?</SPAN></FONT> Shapechanges up to three times a day at 7th level. The druid can assume the
form of a land mammal, marine mammal, or bird that dwells in arctic and subarctic
climates: a caribou, penguin, polar bear, seal, reindeer, snowy owl, wolf,
wolverine, and so on. The druid can't take the same animal's shape more than once
each day.
<P></P>
Special Limitation: An arctic druid is used to a cold climate and suffers a -1
penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks in environments
with temperatures above 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
<P></P>
<B>Holy Symbol and Grove: </B>Glydo, as an arctic druid, uses as his holy symbol a bone of an arctic animal
that has been carved into the shape of a knife, whistle, flute, or other
instrument. If the druid dwells beyond the arctic tree line, he chooses as his
&quot;grove&quot;--usually near a glacier--an ancient cave whose walls are covered with
prehistoric paintings of animals.
