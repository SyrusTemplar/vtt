</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> To make a saving throw, a player rolls a 20-sided die (1d20). The result must
be equal to or greater than the character's saving throw number. The number a
character needs to roll varies depending upon the character's group, his level,
and what the character is trying to save himself from. A character's saving
throw numbers can be found in <A HREF="DD01724.htm"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01724.htm">Table 60</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.

Saving throws are made in a variety of situations: For attacks involving
paralyzation, poison, or death magic; petrification or polymorph; rod, staff, or
wand; breath weapon; and spells. The type of saving throw a character must roll is
determined by the specific spell, monster, magical item, or situation involved.
