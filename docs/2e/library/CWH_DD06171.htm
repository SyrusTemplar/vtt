Many wizards serve as administrators, advisors, or teachers, or hold other
positions of responsibility in their communities. The local citizens are likely to
barrage such wizards with a constant stream of requests for favors and
assistance. Most of these requests will be trivial and easily addressed, but others
might require the PC wizard to recruit the help of his player character
companions.
<P></P>
Sometimes, a seemingly innocuous request (&quot;Something's been into my crops-- I
think it's a bunch of kids. Could you stop them?&quot;) might lead the PC wizard to
believe that more is happening than meets the eye. He might summon his
companions to help him investigate, and their discoveries could be the beginning of a
long campaign. (The party discovers clawed footprints among the damaged crops.
The footprints lead to a nearby forest, then abruptly vanish. What's going on?).
