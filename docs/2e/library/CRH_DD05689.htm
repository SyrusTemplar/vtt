Regardless of whether they're wardens of private game reserves, arctic
explorers, or freelance monster hunters, all rangers share a set of special abilities
that distinguish them from other character classes. Just as wizards have an
innate aptitude for casting spells and thieves have a natural talent for picking
pockets, rangers have the inborn ability to track other creatures, hide in
shadows and move silently in outdoor settings, react to specific enemies, empathize
with animals, understand the complexities of nature, survive in extreme
conditions, build strongholds, and acquire followers. Quite a list--but that's what
makes the ranger such an exceptional character.

?-We'll spend this chapter examining each of the ranger's abilities in detail,
looking at their applications and special rules. The ranger's ability to
attract followers--a topic complex enough to merit special attention--will be saved
for the next chapter.
