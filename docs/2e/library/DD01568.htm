<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Gaming:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="3">The character knows most common games of chance and skill, including cards,
dice, bones, draughts, and chess. When playing a game, the character may either
play out the actual game (which may take too much time for some) or make a
proficiency check, with success indicating victory. If two proficient characters
play each other, the one with the highest successful die roll wins. A character
with gaming proficiency can also attempt to cheat, thus gaining a +1 bonus to his
ability score. If the proficiency check for the game is 17 to 20, however, the
character has been caught cheating (even if he won the game).
