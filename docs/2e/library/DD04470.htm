<TITLE>Contracts of Nepthas-- Miscellaneous Magic (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>
<script src="jscripts.js"></script><link rel="stylesheet" href="toc.css"></HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><B>Contracts of Nepthas: </B>These magical contracts are written in black ink on golden-brown vellum. The
contracts are usually found in ivory tubes, each tube containing 1d6 contracts.
The contracts are blank and can be filled in by the user. The contracts will
radiate magic if detected, but carry no overt signs of their special nature.
<P></P>
The <I>contract of Nepthas</I> automatically places an enchantment upon any persons who sign it in order to
insure that both parties hold to the agreement. Anyone who has signed a <I>contract of Nepthas</I> and breaks the contract is struck deaf, blind, and dumb. The effects of the
punishment last until they are removed with a <I>remove curse</I>.
<P></P>
A person who is both deaf and blind suffers a -8 penalty to his attack rolls
and his opponents gain a +8 bonus to their attack rolls. He loses all bonuses
for Dexterity and suffers -2 penalties to saving throws versus spells,
petrification/polymorph, and rod, staff, or wand.
<P></P>
A contract involves two parties agreeing on a set of conditions. The
conditions are usually very specific, but if they are not, they might be perverted in
the same way that a <I>wish</I> spell might be misinterpreted. If a group of adventurers signs a contract
with a king stating that they will slay a dragon in the Northern Hills by the eve
of the new moon, slaying any dragon will fulfill the contract, although the
king may have had a specific dragon in mind. If the king agrees to pay the
adventurers upon the completion of the task, the king had better have the money when
the party returns.
<P></P>
Contracts signed by persons under the influence of <I>charm</I> and similar spells are null and void. A forged contract is also void. If any
person who signs a contract dies before its completion, that person's
obligation is ended. Note, however, that if a group of adventurers signs a contract and
one of their members dies, the survivors are still bound to the contract.
<P></P>
A deadline for both parties' responsibilities must be stated in the contract
in order for it to be activated.
