<FONT SIZE="4"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Chapter 5: Lindendale-- A
Typical Halfling Village</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Lindendale is a small community, a town of halflings
that could exist in almost any campaign world. It is presented here
for two reasons: (1) it provides a look at a typical halfling
village, with examples of households and the various trades and
skills represented there, and (2) it can be used as a home base for
launching an all-halfling campaign, as it can easily be dropped into
any ongoing campaign.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The village is mapped on page 123. It lies in a
sheltered valley on the south side of a long, forested ridge. About a
mile to the south of the map, a major road runs from east to west. A
small dirt track leads from this highway to the village.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">A placid stream, the Lindenbrook, winds along the base
of the ridge. While no more than three or four feet deep, the creek's
silty bottom makes fording difficult.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON">1. Inn of the Brass Tankard</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">This homey place is the first building a visiter sees
upon approaching Lindendale. It is a two-story structure of
whitewashed wood with brown shutters and a round, oversized door. The
common room is large enough for humans but still cozy to halflings.
The guest rooms come in two sizes, for Big Folk (upper level) or
small folk (lower level), with appropriately-sized furniture in each.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The innkeeper, Gwiston Shortwick, lives here with his
wife Lucretia, their four daughters, and Lucretia's elderly mother;
the family quarters are in a burrow at the south end of the inn.
Several other halflings work here as stablehands and waitresses, but
they live in the village with their families.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON">2. Mill and Bakery</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Dottery Dale is a bawdy halfling wench who runs the
village mill and also bakes fabulous bread and cakes. She has two
brothers and a sister who live here as well, each of them married
with several children--but the unmarried Dottery is unquestioned head
of the household.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The Millbridge is attached to the great wooden
building and is the only dry means of crossing the Lindenbrook for
more than a mile in either direction.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON">3. Cheese Factory</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Hofflik Kaese is the master cheesemaker here. He takes
all the milk that the local dairies can provide and turns it into a
sharp, white cheese (called &quot;Lindenbrook&quot;) that is highly
prized within the local area and beyond. It is the village's major export.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Hofflik, a bachelor, lives in a small set of rooms
beside his factory. Two small compartments within the shop itself
provide quarters for the one to four full-time apprentices (both male
and female) he's likely to have working with him at any one time.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON">4. Dairies</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">These three prosperous concerns each own a dozen or
more cows and graze them in these distinct pastures. The animals are
sheltered in neat, low-ceilinged barns. Each herd includes a
half-dozen calves; a great bull occupies his own pen on the Kalliwart
farm north of the stream.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The clans that run these dairies are friendly rivals,
striving to outdo each other in milk production--most of which is
bartered or sold to the cheese factory.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">4a. Kalliwart Farm, the largest of the three, is
managed by Glenvius and Blythi Kalliwart, who recently celebrated a
complete century of marriage. Ten children and their spouses,
twenty-two grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren make up the
rest of the household. The family is known for its slightly
rambunctious youngsters--they are charismatic and popular, but prone
to be troublemakers. The farm boasts twenty-two milk cows and the
village's only bull.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">4b. Bandawax Farm, with its fifteen cows, is tended by
a smaller clan with a reputation for thrift, even tightfistedness.
Gammer Bandawax is a venerable matriarch who keeps tight control over
the family purse strings. Her five daughters and their husbands,
together with fourteen grandchildren, live in a sprawling, multi-roomed
burrow.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">4c. Lily Hectare, the third farm, is where the
Jallisall family tends a herd of twelve cows. A trio of brothers, all
widowers, head the family, sharing the house with a dozen
descendants. The farm is most noted for the gorgeous flowerbeds that
surround not only the house but the barn and pasture as well.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON">5. Trading Stump</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The arched bridge descends from the mill into a small
grove of towering oaks. Among them is centered the hut of Filbert the
Trader. Before his ramshackle dwelling is a flat stump, more than
four feet in girth, where a tree struck by lightning was cut down.
Here, in the shade of the arching branches, the wily halfling
merchant sits and barters with his many customers.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Filbert Oldfur is a well-traveled halfling, a former
adventurer and a famous character in the village. His home sprawls
through several underground tunnels around his shop, and he shares
his burrow with seven nieces and nephews, and a vivacious
&quot;housekeeper&quot; named Milliciny. This attractive halfling
lass returned to the village with Filbert following one of his
travels and has been the source of considerable gossip and raised
eyebrows among the good citizens of Lindendale.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Filbert maintains a regular stock of the village's
major products, including Lindenbrook cheese, Amsterbock ale, and
Daleside red wine. He also offers samples of Dwilcath Batel's
woodcarvings, including well-turned cups and bowls.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The trader also keeps a number of goods of human,
dwarven, and elven make in stock, including metal pots, pans,
utensils, tools, arrowheads, and knives; salt, spices, tobacco;
wines, ales, and cheeses from surrounding villages; and an extensive
collection of fabrics, including wool, cotton, and even bolts of
bright silk.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON">6. Mayor's Mansion</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">This large burrow belongs to Fairweather Montajay,
Lindendale's esteemed mayor. An adventurer in her youth, she lived
for ten years in a large city not too far away. A first-class
Burglar, she eventually rose to become head of the local Thieves'
Guild before retiring and returning to her home town. Her clan is
numerous, including her husband Ashworthy (whom she met in the city
and brought back to Lindendale), five children and their spouses, and
fifteen grandchildren.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON">7. Sheriff Greenspan's Burrow</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The primary force for law and order in Lindendale is
this stocky warrior with graying hair and grizzled sideburns. He and
his wife live in this comfortable burrow, together with their six
children, two daughters-in-law, and their first grandchild (who is
perhaps a trifle spoiled).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The sheriff is a calm fellow who enjoys the comforts
of life, slow to respond in an emergency but level-headed and
dependable in a crisis. His chief secret in keeping the peace is to
always allow everybody to have his or her say before passing
judgment. Just downhill from the family home he and his sons have
constructed a small, partially buried shed. He uses this for storage,
but it can be securely barred on the outside if it's necessary to
lock someone up.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON">8. Carissa Candlemaker</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">The elderly Carissa is a widow famed for her stubborn
determination and unwillingness to compromise. She is kind-hearted
but cranky, unusually crotchety for a halfling. She lives her with
two sisters (also widowed) and a dozen children and grandchildren.
The burrow is surrounded by clover, as the family maintains a row of
beehives from which they harvest honey and wax. They barter with the
honey and use the wax to make fine candles which are prized
throughout the village.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON">9. Benden Sire, Locksmith</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">This halfling is something of a hermit. He is also the
wealthiest halfling in Lindendale, having made a fortune designing
the locks to protect an emperor's hoard that foiled the attempts by
heads of three thieves' guilds to pick them. His burrow is extensive
and mostly underground, with stout shutters over the windows and an iron-barred
door of heavy planks. Benden lives here alone, never having married
and being totally absorbed in the pursuit of his art; he spends
almost all his time working on his dream of creating a lock that
cannot be picked. To test his creations, he has amassed the finest
collection of lockpicks for many miles around.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON">10. Amster's Brewery</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">This hardworking family of seven brews the dark ale
called Amsterbock here. The business was started by a famous
ancestor, Alberti Amster; today, his granddaughter Jess carries on
the family tradition, added by several cousins. This beverage is one
of Lindendale's most popular products, allowing Jess and her cousins
to live quite comfortably, although rumor has it that she has
succumbed to the adventuring bug and may soon head out into the world
to seek her fortune.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON">11. Woodcarver's shop</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Dwilcath Batel is the premier woodcarver of
Lindendale, living in this burrow near the fringe of forest above the
town. He is a benign patriarch, still skilled with his knife, though
much of the heavier work (woodcutting and carpentry) is now done by
his four sons. They are all married, and three grandchildren live
here, with the fourth on the way.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON">12. Vintners</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Pally and Dorith Quettory are a cheerfully robust
couple, middle-aged and childless, who have devoted their energies to
the sweeping vineyards which cover the hillside below their front
door. Their primary vintage is called Daleside Red, though they make
a rarer Pale version that is also highly prized.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON">13. The Fletchery</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">This new burrow is inhabited by Wally and Sass Talbot,
a young couple who only recently married and got a home of their own;
they are now expecting their first child. Comfortable if not
ostentatious, it is crowded with arrows finished and unfinished
(Wally's handiwork) and Sass's latest bow. Sass only makes bows to
order, carefully crafting each one for the person who commissioned
it; so well made is her handiwork that the original owner receives a
+1 bonus to his or her chance to hit when using it.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON">14. Farms</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">These nine burrows range from modest to capacious and
are the home to the families of farmers who tend the fields
surrounding Lindendale: the Baldorfs, Byttnis, Dudleys, Heathertoes,
Newters, Ostgoods, Trills, Tucks, and Weatherbees.</FONT></P>
