 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The necromancer gains a slight resistance to all forms of magic. The wizard’s
base magic resistance is 10%, plus an additional 2% per level. Thus, a
20th-level necromancer with this ability would have a 50% magic resistance. 
<P></P>
 Note that this magic resistance operates continuously and cannot be
consciously controlled by the wizard. It does not, however, adversely affect the
necromancer’s ability to cast spells or employ magical items of any kind.
