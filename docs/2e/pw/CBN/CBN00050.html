 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The necromancer gains the ability to perceive radiations and auras beyond
normal human vision. At low levels (up to 5th level), the wizard can see normally
under the night sky. While indoors (in conditions of total darkness), the wizard
can still perceive objects normally, up to a range of 30 feet. This does not
hinder the wizard’s eyesight at all. 
<P></P>
 For every six levels of experience, the wizard gains another divinatory power
based on the wizard spell of the same name (the DM may roll a d8 or choose): 1) <I>detect magic</I>; 2) <I>detect invisibility</I>; 3) <I>detect good/evil</I>; 4) <I>know alignment</I>; 5) <I>wizard sight (TOM)</I>; 6) <I>infravision</I>; 7) <I>clairvoyance</I>; 8) <I>detect life (WH)</I>. 
<P></P>
 Except for night vision, these powers do not operate continuously. The
necromancer must visually concentrate on the subject (or area) for them to work. While
the enhanced vision is active, the wizard’s eyes light up with a malevolent,
reddish glow. Normally, it takes one full round to scan an object, person, or
area with the magical, enhanced vision.
