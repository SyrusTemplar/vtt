   <FONT SIZE="3">Perhaps the easiest way to unbalance an 
   NPC&#151;without modifying any of the basic rules of the campaign and 
   introducing the notion of lower-planar powers&#151;is for the DM to 
   assign dual-classed abilities to a particular character. In practice, 
   DMs rarely adopt this approach when creating NPCs because the process 
   can be quite time consuming. As we shall see, for the special case of 
   necromancer wizards, the creation of a dual class can be relatively easy.</FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="3">For simplicity, since the character&#146;s principal 
   profession is assumed to be necromancy, the DM must only worry about 
   determining the NPC&#146;s original profession. In other words, the 
   DM can suppose that NPC advanced in a primary career up to a certain 
   point and then abandoned that profession in favor of taking up the 
   vocation of necromancy. The DM&#146;s first task, then, is to 
   determine the necromancer&#146;s original profession. The obvious 
   obstacle to this approach involves ability score restrictions. 
   According to the <A HREF="../PHB/DD01514.html">PHB (page 45)</A>, the 
   character must have an Intelligence of 17 (a necromancer&#146;s prime 
   requisite) and a score of 15 in the prime attribute of the original 
   profession. The easiest way to select a potential first profession, 
   then, would be to inspect the necromancer&#146;s ability scores.</FONT></P>
