<P></P>

<P></P>
<B>Physical Appearance:</B> A short, pale woman in her late thirties, Ellandra has thin yellow hair and
hazel eyes, highlighted by long gold lashes. Ellandra’s hands are milk-white and
delicate, her fingers tipped by unusually long nails. When nervous, bored, or
anxious, she will clack her nails impatiently on the nearest available hard
surface. 
<P></P>
 Despite her natural beauty, Ellandra is insecure about her own appearance. She
favors long-sleeved robes cut in the exotic, southern style of Calimshan to
modestly conceal much of her body, and she keeps a black leather shoulder bag
nearby, which contains her surgical equipment and medications. 
<P></P>

<P></P>
<B>Background:</B> Ellandra was born into one of the noble houses of Neverwinter. Her father was
a famous Anatomist, and as a child she assisted him in his dissections. When
she was 13, a disgruntled serf burned the Tolbert Estate to the ground. Only
Ellandra survived, but her face was badly burned in the inferno. After that
disaster, she resolved to continue her father’s research, eventually joining the
Anatomical Academy. 
<P></P>
 At first, Ellandra focused her research on curing—or at least hiding—the
horrible burns on her face. She first developed <I>false face</I> for that purpose. As her power grew, she learned how to <I>graft flesh</I> from a cadaver onto her own scarred face, concealing her deformity. 
<P></P>
 Today she still maintains a <I>grafted</I> face, and her skill with the Art enables her to blend the <I>corpse flesh</I> with her own skin exactly. She continually fortifies this disguise with
multiple overlapping spells, so that it cannot be undone all at once by a single
lucky <I>dispel magic.</I> Ellandra has maintained this “disguise” for years. 
<P></P>
 Her former husband, Gerard Anterra, was a famous sea captain and privateer,
but he tragically died in action off Nelather more than five years ago. His body
was never recovered, and Ellandra was plunged into deep depression. After
Gerard's death, Ellandra devoted her life to the Academy. Ellandra now labors
exhaustively at her research, secretly trying to find a way to bring her husband
permanently back from the dead. 
<P></P>
 Her close friend and confidante, Mistress Yola (detailed in her own NPC
sheet), has recently cultivated a mild cruel streak in Ellandra. Even though Ellandra
does not follow her friend’s fanatical religious views, she still regards Yola
as a trusted ally. 
<P></P>

<P></P>
<B>Role-Playing Notes:</B> Ellandra carries herself with the hauteur of a true aristocrat. She is
fantastically wealthy and expects everyone around her to cater to her whims, if not
for her wit and beauty, then for her money. Ellandra is an accomplished surgeon,
but she only practices these skills on the living to show off or to endear
herself to potential allies. She really has little concern for healing—her
interest lies in dissecting and studying the dead body. 
<P></P>
 Despite her wealth and power, Ellandra is sad and lonely. She mentions her
dead husband Gerard in just about any conversation, and when she is especially
morbid, she dredges up memories of her father. Ellandra craves love and attention.
She adores flattery. 
<P></P>
 Despite her quirks and mood swings, Ellandra is more sad and tragic than
cold-heartedly evil. She can be extremely generous with those she is trying to
befriend. Ellandra would make an interesting patron for a party of adventurers. She
might even take a party mage under her wing, especially if he coincidentally
reminded her of Gerard.
