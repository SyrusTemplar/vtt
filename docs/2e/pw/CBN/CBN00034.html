 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This combination requires the character to have a 15 Str and 17 Int. Along
with the minimum 16 Wis of the necromancer, this combination can be hard to
generate using the standard character generation procedures from the <I>PHB</I>. Although fighter/necromancers cannot wear armor, they retain their original
fighter kit abilities, weapon proficiencies, excellent hit points, and THAC0.
The character retains the ability to use of all weapons and magical items
(including a <I>girdle of giant strength</I> and so on) that he or she enjoyed as a warrior. These benefits make the
character a much more difficult opponent in physical combat (quite handy for an
archvillain). 
<P></P>
 Of all the dual-classed characters, this is perhaps the easiest for the DM (or
another player) to effectively role-play and justify. Consider the case of
Talib the Magnificent, a 5th-level warrior/16th-level necromancer. Because of his
physical strength, the character embarked on a career as a warrior of the
desert until he encountered a mentor in the wilderness who recognized his “true
calling” as a necromancer. From then on, Talib devoted his life to the Art,
forsaking his earlier profession, except when it best served his purposes to appear
like a fighter. Early in his magical career, when his supply of spells was
frightfully limited, Talib’s specialization with the scimitar helped him in many
battles. 
<P></P>
 Except in special circumstances, a dual-classed character will generally not
have advanced to name (9th) level as a warrior before adapting necromancy. If
the character had attained fame and notoriety as a warrior, there would have been
little reason for him or her to switch professions! For simplicity, the DM may
determine the character’s level of experience as a fighter by rolling 2d4
(resulting in 2nd to 8th level).
