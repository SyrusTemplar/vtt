 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">After one visit to Sahu, a timid party of adventurers may want leave and never
return. This is only natural. Some would call such heroes intelligent or, at
the very least, discreet for cutting their losses so early. In fact, if the
adventurers are frightened of Sahu, you, as the DM, have been doing your job right!
Here are a few more strategies that you can use to lure a reluctant party of
heroes back to the island. Additionally, they can also serve as independent
adventure hooks for a background even distantly related to the tale of the
Necromancer Kings.
