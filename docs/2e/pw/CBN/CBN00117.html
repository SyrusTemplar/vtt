God of the Dead</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="1">
<P></P>

<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This god is the King of the Dead, the Guardian of the Afterlife, the Protector
of the Eternal Pilgrim. He is also the Patron of Travelers, since journeys and
quests in the world of the living are merely a preparation for the ultimate
voyage into the netherworld. Undead are an abomination to this deity, since they
represent a direct affront or rebellion against his divine authority. 
<P></P>
 The God of the Dead is chiefly responsible for keeping departed spirits
completely separated from the realm of the living. He must directly approve any <I>raise dead</I>, <I>resurrection</I>, or <I>reincarnation</I> spell in the campaign, even those cast by priests of other deities in the
same pantheon. Any time one of these spells is cast, there is a flat 25% chance
that a true neutral deity will cancel it (neutral evil deities will refuse such
requests 50% of the time). 
<P></P>
 Priests of this god are sometimes called Death Lords by members of their Order
(also “Pales” or “Deadeyes” among their detractors). They are charged with
maintaining the divinely ordained segregation between the Living and the Dead.
Those who thwart this natural order—specifically undead creatures or living people
who have cheated natural death too many times—will often be paid a cheerless
visit by these priests, who will seek to restore the divine balance. The
priesthood is also charged with sheltering travelers, guiding the lost, and assisting
questers, since these attributes are reflected in their deity and considered to
be a preparation for their role in the afterlife. 
<P></P>
 <B>Alignment:</B> The God of the Dead is either neutral or neutral evil. In societies where the
god serves as an impartial judge and ruler of the Dead (like the Egyptian god
Anubis), he will be true neutral. However, when the deity is revered as a cold
and pitiless guardian or incarcerator of the dead (such as the Greek god
Hades), he may be neutral evil. His priests must be neutral good, neutral, or neutral
evil, although the flock of worshippers may be of any alignment.
<P></P>
 <B>Minimum Ability Scores:</B> Wisdom 9, Charisma 12. 
<P></P>
 <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> As living ambassadors from the God of the Dead, Death Lords need to be able
to perform their sacred duties, which often include “retiring” those undead and
stubborn mortals who refuse to die. These specialty priests may thus employ a
wide range of weapons, including the battle axe, dagger/dirk, knife, scythe,
sickle, stiletto, staff, khopesh, scimitar, and short sword. 
<P></P>
 <B>Dress/Armor Allowed:</B> Normally, the priests wear only simple traveling clothes or shifts of white,
charcoal gray, brown, or black. On ceremonial occasions, the priests dress in
robes of purple or red (the colors of royalty), covering their faces and hands
with white chalk to make themselves appear like corpses. They may not employ any
form of armor or shield, though they can use protective magical items, such as <I>rings of protection</I>, provided that these items are unadorned. 
<P></P>
 <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Required: netherworld lore (this new wizard proficiency takes 1 slot only),
religion. Recommended: (General) etiquette, heraldry, singing; (Warrior) any;
(Priest) astrology, musical instrument, reading/writing, spellcraft; (Wizard)
necrology (this takes 1 slot only). Forbidden: all Rogue.
<P></P>
 <B>Role: </B>Death Lords live apart from civilization in secluded fortress-monasteries,
separated from the world of the living. There they pray and meditate for the dead,
occasionally emerging from their religious community (always in ceremonial
garb) to perform an urgent quest or mission for their divine overlord. These
assignments usually involve laying a troubled spirit (or perhaps an ancient wizard)
to rest. Depending upon the perceived reluctance (and power) of the individual,
anywhere from 1–6 red-robed priests may be dispatched on such a “retirement”
ritual. 
<P></P>
 As patrons of travelers, the priesthood might also provide shelter and
valuable information for a party during an adventure or quest. They can also perform
as mentors or guides on a journey into the netherworld, since they are
intimately acquainted with their deity’s residence in the Outer Planes (usually Hades).
The priesthood could thus serve as a springboard for extraplanar adventures.
<P></P>
 Sometimes, a lone priest will wander the world, seeking personal enlightenment
or on some other quest. This would provide a good excuse for an NPC Death Lord
to join the party for an adventure or two, until some important mission has
been resolved. It might also serve as good motivation for a PC Death Lord, should
the DM decide to make this kit available to players. 
<P></P>
 <B>Spheres of Influence:</B> Major Access to All, Astral, Necromantic, Divination, Protection, Travelers
(TOM). Minor Access to Sun (including reversed spells), Charm, Combat, Guardian,
Healing, and Summoning.
<P></P>
 <B>Granted Necromantic Spells:</B> 1st:<I> invisibility to undead</I>; 2nd: <I>aid</I>; 3rd: <I>death’s door</I>, <I>feign death</I>, <I>negative plane protection</I>, <I>speak with dead</I>, <I>spirit bind/spirit release</I>; 4th: none; 5th: <I>dispel good/dispel evil, slay living/raise dead, drain undead</I>; 6th: None; 7th: <I>destruction/resurrection</I>; Quest: none. 
<P></P>
 All Death Lords have access to spells with power over life and death. Priests
of neutral good alignment will only employ the deadly versions of these spells
when on an official “retirement” mission. 
<P></P>
 <B>Granted Powers:</B> Death Lords have a powerful ability to turn undead (even priests of evil
alignment will attempt to destroy undead rather than control them). These priests
always affect undead as if they were three levels higher in ability (thus a
5th-level Death Lord turns undead as an 8th-level priest). 
<P></P>
 Upon reaching 5th level, the priest may employ a heightened version of speak
with dead. With this ability, the priest need only know the name of the deceased
in order to summon the spirit, regardless of its time spent in the
netherworld. The shade is not entitled to a saving throw to resist interrogation, and it
must answer up to six questions truthfully. 
<P></P>
 Finally, at 12th level, all attempts to raise dead are automatically granted
by the deity. 
<P></P>
 Other Limitations: All Death Lords must adopt a Spartan, almost monastic
lifestyle. Not only does this way of life prepare them for the coming existence in
the afterlife, but it also serves as an example for faithful followers. Since
the dead have no need for wealth, the priests never retain personal treasure,
either donating the money to their temple or distributing it among members of
their flock. Although the priests can own personal possessions and magical items,
these objects must have a plain appearance. 
<P></P>
 Normally, the priests may only eat simply prepared food (the blander, the
better) to remind them of the drab fare in the netherworld. During holy seasons,
they must subsist on a diet of flavorless food (such as rice). In addition, the
priests must spend at least one day of the week in utter seclusion and
meditation, completely abstaining from all food, water, and contact with other living
creatures. 
<P></P>
 These priests may never marry. Upon reaching 5th level, they must also remain
completely celibate. 
<P></P>
<B> Possible Symbols:</B> Gates, Gravestone, Tomb, Path, Road, White Hand, Pale Face.
