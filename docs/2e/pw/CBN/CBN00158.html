 Sahu is not completely bereft of civilization. Two villages, Misbahd and
Jinutt, can be found on the island’s northern shore, at the base of the giant
plateau. These settlements can be used as the starting point for most adventures,
since the party will presumably have arrived at one of these ports by ship.
Misbahd is a dilapidated and squalid den of rogues and pirates. The settlement is
well fortified, protected by a small fleet of “privateers,” and its shops and
stores are filled with all types of merchandise, illicit and otherwise. Jinutt, on
the other hand, is a small, simple village of fishermen who provide food to
Misbahd in exchange for various necessities. 
<P></P>
 Despite the villages’ serene or mundane appearance, there is something
peculiar about them which should only be learned after several visits in which the PCs
have become sufficiently familiar with the locals and village leaders.
Eventually, the party members will notice that there are a few shrines to mainland
gods, but there is no large temple or priesthood in either Misbahd or Jinutt.
There are no healers or priests capable of raising the dead on Sahu. Neither is
there a cemetery. When people die (which happens quite frequently in rough
Misbahd), their bodies are carried in a funeral procession out to the edge of town,
where they are abandoned to “the wild forces of nature,” presumably to be
devoured by wild animals. This ancient tradition is very sacred to the villagers, and
it applies to everyone on the island—both natives and visitors. To break with
this holy rite would anger the evil spirits of the highlands, who would punish
the offending village. Those attempting to interfere or stop a funeral
procession will be quickly confronted by a hysterical and violent mob. 
<P></P>
 Although they would never admit it to any visitor, many of the villagers are
secret worshippers of the ancient god Thasmudyan and are fanatical members of
the highly secret Cult of Worms. The entire ruling hierarchy in both villages is
made up entirely by cultists who are sworn to absolute secrecy. The bodies of
the dead are actually carried away by a pack of ghouls (disguised as plum-robed
priests) to a nearby underground temple where the corpses are ritually devoured
by the ghouls and a small hierarchy of death priests (Charnelists) whom the
PCs may recognize as members of the village council. Each temple has a black
stone idol of Thasmudyan and a small treasury which may contain a few magical items
of minor importance. Obviously, important magical items are wielded by the
priests and ghouls themselves.
<P></P>
 Finally, these villages are also ideal locations to learn various rumors and
lore about the island. In general, the superstitious villagers (island natives)
consider the upper plateau to be haunted, a forbidden, dangerous place of
ghosts and evil spirits. A few retired adventurers in the villages have more
information. With suitable monetary encouragement, they reveal the location of “ruins
along the shore of the sea” (Ereshkigal) supposedly containing fabulous
treasures and magical items, virtually unguarded.
