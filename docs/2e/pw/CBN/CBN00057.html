 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This ability enables the necromancer to see or hear activity through any skull
or cadaveric head. The skull or head must not be attached to a spine, nor can
it be animated. The necromancer can scry through any disembodied skull or head
(at a known location) that is up to one mile away per point of the wizard’s
Intelligence. In some cases, other types of sensory links may be used with the
skull scry ability. The DM should refer to the spells <I>spectral voice</I> and <I>corpse link</I> in Chapter Four for further inspiration.
