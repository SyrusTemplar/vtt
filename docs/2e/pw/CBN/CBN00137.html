<P></P>
 This nasty spell causes a major disease and weakness in victims who fail a
saving throw vs. spells at a –3 penalty. Afflicted individuals are immediately
stricken with a sickening <I>scourge</I> that quickly spreads to cover their entire bodies. The blackened boils,
magenta blotches, violet lesions, seeping abscesses, and malignant cysts are
excruciatingly painful, and highly debilitating. 
<P></P>
 In the short term, the Strength, Dexterity, and Charisma of each victim are
reduced by 3. Attack rolls are similarly decreased by 3. The agonizing symptoms
persist until a victim receives a <I>cure disease, heal,</I> or <I>restoration</I> spell bestowed by a more powerful priest than the original caster. <I>Dispel magic</I> and remove curse are powerless to mediate the symptoms of a scourge, but a
wish will eradicate the infection immediately. 
<P></P>
 A <I>scourge</I> may also lead to a long-term, debilitating illness. Those ignoring the
malignant disease resulting from the spell’s effects for more than a few days may be
susceptible to much worse afflictions (such as gangrene, plague, or leprosy)
that ultimately result in the victim’s untimely death within 1–4 weeks. 
<P></P>
 Furthermore, if a victim of the spell enters an area of dense population,
there is always a chance that the disease may spread (1% per caster level) into an
epidemic of massive proportions. These long-term effects of the scourge are
left to the discretion of the DM. 
<P></P>
 The material component is a specially prepared, black whip or riding crop,
which is cracked in the direction of the intended victims during the casting of
the spell. Because of its horrific affect, <I>scourge</I> is typically only granted to high priests of a malignant and evil god who is
dedicated to spreading death and disease.
