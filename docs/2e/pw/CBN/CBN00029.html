 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">With this proficiency, a character learns about the cosmology and organization
of the AD&amp;D® game multiverse, focusing primarily on the ultimate destination
of spirits after death: the Outer Planes. In addition, the character learns
about the behavior of the dangerous creatures that inhabit the nether regions,
including such fiends as the tanar’ri and the baatezu. As with necrology (which
applies exclusively to undead), netherworld knowledge can reveal the specific
weaknesses and natural immunities of beings from the Outer Planes. The proficiency
can also be used to classify the exact type of extraplanar creature
encountered. Both of these abilities require an ability check, however.
