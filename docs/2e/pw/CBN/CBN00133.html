 This spell drives a victim insane. The DM may consult the madness table in
Chapter Three or choose a form of insanity to suit the wicked caster. A death
priest, for instance, might inflict a victim with an exaggerated fear of dying
(requiring the character to make a saving throw vs. paralyzation to avoid the
effects of a <I>fear</I> spell whenever he or she encounters a cadaver, human bones, a graveyard, or
even an open coffin). Alternatively, the victim might become convinced that all
corpses were undead, waiting to rip him or her to shreds. In a combat
situation, a death priest will probably choose to quickly neutralize an opponent with an
incapacitating form of insanity, such as <I>confusion</I> or <I>feeblemindedness</I>. The insanity is permanent and cannot be dispelled except by casting <I>cure insanity</I> (the reverse), <I>heal, restoration</I>, or <I>wish.</I> 
<P></P>
 The reverse of this spell immediately cures insanity due to most causes (no
saving throw). The spell must be administered while the patient is exhibiting
insane symptoms. <I>Cure insanity</I> can heal a conscious victim of the effects of hallucinatory spores and repair
psychic trauma (resulting from a mindwipe or other psionic assault). The spell
also diminishes psychic exhaustion (restoring 5–40 PSPs). It cures madness
resulting from spells (such as <I>confusion, chaos, contact other plane, feeblemind, symbol of insanity,</I> and <I>prismatic spray, wall,</I> or <I>sphere</I>) and also heals the insanity caused by certain magical items (such as an
elixir of madness or a scarab of insanity). However, the spell will not control
aberrant behaviors caused by lycanthropy, undeath, or powerful curses (such as a <I>geas</I> or <I>quest</I>). Finally, at the DM’s discretion, <I>cure insanity</I> may temporarily calm the demented behavior of certain extraplanar creatures
(such as slaad).
