 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This magical ability enables the necromancer to adopt a chosen animal form as
if transformed by the wizard spell <I>polymorph self</I>. The chosen animal, bird, or fish must either be a natural predator or
otherwise associated with death. Examples include the cheetah, bat, panther, wolf,
vulture, tiger, bear, rat, shark, barracuda, killer whale, raven, or falcon. For
every six levels of experience, the wizard can adopt one chosen animal form
into which he or she can polymorph up to three times per day. The transformation
occurs in a single round and includes all of the wizard’s carried or worn
possessions.
