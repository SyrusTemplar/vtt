 In the hands of a novice spell-caster, this spell instantaneously snuffs out
the life forces of small rodents and vermin in the area of effect, including
such normal pests as flies, mice, beetles, rats, spiders, and the like. Only
creatures with 1–3 hp per level of the caster (9 hp maximum) and animal intelligence
can be <I>exterminated</I>. More powerful wizards can thus affect bigger pests, including large spiders,
stirges, poisonous snakes, and giant or huge centipedes. If the targeted
creatures are extremely small (1 hp or less), then an area up to 1 cubic foot per
level (10 cubic feet maximum) can be cleansed of pests. 
<P></P>
 This spell is well-suited to indoor or outdoor applications and is a favorite
among necromancers who live among pestilence. Occasionally, cruel mages have
been known to <I>exterminate </I>benign animals (and sometimes even others’ pets) with the spell. The somatic
gesture is a pointed finger, while the caster verbalizes a low <I>zzzt</I> sound. The material components are a pinch of lavender and dried garlic.
