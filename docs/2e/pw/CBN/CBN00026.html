 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The following new nonweapon proficiencies are suitable for use by NPC
necromancers (and death priests) in the campaign. At the DM’s discretion, these skills
also may be made available to player characters, providing they find an
appropriate tutor (a necromancer or death priest) willing to teach them. Open
possessors of these skills are viewed with considerable alarm by mainstream society,
which normally regards such knowledge as unspeakable or taboo.
