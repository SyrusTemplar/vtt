 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This power enables the necromancer to command undead like an evil priest with
half as many levels of experience. Thus an 18th-level necromancer controls
undead as a 9th-level priest. Certain necromancer kits and some necromantic
priesthoods already have authority over undead (the DM should choose another salient
ability for such characters).
