 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">With this proficiency, a character learns how to safely use both magical and
mundane poisons. There is no danger of such a character accidentally stabbing
someone with a poisoned weapon. Also, the character can identify a poison and a
possible antidote by visual inspection of the venom or its symptoms in a victim
(with an ability check). In addition, a character can identify naturally
occurring animals, plants, or monsters that are poisonous (with an ability check).
Any roll which fails by 4 or more results in a misidentification of both the
poison and its antidote. 
<P></P>
 At the DM’s discretion, characters with also the animal handling, herbalism,
and brewing nonweapon proficiencies may be able to manufacture some of the more
deadly poisons listed on page 73 of the <I>DMG</I>. The cost and time required for such an activity should be adjudicated by the
DM, but providing all of the components are personally harvested by the
character, it should take no less than 1–6 days to make one dose of poison. Magical
poisons cannot be manufactured using this ability.</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="1">
