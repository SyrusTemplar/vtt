 The <I>Nycoptic Manuscripts</I> foretold many plagues and portents, but none are more terrible than the
Opening, when the Ninth Seal in the Garden of Eternity will be broken, releasing
Vermissa from her magical prison. The first portent of her release, alluded to in
the <I>Manuscripts</I>, is the spread of disease across the land as the “cold breath of Thasmudyan
heralds the return of His chosen.” 
<P></P>
 Rampant plague is an excellent backdrop for a campaign of necromancers and
death priests. It should descend on a setting slowly, with vague rumors of
unexplained deaths filtering to the adventurers before the massive epidemic breaks
out, slaying as much as a third of the local population. This plague is at least
partly magical in nature, since clerical magic is much less effective against
it. <I>Cure disease </I>has only a 50% chance of success (the spell only works once per victim), and
only <I>heal</I> is 100% effective in eradicating the infection. 
<P></P>
  Before long, the Brotherhood of Sorrow arrives, and the Flagellants try their
best to mediate the local pain and suffering. One of the Master Flagellants
approaches the heroes, asking their help to stop the disease. The learned priest
has heard of the <I>Nycoptic Manuscripts</I>, which describe magical plagues of this sort and might contain suggestions of
a cure. He begs the party sail to Sahu and search for a copy, which may
greatly help alleviate the suffering.
<P></P>
 The prophetic manuscripts can indeed be found in Sahu, either in the Colossus
of Uruk or perhaps in the Tower of Pizentios (or the Garden of Eternity
itself). A perusal of the scroll does reveal a cure for the disease (eating one raw
scarab beetle a day), but it also suggests the cause of the plague: “the release
of Thasmudyan’s chosen.” (Vermissa is not named specifically). 
<P></P>
 There are two other prophesies in the manuscripts that are directly related to
Vermissa: “The Sundered Man shall be made whole by the Chosen, who will
release Her” (this refers to the restoration of Nebt Bhakau, mentioned previously)
and “The Chosen shall Emerge when the Colossus walks in Nycopolis” (this can be
taken to mean that the Colossus of Uruk will come to life in some way, but it
really alludes to the fact that Bhakau and Pizentios, working together, will
create a huge, flesh golem (a Colossus of sorts) and use the monster to physically
destroy Vermissa’s prison). All of this will happen exactly as was predicted,
unless, of course, the necromancers’ evil plans are thwarted by the intrepid
adventurers after they bring back the knowledge of how to cure the plague!
