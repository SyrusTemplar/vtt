 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The necromancer can withstand greater amounts of physical damage than a
regular, mortal wizard. The wizard gains +1 hp per level of experience (in addition
to any bonuses due to high constitution). Furthermore, the character does not
lose consciousness or perish when reduced to zero hit points. The necromancer can
remain conscious and functional (even in combat) until reduced to –10 hp,
similar to the 3rd-level spell <I>delay death (WH).</I>
