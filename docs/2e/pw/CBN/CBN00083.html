 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Since the necromancer might be playing an important, long-term role in a
campaign, it is paramount that the DM determine not only what spells the wizard
might have memorized for a specific encounter, but also define a comprehensive list
that includes all spells to which the caster has access. The Undead Master on
holiday at the cemetery will undoubtedly have a different set of spells at his
or her disposal than the reclusive Philosopher, lounging in a study. 
<P></P>
 Choosing spells for any spell caster—especially a powerful one—can be an
challenging and time-consuming task for DM and player alike. An 18th-level
sorceress, for instance, has over 40 spells at her disposal! Are all her 3rd-level
spells going to be <I>vampiric touch</I>? Unlikely! She will choose a wide variety of spells that are appropriate to
her kit and alignment. As detailed in Chapter One, each kit is specialized in a
different aspect of necromantic spellcraft. 
<P></P>
 A wizard’s alignment generally has the biggest effect on his or her spell
selection. While not all necromancy is inherently evil, it carries a strong social
stigma because of its great potential for inflicting pain, suffering, and harm
on both the living and the dead (or even the undead). A wicked NPC will
probably have no compunction about employing “criminal” or “black” necromancy.
However, once the heroic characters in your campaign have defeated this nemesis, they
will undoubtedly uncover his grimoire and gain access to the villain’s
repertoire of spells. 
<P></P>
 Even good-hearted PCs may be tempted to use the forbidden lore, considering
that many necromantic spells can be quite powerful, especially at high levels. Is
a spell inherently evil, or is it simply that it can be put to evil use? This
is a question many heroes will have to struggle with. This ambivalence and
uncertainty should be encouraged, since temptation and moral quandaries make for
excellent role-playing. However, as explained in Chapter Three, the use of
criminal necromancy carries grave dangers for the caster, whether villain or player
character. While the consequences for employing black necromancy must always be
kept vague and nebulous for the players, the DM needs to have a clear
definition and justification of the term.
