 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The necromancer can surround him- or herself with an aura of fear similar to
(though less powerful than) that of a lich. Any creature with fewer than 3 HD
(or levels of experience) who views this palpable, black aura must make a saving
throw vs. spells or flee in terror for 2–12 rounds. Creatures with more than 4
HD are entitled to a +4 bonus and only flee for 1–6 rounds if they fail the
save. Beings of equal or greater hit dice than the necromancer are unaffected.
Unlike the regular<I> fear</I> spell, this necromantic aura has a more gradual and numbing effect. Affected
creatures are thus unlikely to drop carried items.
