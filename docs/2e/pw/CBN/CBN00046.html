 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The necromancer is able to memorize double the amount of normally available,
low-level spells. For every six levels of experience, the necromancer gains
augmented abilities for a new spell level (starting with 1st-level spells). Thus a
6th-level necromancer can memorize twice as many 1st-level spells. At 12th
level, the wizard gains double 1st and 2nd-level spells. At 18th level, double 1st
to 3rd-level spells, and so on. These extra spells must be chosen from the
school of Necromancy.
