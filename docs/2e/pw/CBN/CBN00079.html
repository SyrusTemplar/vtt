 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Curses are a fourth handicap which may be imposed on a necromancer by a patron
god as a compensating punishment for some Dark Gift. The curse usually
manifests as some form of uncontrollable compulsion (such as howling at a full moon).
Others affect the necromancer’s behavior (such as never being able to speak the
truth). A final class of curses makes the wizard susceptible to a special
attack form (like holy water). The handicaps listed in <A HREF="CBN00077.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="CBN00077.html">Table 8</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> may also result from willingly dabbling in black necromancy or using
necromantic (and cursed) magical items. 
<P></P>
 The recipient is usually well aware of the nature of his or her compulsion,
but as with a geas or quest, the subject is unable to take any measures that
would remove it. Instead, the wizard may try to compensate for the weakness with
appropriate precautions. For instance, a wizard who was susceptible to weapons
hewn from freshly cut holly might destroy all trees near his or her lair. 
<P></P>
 Only a <I>remove curse</I> (employed by a higher-level caster than the victim) or a <I>wish</I> can eliminate an unholy compulsion.
