 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The necromancer is able to regenerate two hit points per round. This ability
continues to operate regardless of circumstances. Severed limbs continue to
twitch and move under the wizard’s direction, and they immediately reattach if
brought into contact with the body (similar to a troll’s powers). The wizard’s body
continues to regenerate after death, even if the remains were destroyed and
reduced by fire or acid. If the body is dismembered and the parts buried
separately, it will take the necromancer one month to regenerate completely for every
100 feet distance of separation between the various parts. Alternatively, if the
body is burned or dissolved in acid, the remains may be scattered over a wide
area, delaying the regeneration time by one month for every 10-foot-square
region of disposal area.

 Necromancers with such regenerative powers can be terribly difficult to kill
permanently. The DM may care to devise a special ritual (or a minor adventure)
which must be completed in order for the wizard’s death to be final. For
instance, a certain necromancer’s remains might need to be dissolved in aqua regia and
then cast into the Lake of Winter Spirits during an annual solstice. Another
wizard might keep his life force safe in a receptacle or phylactery which must
be destroyed before the necromancer can be killed. Certainly the rite of final
destruction will vary from necromancer to necromancer and must be adjudicated by
the DM.
