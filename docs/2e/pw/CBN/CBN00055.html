   <FONT SIZE="3">With the touch of a bare hand, the necromancer can 
   infect a victim with a deadly disease (see Chapter Three for notes on 
   the plague and leprosy, or the description for </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="../PHB/DD02178.html">cure
    disease</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> in the<I> PHB</I>). 
   Alternatively, the necromancer&#146;s touch may inflict mummy rot or 
   a permanent version of <I>contagion</I>. The DM must decide on the 
   single effect of a scabrous touch.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">This power operates continuously and cannot be 
   controlled (ordinarily, the wizard will wear a glove over the deadly 
   hand to protect those nearby). The first symptoms of the disease 
   appear 1&#150;10 rounds after physical contact occurs with the 
   wizard&#146;s deadly hand, though it may take weeks (or, in the case 
   of leprosy, much longer) for the disease to run its full course. This 
   magical disease may only be cured by a wizard, priest, or paladin of 
   higher level than the necromancer.</FONT></P>
