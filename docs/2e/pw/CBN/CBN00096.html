 By casting this spell, a wizard animates a pair of skeletal hands that
levitate in midair and move as directed by the caster, who uses verbal commands and
somatic gestures to guide them. The hands can perform only simple grasping,
lifting, and carrying activities. They cannot perform complex movements that require
great dexterity, such as picking locks. They can, however, open unlocked doors
and chests, or turn pages in a spell book. The hands can also make two clawing
attacks per round, each attack directed against a different target. They
attack using the wizard’s table at the same level as the spellcaster, and each
inflicts 1–3 hp damage on a successful hit. The hands may be physically attacked in
turn (each hand has AC 5, hp 4, and MV 6) and may move anywhere within their
range.
<P></P>
 The hands can carry up to 5 pounds each; together, they can carry an object of
up to 20 pounds. The hands may wield weapons within these weight limits. When
using weapons, the skeletal hands attack on the wizard’s combat table, with a
level half that of the spellcaster and with applicable penalties for
nonproficiency. Hand-held melee weapons do half their normal damage (round up fractions),
because the hands cannot generate the proper forces that the weapons need in
order to inflict normal damage. The hands may fire an already loaded crossbow and
inflict normal damage, because the crossbow provides the necessary force to
propel the bolt. All other missile weapons have their ranges reduced to one
quarter and inflict their normal damage (round up fractions). 
<P></P>
 The material components are the complete, skeletal hands of any human,
demihuman, or humanoid. These hand bones may be reused in multiple castings of the
spell, providing the hands have not been damaged or destroyed in combat.
