   <FONT SIZE="3">Not all wizards can become necromancers. Masters of 
   the Dark Art must possess utmost self-control and mental stability in 
   order to successfully control the powerful energies at their 
   disposal. Frequent trafficking with the spirits of the dead and more 
   powerful creatures from the Lower Planes can exact a terrible price 
   on the sanity of these mages; weak-willed individuals have little 
   chance of emerging from such encounters with their mental faculties 
   unimpaired. As we shall see in Chapter Three, </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="CBN00078.html">insanity
    and madness</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> are of paramount 
   concern, even for the most wise and experienced practitioners of the 
   Dark Art.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">Consequently, only wizards with a minimum Wisdom of 16 
   may specialize in necromancy. As with most mages, they must also have 
   a minimum Intelligence of 9 (their prime requisite). The 
   character&#146;s ability scores may be determined by one of the </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01422.html">six
    methods</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> outlined in the PHB (page 
   13), though not all procedures are equally likely to generate a 
   character with the requisite high wisdom and intelligence. Methods I 
   and III are least likely to generate a necromancer character (roughly 
   a 2&#150;4% chance, based on random generations of 1000 or more sets 
   of ability scores). The chances improve somewhat for Methods II, IV, 
   and V (roughly 8%, 11%, and 15% chance, respectively). Only Method VI 
   offers about 90&#150;100% certainty.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">There are a few different strategies that the DM can 
   use when generating ability scores for an NPC. The quickest method is 
   for the DM to simply make up the ability scores. The DM can also roll 
   up the scores using the same method chosen for the adventurers in the 
   campaign. These approaches are best-suited for low-level henchmen, 
   hirelings, or other individuals of minor importance in the long-term campaign.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">However, if a necromancer is going to have a pivotal 
   role during an extended series of adventures, the DM may want to 
   tailor the ability scores to properly complement or challenge the 
   party of player characters. In a heroic campaign, where the 
   adventurers themselves have unusually high ability scores, should not 
   their archnemesis be similarly endowed? One might argue that the 
   party&#146;s archnemesis should have superior ability scores in most 
   respects to those of the typical PC. Where is the challenge in 
   fighting a weak enemy? The party will derive a much greater sense of 
   accomplishment in triumphing over a superior foe than an inferior one.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">Given the &#147;superior nemesis makes for better 
   gaming&#148; theory, the DM may use the following alternative dice-rolling
    methods to generate ability scores for necromancer wizards (in 
   addition to Methods I-VI of the PHB):</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><I>Method VII</I>: This method is a quick way to 
   generate standard statistics for an NPC. Each ability score starts 
   with 10, modified by the roll of 1d8 (each score thus varies from 11 
   to 18, with an average ability score around 14&#150;15). The DM can 
   speedily generate six ability scores and rearrange them to best 
   compliment the particular character. This method insures about a 75% 
   chance for randomly generating a necromancer NPC.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><I>Method VIII</I>: As Method VII, except give the 
   necromancer a +1 bonus on Intelligence and +1 bonus on Wisdom (18 
   maximum in each score). With these bonuses, the probability increases 
   to roughly the same as Method VI (90&#150;100%).</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">To avoid overbalancing the campaign with countless 
   &#147;super villains,&#148; the DM should use these last two methods 
   sparingly and only for NPCs (player characters should be restricted 
   to Methods I-VI). For most &#147;average&#148; NPC wizards, the DM 
   should simply make up the scores or use Methods I-VI from the </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="CBN00008.html">PHB</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">.
    Examples of ability scores generated using each of these methods are 
   presented in </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="CBN00012.html">Table
    1</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> (on page 10). The DM is 
   encouraged to use these pregenerated sets to expedite character 
   creation, either by choosing or random die roll (d6). This table may 
   also be used for random player character generation, though only with 
   the DM&#146;s permission (the DM should choose the appropriate Method 
   (I-VI) for the campaign).</FONT></P>
