   <FONT SIZE="3">Humanoid cultures, such as the orcs, bugbears, gnolls, 
   hobgoblins, and goblins, embrace violence and death, surpassing even 
   humans in this respect. Their societies are usually organized along 
   tribal lines, with the clan chief ruling as the undisputed leader in 
   temporal affairs. The clan priest or shaman takes care of the 
   tribe&#146;s spiritual matters.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">Finally, the tribal wizard (a member of the <A HREF="../CWH/DD06132.html">Savage
    Wizard kit</A> from the<I> WH</I>) oversees the purely magical 
   rituals and protections for the tribe. In most cases, the role of the 
   shaman conflicts with that of the witch doctor, since at low levels 
   the powers of a wizard can hardly compare with those of a priest. 
   Indeed, few humanoid races have much talent for wizardry, making the 
   witch doctor&#146;s role almost superfluous unless the shaman is absent.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">Many of the humanoid races are widely known to have 
   witch doctors as permanent members of a tribal community. Witch 
   doctors almost never rise above the 4th level of experience, but rare 
   individuals capable of casting 3rd-level spells have been reported in 
   the more heavily populated humanoid areas, like the Sword Coast in 
   the Realms.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">As noted earlier, the odds of randomly generating a 
   human necromancer with the requisite ability scores are at least 2%. 
   Among orcs, this probability would be even lower. According to the <I>Monstrous
    Manual</I>, the odds of encountering an orcish witch doctor (let 
   alone a <I>necromancer</I> witch doctor) are 5 in 1000! Except in a 
   major orcish city, the likelihood of encountering an orcish 
   necromancer is small indeed.</FONT></P>
