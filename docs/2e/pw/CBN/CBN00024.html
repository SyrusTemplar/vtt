 The Witch specializes in communicating with the dead. Because of the wizard’s
contact with invisible spirits, he or she learns many hidden secrets of about
the physical world. In a campaign, the Witch (also known as a Medium or Spirit
Channeler) can serve as both a beneficial ally or as a frightening nemesis. 
<P></P>
 This is an interesting and distinctive kit for a necromancer. Spells are
taught to the Witch by spirits rather than by a living mentor or by reading a book
of spells. The Witch is basically an envoy or intermediary between the living
and the dead, serving the needs of both groups. Unlike the Deathslayer, who may
seek to lay undead spirits to rest, the Witch has no such obsession (unless, of
course, a spirit either threatens her personally or asks for assistance). 
<P></P>
 In many ancient societies, consultation of the dead (through a witch or
medium) was a common practice. The Greek and Celtic equivalents, usually male, would
wrap themselves in the freshly skinned pelt of a magical animal (that of a lamb
in Greek society or that of a bull among the Celts) and seek the counsel of
spirits in the lonely places of the wilderness, usually on mountain tops or by
waterfalls. 
<P></P>
 In Roman times, the witch served as a diviner for the community (like the
witch of Endor from the Old Testament). During the Middle Ages, the witch gained a
negative and evil stereotype, living on the fringes of society like an outcast
for consorting with dark spirits (consider the three witches from <I>Macbeth</I>). Since their profession conflicted directly with one of the chief purposes
of the official or mainstream priesthood, witches were outlawed in almost every
period since the height of the Roman Empire.
<P></P>
 With these widely variant historical interpretations of the witch, the DM
should have plenty of ideas for incorporating such a character into the campaign.
