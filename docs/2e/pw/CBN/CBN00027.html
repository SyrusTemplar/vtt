</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This proficiency involves the knowledge of the secret mysteries and
intricacies of the human body, including the structure, function, and location of bones,
muscles, organs, and other soft tissues. This skill provides the scholarly
foundation for the Anatomist’s special abilities. This proficiency also comes in
handy with certain necromantic spells (such as <I>corpse link, spectral voice</I>, and <I>graft flesh</I>), which require fresh body parts that have been carefully harvested from
cadavers. 
<P></P>
 This proficiency also has some less gruesome benefits. A detailed knowledge of
anatomy can help with both the treatment of disease and the accurate artistic
representation of the human body. Characters with the anatomy nonweapon
proficiency automatically increase their skill with healing and artistic ability
proficiencies (+2 bonus to both ability checks).
