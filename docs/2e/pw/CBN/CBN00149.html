 This far-flung organization consists primarily of death priests who are
dedicated to the god of Pestilence. Its membership is also open to necromancers
(usually members of the Archetype kit). Although nominally dedicated to the
unravelling of governments, their true purpose is the complete and utter destruction of
all civilization. They are necromantic nihilists who want to bring disease and
death to every village, town, city, and kingdom in society. 
<P></P>
 When a small chapter house secretly opens in a community, its priests and
spies first collect as much information as possible about the new location. Then
they will then begin an ever-widening campaign of destruction in the town, sowing
as much discord as possible in the process, to keep their presence
camouflaged. They defoliate fertile pastures, poison livestock, pour pestilent potions
into communal wells, and spread gold coins marked with <I>plague curses</I>. The Scabrous Society leaves only deserted ghost towns in their wake,
stripped of all their valuables. The chapter house then moves on to a new location and
repeats the cycle of destruction. 
<P></P>
 Leaders of each chapter house communicate regularly with their superiors to
report their progress, receive advice, and take new orders. They are
well-organized and respond quite violently against those who thwart their plans.
Retribution squads, armed with <I>deathdust</I>-envenomed weapons, <I>arrows of harming</I>, and <I>plague bolts</I> (see Chapter Eight for more on these) will quickly make an example of any
foolishly heroic opposition.
