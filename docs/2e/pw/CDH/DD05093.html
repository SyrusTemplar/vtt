<P></P>
 Druid characters can use the magical items generally permitted priests except
written ones, such as scrolls or books. They can wear magical armor only when
it is natural, such as wooden shields. Any magical weapon a druid uses must be
of a type permitted to priests, as well as by the character's druidic kit and
branch.
<P></P>
 This section contains new magical items that fit the druid's role of Nature
priest, keeper of the balance, and dweller in the country. In addition, a small
number of the items are designed for use against druids.
<P></P>
 Although this listing contains some powerful items, many are fairly low-key.
Items like the <I>bountiful spade</I>, or<I> seeds of plenty</I> represent the kind of magical item a high-level character would create as a
gift for a favored farmer or lord. Druids might offer cursed items like the <I>necklace of beast speech</I> to someone as punishment for wronging the Order or the land.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Creating Magical Items
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> 
<P></P>
 The normal rules for priests creating magical items (<A HREF="../DMG/DD00525.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../DMG/DD00525.html">DMG pgs. 83-88</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">) apply to druids as well. In almost all cases, gathering the rare, unique, or
impossible components and combining them properly remains more important than
purchasing expensive materials; quest and ritual take precedence over the depth
of the druid's purse.
<P></P>
 The personal touch is vital: Druids must make the vessels for enchantment
using their nonweapon proficiencies. Characters needn't be expert artisans, but
they cannot create a magical scimitar merely by enchanting a weapon someone else
has made. As a result, a druid who completes an arduous series of tasks to
collect the necessary components may not actually have to spend any money to build
the item, although major magical items require components easily worth the 1,000
to 10,000 gp noted in the <I>DMG</I> (<A HREF="../DMG/DD00530.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../DMG/DD00530.html">p. 87</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">).
<P></P>
 Priest characters must spend up to three weeks meditating, fasting, and
purifying themselves before they can enchant an item. Druids must begin this process
at a sacred time, like an equinox, for the enchantment to have any chance of
success. Druids purify the vessel and pray for its consecration not at an altar,
but at their grove.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Potions
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> 
<P></P>
 <B>Potion of Plant Health.</B> This potion vitalizes a living plant when poured upon its roots. It cures the
plant's illnesses and keeps it free from natural parasites and disease for a
year. During this time, the plant grows 50% better than normal, and 10% better
than normal the next year. Edible fruit, berries, or sap from the plant taste
unusually succulent, while flowering plants bloom exceptionally well. If a
vegetable monster such as a treant or shambling mound drinks this potion, treat it as
a <I>potion of extra-healing.</I> XP value: 400.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <B>Sap of the Eldest Tree.</B> Usually found in an earthen flask, this potion resembles thick corn or maple
syrup. Characters who drink the sap (or bake it in a cake and eat it) will not
age a day for the next 10 years! However, unlike a <I>longevity</I> potion, it does not make the drinker any younger. A person must consume the
entire potion to gain the full benefit; if five characters share the syrup, each
stops aging for two years. Additional doses are not cumulative--later
imbibings supplant earlier ones. XP value: 500.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Wands and Staves</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
 
<P></P>
 <B>Wand of Shape Binding.</B> Characters often use this item <I>against</I> druids. When hit by its multicolored beam (projected up to 80 feet), beings
with the ability to shapechange or polymorph must save vs. wands at a -3
penalty. Victims who fail cannot voluntarily alter shape for 2d10 turns. Attempts to
shift shape using spells, magical items, or innate powers result in failure. A
use of this rechargeable wand consumes one charge per 4 HD or levels of the
subject. XP value: 800.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <B>Wanderer's Staff.</B> This resembles a stout oaken staff, which radiates magic and, in fact,
functions as a <I>quarterstaff +1.</I> However, its primary power is locomotion. If carried as a walking stick,
users hiking at a steady pace do not tire or need sleep. Any time spent walking
counts as sleep for the purpose of resting the character. If desired, the
character can walk night and day, taking only brief breaks for food, drink, etc. XP
value: 2,000.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Rings
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> 
<P></P>
 <B>Ring of the Hierophant.</B> Only druids can utilize this ring, which enables characters to speak the
language of elementals. This, the ring's lesser power, uses up no charges.
<P></P>
 More impressively, a druid wearing the ring may shapechange into an elemental.
Druids in elemental form retain their own hit points and saving throws, but
otherwise possess the characteristics of a 12 HD elemental. The transformation
functions just like a druid's shapechanging power this rechargeable ring even
restores hit points when the druid changes back. However, transformations last
only for a maximum of one hour. Each elemental form (air, fire, earth, and water)
may be assumed only once per month. XP value: 4,000.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapons
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> 
<P></P>
 <B>Lunar Sickle.</B> This weapon, a sickle crafted from silver and bound to the moon, may have
been forged for druids as a symbol of the cyclic nature of time. The sickle boasts
its greatest strength during the waxing moon. It has a +2 bonus from the new
moon to half moon, a +3 bonus from the half moon to full moon, and +4 during the
full moon. When the moon begins to wane, the<I> lunar sickle</I> drops to a +1 bonus. During the dark of the moon it loses all magical
bonuses; until the new moon rises, it no longer affects creatures that can be hit only
by magical weapons. XP value: 1,500.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <B>Sickle of the Harvest.</B> This sickle appears to be a normal farm implement, albeit of superior
quality. If used in combat, it functions as a +1 weapon. However, its real power is as
a magical harvesting tool.
<P></P>
 Anyone who grasps the sickle and speaks in the secret language of the druids
can order the sickle to harvest a field on its own. When so commanded, the
sickle takes to the air and harvests up to half an acre of grain per turn. It can
accept precise orders, such as, &quot;Cut down all stalks of ripe grain within a mile,
save for Farmer Dowd's field.&quot;
<P></P>
 The sickle continues working until: three hours pass; its owner orders it to
stop; or it moves a mile from its owner. Characters can also halt the sickle by
destroying it or snatching it out of the air. Anyone trying to grab the sickle
must make a successful attack roll against AC -4. Those who fail suffer 1d6+1
points of damage; success means a character grabs it and stops the harvesting.
<P></P>
 Treat attacks on the sickle as attacks against a <I>sword of dancing</I>; the sickle, while physically unstoppable, can be affected by failing a
saving roll against a spell such as <I>fireball, lightning bolt</I>, or <I>transmute metal to wood</I>. 
<P></P>
XP value: 1,300.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <B>Heartwood Cudgel.</B> This club, made from the heartwood of an oak, is a <I>club +1-- club +2</I> in a druid's hands. XP value: 500.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <B>Mistletoe Dart.</B> The body and tip of this dart are fashioned from enchanted mistletoe. Magical
armor, shields, or rings give no bonus protection against it; for example, a
person wearing <I>chain mail +4</I> would have AC 5, not AC 1. Darts, while not innately poisonous, can be coated
with any venom. Characters usually find these darts in groups of 2 to 8 (2d4).
XP value: 50 each.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Armor
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> 
<P></P>
 <B>Antlered Helm.</B> This metal-reinforced leather helm, adorned with a stag's antlers, allows the
wearer to run like a deer, with a base movement rate of 18. Moreover, stags
and deer see, hear, and smell wearers of an <I>antlered helm</I> as if they were stags, and react accordingly. This power makes the item very
useful for hunting. XP value: 800.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Miscellaneous Magic
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> 
<P></P>
 <B>Bountiful Spade.</B> Characters who use this enchanted farm implement to turn over the earth prior
to planting a field receive a +3 bonus on their agriculture proficiency check
for that year. XP value: 500.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <B>Cloak of the Beasts.</B> This plain brown cloak bears patches of many different animal skins. A
character who speaks a word of command while wearing it instantly becomes transformed
into a random animal for 1d6 hours. The cloak and the person's other clothing
become part of the new form.
<P></P>
 The type of animal varies with each use of the cloak's power--roll 1d100 on
the <I>reincarnate</I> spell table (<A HREF="../PHB/DD02287.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD02287.html">PH, p. 235</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">), rerolling any nonanimal result. The nature of the change is identical to a
druidic shapechange, except that wearers have no control over which animal form
they take on and cannot change back until the enchantment wears off.
<P></P>
 Upon returning to normal, the wearer regains 10% to 60% of any lost hit points
(10d6). The cloak cannot be used again until 12 hours pass. XP value: 1,000.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <B>Druid's Yoke</B>. While this item looks like an ox yoke, it is small enough to fit a donkey or
human. Worn by an animal, it offers no benefit. If fastened onto a human,
demihuman, or humanoid, it transforms the wearer into a full-sized ox; the yoke
expands to fit. The ox retains the wearer's mind, but cannot speak or use spells
and becomes vulnerable to magic that affects normal animals. The effect lasts as
long as the yoke stays on the wearer can't remove it, but a friendly humanoid
can. A character reverts back to normal immediately after the yoke comes off.
Wearers killed in ox form die; their bodies revert back to humanoid form once
the yoke is removed. 
<P></P>
XP value: 2,000.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <B>Herbmaster's Pouch.</B> This small bag of finely woven grass keeps herbs--including herbal magical
ingredients--as fresh as if newly harvested. The -2 penalty for using preserved
herbs to create magical herbal brews does not apply to ingredients kept in an <I>herbmaster's pouch</I>. XP value: 500.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <B>Necklace of Beast Speech.</B> This gold choker bears the image of a particular beast. To determine what
kind, roll on the <I>reincarnate</I> table (<A HREF="../PHB/DD02287.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD02287.html">PH, p. 235</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">), rerolling any result that's not an animal.
<P></P>
 Anyone who dons the device loses all power of speech, except with the animal
species on the necklace. The character cannot remove the choker without a wish
spell; a carefully worded wish might allow a wearer to retain the necklace and
beast speech and regain human speech. XP value: 0.
<P></P>
 
<P></P>
 <B>Seeds of the Hedge.</B> Usually found in a leather bag or pouch, these seeds resemble flower or grass
seeds. A pinch of <I>hedge seed</I> sprinkled on earth or grass instantly causes a thorny hedge to grow. The user
can decide to make this 10-foot - 10-foot - 5-foot hedge 5 feet long, 5 feet
high, or 5 feet wide.
<P></P>
 Creatures caught in the hedge's growth or trying to break through the hedge
suffer 8 points of damage plus additional points equal to their Armor Class
(excluding Dexterity adjustments). It takes two turns to safely cut through each
5-foot thickness. Normal fire does not harm it, but magical fire sets it ablaze in
one turn, creating a temporary<I> wall of fire</I> effect (as if cast by a 9th-level wizard) of the same size. One bag of seeds
sows three hedges. XP value: 600.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <B>Seeds of Plenty. </B>An ample sack holds magical seeds of the crop most important to local farmers
enough to sow a single large field. The only thing unusual about the seed is
that it radiates magic (noticeable if a character checks). Fields sown with this
seed produce superior crops: exceptionally large plants that prove resistant to
disease.
<P></P>
 <I>Seeds of plenty</I> double a normal harvest, increasing a typical farm family's income 50% to
100% for the year. Furthermore, products made from the crop are superior. Porridge
or bread made from a grain harvest prove especially tasty and nutritious;
clothes made from flax crops have exceptionally high quality; and so on. For this
reason, a known sack of <I>seeds of plenty </I>sells for up to 2,000 gp. 
<P></P>
XP value: 200 per sack.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <B>Seeds of Doom.</B> A sack holding these seeds appears identical to one filled with <I>seeds of plenty</I>. However, sowing a field with these seeds leads to disaster. The night after
the planting, a dense field of noxious weeds springs up, each weed 5 to 7 feet
high. Anyone less than giant size passing through the weeds can move only 10
feet per round. One turn after spending any time in the weeds, those not fully
covered in armor (generally, anyone not wearing plate mail or better) must save
vs. poison. Those who fail instantly develop a painful rash that lasts 2d6 days
(-2 penalty to all attack rolls, as well as attribute and proficiency checks;
-4 penalty if wearing armor or tight clothing).
<P></P>
 Weeds set ablaze do burn, producing a foul stench that lasts 2d6 turns
(equivalent to a <I>stinking cloud</I> spell over the field) and leaves a residual unpleasant smell for 2d6 days.
Furthermore, the black ash left behind poisons the field so nothing will grow
there for 2d6 years. Uprooting the weeds manually requires 100 people working for
a week, due to the weeds' fast growth. XP value: 0.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <B>Serpent Seeds</B>. Normally available in a packet of 1d3 seeds, a <I>serpent seed</I> springs up into a 20-foot tree one round after being planted in an inch of
dirt, watered, and told to grow in the druids' secret language. A serpent tree
has no branches; its limbs are 1d8 brown serpents with green eyes, barklike skin,
and wooden fangs dripping with poisonous white sap.
<P></P>
 While the tree cannot move, its branches can reach out up to 20 feet and
follow the druid's orders. Each serpent-branch's bite is poisonous. A person who
fails to save vs. poison becomes incapacitated within one turn; the character does
not die, but slowly becomes transformed into a &quot;serpent of the tree,&quot; a
nonpoisonous version of the branch-snakes.
<P></P>
 Despite its barky appearance, this new creature resembles nonpoisonous snakes
of the region in appetite and attacks. While serpents of the tree are not
attached to the serpent tree, they remain subject to the druid's orders, just like
the tree itself.
<P></P>
 A victim can be restored with a <I>cure serious wounds</I> or <I>heal</I> spell administered within one day of the bite. On the second day, the
transformation to a serpent of the tree is nearly complete; only a <I>wish </I>can return the victim to normal then.
<P></P>
 The serpent tree remains permanently where planted and stays loyal to its
maker as long as it exists. XP value: 1,000 per seed.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 Serpent tree: Int Low (5); AL N; AC 6; MV 0; HD 6+6; THAC0 15; #AT 1/limb; Dmg
1d4/limb; SA poison changes victims into serpents of the tree; ML 8; SZ H; XP
875.
<P></P>
 Serpent of the tree: Int Animal (1); AL N; AC 5; MV 15; HD 2+1; THAC0 19; #AT
1; Dmg 1; ML 8; SZ S (5 ft.); XP 90.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <B>Stone of Lost Ways.</B> This pebble might be mistaken for any other magical stone. However, those who
carry it through trackless wilderness (not following a road or path) increase
their chances of becoming hopelessly lost. Having a character with a <I>stone of lost ways</I> in a party adds 20% to the group's chance of becoming lost, in any terrain.
(See <A HREF="../DMG/DD00651.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../DMG/DD00651.html">Table 81</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> in the <I>DMG</I>, p. 128.) Furthermore, two checks instead of the normal one are needed, one
for each half-day's travel. The stone affects only characters traveling on the
ground. XP value: 0.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <B>Swarm Queen's Crown.</B> This dread item resembles a gold tiara set with a piece of amber encasing an
insect--usually a queen bee. The crown has a value of 2,000 gp.
<P></P>
 With a command word, a user's body mutates into a human-shaped mass of
stinging, venomous wasps, bees, and spiders: a miniature, living <I>creeping doom</I>. The user's new &quot;body&quot; contains 10 insects per hit point. For example, a
character with 10 hit points becomes a mass of 100 insects.
<P></P>
 The user attacks by touching someone (a normal attack roll). After a hit, the
user decides how many insects sting or bite the victim. Either 10, 20, or 30
insects may swarm over a victim per attack; for every 10 insects that hit, the
victim loses 1d10 hit points, and the wearer of the crown loses 1 hp--each insect
dies after its attack. So, a character may inflict up to 3d10 points of damage
per attack at the cost of 3 hp.
<P></P>
 While in insect form, the user has a move of 3, but can climb walls and
ceilings. The user cannot employ any weapons, spells, magical items, tools, or armor.
The swarm, which has AC 0, suffers no damage from piercing weapons (P), 1
point of damage from slashing weapons (S), and half damage from bludgeoning weapons
(B). Magical bonuses and fire inflict full damage. Every point of damage to
the wearer kills 10 insects. The user remains transformed as long as desired, but
the crown can be used only once per day. XP value: 4,000.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <B>Treeship.</B> A living tree shaped like a currach (<A HREF="../PHB/DD01628.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01628.html">PH, p. 71</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">), a <I>treeship</I> unites the magic of druids and the craftsmanship of elves. The mast is a
magical tree, from which hang branchlike rigging and leaf-sails. The roots form the
hull's ribs, covered by thick bark instead of hide. A ship carries up to eight
people and 5 tons of cargo. While the vessel cannot sail by itself, a crew
finds it quite seaworthy and swift (seaworthiness 80%, base move 3/6, emergency
move 12).
<P></P>
 <I>Treeships</I> can sail only in freshwater lakes, rivers, and seas; salt water poisons them
within a week. When beached on grass or soil (not sand) for more than a week,
they grow additional roots into the soil and require 1d6 days of pruning to
become seaworthy again. XP value: 6,000.
<P></P>
