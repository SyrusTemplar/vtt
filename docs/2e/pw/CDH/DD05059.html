 While most druids eventually settle in a specific locale, Wanderers travel
widely, delighting in Nature's infinite variety of life. They typically have a
better idea of the &quot;big picture&quot; in the world than other druids and usually remain
on good terms with local bards and rangers. Druidic leaders often use
Wanderers as messengers or missionaries.
<P></P>
 <B>Role:</B> Wanderers like Fife (right), more gregarious than most druids, enjoy meeting
and talking with people--especially rural folk. Although Fife acts carefree,
this genial nature masks a keen mind and a strong interest in everything going on
around her. Many Wanderers have animal companions.
<P></P>
 <B>Branch Restrictions:</B> None.
<P></P>
 <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Recommended</I>-- staff, one other weapon.
<P></P>
 <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Hunter, navigator.
<P></P>
 Nonweapon Proficiencies: <I>Bonus</I>-- direction sense. <I>Recommended</I>--(general) animal training, singing, weather sense; (priest) healing,
herbalism, religion; (warrior) mountaineering, running, survival, tracking.
<P></P>
 <B>Equipment:</B> The druid should spend her initial allotment of gold pieces entirely on
equipment, as she loses all unspent starting money in excess of 1 gp.
<P></P>
 <B>Special Benefits:</B> A Wanderer like Fife receives a +1 reaction adjustment bonus from bards,
rangers and traveling folk such as tinkers and Gypsies.
<P></P>
 When traveling over long distances, Fife covers ground at a one-third faster
rate than a normal traveler would--that is, if a normal person can walk 24 miles
in a day without force-marching, the druid can walk 32 miles with the same
exertion. Fife, like all Wanderers, simply feels more accustomed to walking long
distances than most--plus, she knows short cuts and secret trails. (This
heightened speed is cumulative with the ability of many druids 3rd level and higher to
travel through overgrowth or other difficult terrain without penalty.)
<P></P>
 With a Wanderer guide, a party can increase travel time by one-sixth; thus, an
unencumbered party led by a Wanderer would travel 28 miles in a day, not 24.
<P></P>
 <B>Special Hindrances:</B> Constantly on the move, a Wanderer never allows herself to be burdened. Fife
cannot have retainers, hirelings, mercenaries, or even servants until she
reaches 12th level (but animal companions can travel with her). The druid cannot
possess more treasure than she can carry; she either converts the excess into a
portable form (gems, etc.) or donates it to a worthy cause, such as the druidic
order.
<P></P>
 <B>Wealth Options:</B> 3d6x10 gp.
