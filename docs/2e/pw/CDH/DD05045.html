<P></P>
 Each kit entry begins with a description discussing the nature of the kit and
listing any special requirements a character needs to take it. (For instance,
to live as a Savage druid, the character must have been born into--or adopted
by--a primitive tribe.) This description introduces an archetype character
designed to demonstrate general attributes of the kit, <I>not </I>to serve as a character you, the player, have to role-play in a campaign. A 
character of either gender can take any kit.
<P></P>
 The kit entries also include the following sections:
<P></P>
 <B>Role.</B> Role-playing suggestions are offered, as druids of varying kits can play
widely different roles in a campaign.
<P></P>
 <B>Branch Restrictions.</B> If a member of a specific druidic branch cannot take this kit, that
restriction is noted.
<P></P>
 <B>Weapon Proficiencies.</B> A druid with the kit in question should take <I>recommended</I> proficiencies but must take <I>required</I> ones.
<P></P>
 <B>Secondary Skills.</B> If your DM uses the rules for secondary skills, you may choose from Table 36 (<A HREF="../PHB/DD01536.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01536.html">PH, p. 53)</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> or select one of the choices listed here, in addition to those skills
appropriate to the character's druidic branch.
<P></P>
 <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies.</B> A given druid kit usually requires the character to choose certain nonweapon
proficiencies. Sometimes a proficiency merely is <I>recommended</I>--the character doesn't have to take it. Often kits offer a bonus proficiency,
which does not use up a proficiency slot. Druids can take both priest and
warrior proficiencies at normal cost (<A HREF="../PHB/DD01538.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01538.html">PH, pgs. 54-55</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">).
<P></P>
 <B>Equipment.</B> A few druid kits limit the type and amount of equipment the character can
start with, acquire, or use.
<P></P>
 <B>Special Benefits.</B> This paragraph details additional abilities of druids with this kit.
<P></P>
 <B>Special Hindrances.</B> This section discusses any kit's restrictions, limitations, or disadvantages.<B>
<P></P>
 Wealth</B> Options. Usually the character starts with the priest's standard 3d6x10 gp.
