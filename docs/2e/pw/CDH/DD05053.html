 In a region where evil forces have triumphed and hold a position of authority,
good people who resist have turned outlaw. From their exile in the wilderness,
these folk conduct guerrilla warfare against the cruel victors in the fashion
of Robin Hood and his Merry Men. Since the balance has swung so far to the side
of evil, the druid may freely act as a military commander in the struggle to
overthrow the oppressors. In some situations, the druidic order itself may be
outlawed; then the Outlaw druid faces threats like widespread persecution of
druid followers and burning of sacred groves.
<P></P>
 <B>Role: </B>Because an outlaw band often fights in the wilderness (ambushing enemies along
forest roads or defending against patrols), the druid's powers and skills
naturally come to the forefront. One such Outlaw druid is Mackay. (See illustration
on this page.) Outside combat, he proves excellent at gathering information
and using his priestly curative powers. Depending on the nature and alignment of
those in the group, you can role-play the Outlaw druid as just another party
member or as the band's spiritual (or actual) leader.
