 Only a limited number of druids in a given circle can reach the<I> inner circle</I>--nine of druid rank, three archdruids, and a single great druid. A character
cannot replace one of these druids without having sufficient experience. In
addition, a vacancy must open up, or the rising druid must defeat one of the
current higher-level characters the druidic challenge to assume a new rank.
<P></P>
 Some tension exists between druids of the inner circle, since they remain
constantly aware that a subordinate may be preparing a challenge. Unlike clerics,
who normally settle down by this point, high-level druids continue adventuring
as part of their duties and to stay in shape to fend off challengers.

<P></P>
 Upon reaching 12th level, a character receives the official title <I>druid</I>, of which a circle never has more than nine. (Lower-level characters, though
called &quot;druids&quot; by most, are technically &quot;initiates.&quot;) A druid's role in the
circle resembles that of a 7th- to 11th-level initiate, with some exceptions.
<P></P>
 At 12th level, a druid has gained access to the <I>commune with nature</I> spell and should use it along with other druidic resources to aggressively
root out emergent threats to the wilderness within a domain. Druids attend the
High Council of the Moot (described later this chapter) and always act based on
the needs of the circle as a whole. The circle's great druid at times asks
12th-level druids for advice and sends them on missions for the good of the circle.
<P></P>
 But the life of a druid involves more than just adventuring--serving as a
mentor takes up much of a druid's time, too. Selecting young people to train as
druidic candidates constitutes a major responsibility of those who reach druid
rank. Each year druids (and other inner circle members) pick the single most
worthy of their advanced students to initiate into the Order as 1st-level druids.
(For more on initiations, see <A HREF="DD05067.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD05067.html">Chapter 4: Role-playing Druids</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">.)
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Archdruids
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> 
<P></P>
 A 13th-level druid is called an <I>archdruid</I>. Each circle can have only three archdruids and, as with the druid rank,
advancement requires either filling a vacancy or winning a challenge against a
seated archdruid.
<P></P>
 An archdruid's role resembles that of a druid, with two differences.
Archdruids concern themselves more with maintaining the balance of Nature, making sure
no one alignment or ethos comes to utterly dominate the domain. Also, archdruids
spend time training to step into the role of the great druid. To accomplish
both these goals, they devote much time to travel, ensuring their familiarity
with the geography--human, natural, and magical--throughout the domain.
<P></P>
 <B>The Moot.</B> The three archdruids share the druid's responsibility for initiating
newcomers to the Order. In addition, they each have the right to summon a moot: a
gathering of the entire circle, traditionally held at the solstices and equinoxes.
By ancient custom, moots are called four times a year at these set dates, once
by each archdruid and once (usually in spring) by the great druid. A moot on a
nontraditional date means the summoner sees something so deeply amiss in the
domain that the entire circle must discuss it as soon as possible.
<P></P>
 These gatherings enable the circle to celebrate the changing of the seasons,
to gossip and socialize, to exchange information on the state of the domain, and
to fight druidic challenges before an audience. Druids at a moot perform
ceremonies to celebrate Nature, honor their dead, marry a couple within the Order,
and initiate new 1st-level druids. Along with these ceremonial duties, small
groups at moots disappear together into the wilds to talk quietly while searching
for herbs or mistletoe.
<P></P>
 The climax of any such gathering is the High Council of the Moot; the circle's
nine druids, three archdruids, and great druid meet in a secret location to
discuss the state of the domain and make plans to rally the circle against a
particular problem, if necessary. Sometimes an ambassador from a neighboring circle
(usually a character of at least druid rank) or an emissary of the Grand Druid
attends a council. These personages bring news and greetings--and sometimes
requests for help. After the High Council, the great druid (or an archdruid)
addresses the entire moot, answers questions, and takes advice.
<P></P>
 To call a moot, an archdruid (or the great druid) sends messengers out across
the domain to spread the word to druids of all branches. All members of the
circle above 7th level must attend or explain the absence. Members of 3rd to 6th
level may come, but usually do so only if their journeys bring them to the
vicinity or if they have business with others there. Those of 1st or 2nd level may
attend a moot only with the permission of a member of the inner circle.
<P></P>
 The moot is scheduled to begin two weeks after the summoner dispatches the
announcements, giving all druids in the circle enough time to settle their
business and arrive. Such a gathering generally takes place at a sacred grove under
the stewardship of the summoner. Though most moots last about four days, the
meeting cannot end until the summoning archdruid or the great druid dissolves it.
<P></P>
 Bards, elves, rangers, swanmays, and other sylvan folk often are invited to a
moot, but its location remains a secret to others. In troubled times, elves,
rangers, friendly beasts, or forest creatures may patrol the moot and take
trespassers prisoner.
<P></P>
 If the domain's circle is on good terms with the land's rangers, a spring or
autumnal moot may take place in conjunction with a rangers' forgathering. (See <A HREF="../CRH/DD05756.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../CRH/DD05756.html">Chapter 10: Forgatherings</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> in<I> The Complete Ranger's Handbook</I>.) However, like rangers, druids prefer to keep their gatherings to
themselves, and such cooperation usually results from personal friendships between the
great druid and notable rangers--or signals a desperate alliance against a
greater foe.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Great Druids</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
 
<P></P>
 As stated earlier, the <I>great druid</I> leads a circle. Like other inner circle members, the great druid usually has
won the position through the challenge and has to maintain the ascendancy by
defeating other challengers. However, some great druids become so respected (or
feared!) that subordinate archdruids forgo challenging them, instead preferring
to enter the service of the Grand Druid or wait until the great druid advances
in level.
<P></P>
 All druids within a circle know the name of their great druid--even if they
have never met in person--because this figure wields a certain amount of power
over their lives. The DM should decide how strongly the great druid influences
the members of the circle. For instance, a great druid who is loved, respected,
or feared holds more sway over NPC druids than would a weak or unpopular leader.
While PCs remain free to pursue their own goals, opposing the policy of a
strong great druid means a character has little chance of receiving support from
superior druids. Supporting the leader's policy, on the other hand, can win
lesser druids praise and aid from the top.
<P></P>
 Turmoil can erupt within a circle governed by a weak or unpopular great druid,
as the ranking archdruids vie for the head post or ignore the leader's advice
to follow their own paths. Player characters may get occasional assistance from
inner circle druids in this scenario, but for the most part, individuals all
go their own way.
<P></P>
 The great druid has the same power to initiate druidic candidates and summon a
moot as archdruids. In addition, this figure has the job of maintaining
harmonious relations among all the druids of the circle--preventing factional battles
and infighting, other than what is allowed through the challenge. To do so,
the great druid has one special tool: the ban.
<P></P>
 <B>The Ban.</B> The great druid can impose a strong, nonviolent sanction upon those who have
offended the circle. All must shun someone placed under the ban; no druid in
the circle will aid, speak to, or associate with the target of the ban. When an
entire town or village suffers the ban, no druid may enter that area or speak to
or aid any resident. Some druidic allies volunteer to follow the custom of the
ban as well. For instance, a clan of sprites or centaurs on good terms with a
circle may receive word of a ban and choose to honor it.
<P></P>
 The great druid has the right to pronounce a ban on any druid in the circle. A
ban also can cover nondruids, whole communities, or druids visiting from other
domains (except the Grand Druid and personal servants), to demonstrate the
circle's displeasure.
<P></P>
 To pronounce the ban, the great druid stands up during a moot and announces to
the group the reasons to impose the ban. Then the subject of the ban--if
present--answers the accusations before the assembly. Finally, the High Council of
the Moot votes on the matter openly, usually at sunset. If a majority of the
council votes in favor of the ban, it passes. If not, the great druid should start
keeping an eye on the circle's archdruids--the opposition to the ban likely
reflects an impending challenge.
<P></P>
 A ban punishes a druid for violating the tenets of the druidic order or
reprimands a character whose actions, while within the bounds of the druidic ethos,
nevertheless were contrary to the Order's interests. For instance, suppose an
angry druid massacred the inhabitants of a human hamlet because they would not
turn over two hunters who slew a stag in the druid's sacred grove. The druid
acted within the bounds of the druidic ethos, but the great druid might call the
character's indiscriminate vengeance out of proportion to the crime, adding that
the slaughter has threatened to make local commoners hate and fear all druids
in the circle. So, the great druid imposes the ban, both as a punishment and as
incentive for the character to change.
<P></P>
 Nondruid individuals are less likely to fall victim to a ban--usually the
great druid finds that direct action against the offender proves more effective.
However, if the people of an area depend on druids rather than other priests for
healing and religious ceremonies, a ban sends them a message of disapproval.
And sometimes a ban can serve as a symbolic gesture against a subject too
powerful or influential to confront directly--a baron or king, for instance.
<P></P>
 A ban generally lasts 10 summers. However, the inner circle can vote to lift a
ban early or (once the time is up) to extend it. The shunning does not extend
outside the domain, so banned druids usually choose to go into exile--the
result the great druid probably intended in the first place.
<P></P>
 <B>The Challenge.</B> The traditions of the Order prohibit an inner circle from including more than
nine druids, three archdruids, and one great druid. If a character gains
enough experience to achieve official druid level but finds no vacancy in the inner
circle, the only way to advance involves ceremonial combat: the druidic
challenge.
<P></P>
 The challenge remains one of the oldest druidic traditions. It purges the weak
and complacent, ensuring that the highest ranks of the druidic order remain
filled with strong and cunning individuals. The masters of the druidic order are
not politicians, but men and women of action. They believe that the challenge,
by bringing ambition into the open, allows them to by-pass some of the worst
excesses of hypocrisy and behind-the-scenes power plays found in other religions.
<P></P>
 A circle's great druid expects at any time to face a challenge from one of the
archdruids, while the archdruids keep an eye on rising druids. Those of druid
rank, in turn, look out for ambitious 11th-level initiates. This system puts a
constant strain on the Order's upper ranks: It's hard to stay on good terms
with folk who want your job and eventually will challenge you to a battle to gain
it. As a result, most friendships and alliances form among druids of equal
level or among characters several levels apart.
<P></P>
 All inner circle druids do their best to appear strong, to avoid looking like
easy targets. Many actively adventure to enhance their reputations and gain
power through acquiring magical items and experience. Others simply try to remain
popular among the other members of the Order. If an inner circle member takes
an unpopular or controversial stance, fellow druids may decide to encourage the
ambitious to aim for that particular target; the replacement would likely prove
more cordial.
<P></P>
 The challenge operates under prearranged rules: Characters who violate the
letter of the rules will fail to advance in level, just as if they had suffered
defeat. Always a one-on-one battle, the challenge does not allow even servants or
animal companions of the combatants to participate.
<P></P>
 First, the two parties must agree upon the time of the duel--if they can't
agree, it will take place at the next moot. Druids consider it impolite to set a
challenge outside of a moot, although it's still done.
<P></P>
 Second, the challenge needs a witness--a druid whose level equals or exceeds
the challenger's. Hierophant druids (described later in this chapter) work well
as witnesses, as do druids or archdruids visiting from different circles or
from the Grand Druid's entourage. This individual must witness the terms of the
challenge and make sure the combatants obey the rules. The great druid of the
circle always names the witness, even if the challenge involves that very leader.
<P></P>
 Third, the terms by which the battle will be fought are set out by mutual
agreement. Once agreed upon and witnessed, the terms may not change. If neither
side can agree on the terms, the witness selects them and proclaims the duel an
all-out battle until one druid surrenders or becomes incapacitated.
<P></P>
 Terms to discuss include:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The size of the battlefield. Until the duel ends, leaving the bounds of the
area means conceding defeat. Usually the space is no more than a dozen yards
across, to ensure the battle does not take too long.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Whether to allow weapons, magical items, granted powers, and spells. (Note:
Nondruidic spells <I>cannot</I> be used.) Most contests involve full use of weapons and spells, although many
commonly disallow magical items. Some memorable duels have permitted <I>only</I> granted powers--no spells or weapons. The combatants used only the claws and
fangs of their different animal forms. A few challenges have forbidden all
weapons and magic--they became simple wrestling matches.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Whether to alter the normal battle-oriented conditions of the duel. Although
rare, methods less stringent than actual combat have been honored, especially
between two friendly rivals. Such unorthodox formats include a race, a scavenger
hunt, a competition to defeat a particular monster, a drinking contest (the
first druid to fail three Constitution rolls loses), or even a game of hide and
seek.
<P></P>
 The challenge begins with the witness's invocation, asking Nature (or a
druidic deity) to watch over the duel. This means that challengers who defeat foes
through cheating will find themselves unable to gain a level after all, and
incumbents who cheat automatically lose the level. Once the witness concludes the
invocation, the druids enter the battlefield from opposite ends, and the contest
begins.
<P></P>
 <B>Appointment of Acolytes.</B> Great druids, archdruids, and druids have the traditional right to select
initiates as their servants. The number and level of these retainers depends on
the level and position of the inner circle member. (<A HREF="../PHB/DD01496.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01496.html">See the PH, p. 37, for details</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">.) The chosen initiates are called <I>acolytes</I>.
<P></P>
 Acolytes, chosen from the high-ranking druid's own circle, are restricted to
serving only certain inner circle members (again, based on their experience
level). The appointing druid must determine which eligible initiates will serve him.
<P></P>
 An inner circle druid usually approaches a favored initiate quietly and offers
an acolyte position. The initiate then decides whether to accept the post.
While serving as an acolyte holds honor, it also entails a loss of freedom.
Therefore, the decision depends on factors such as the reputation of the inner circle
member.
<P></P>
 An acolyte swears an oath of service: to be loyal and obedient, to listen and
learn, to keep no secrets from one's master, but to guard the master's secrets.
An acolyte who breaks this oath faces the wrath of the high-ranking druid. In
addition, unless the acolyte can prove the master's commands violated the
spirit of the druidic ethos, the servant usually becomes subjected to the ban.
<P></P>
 The advantage of serving as an acolyte is that the character wins the
patronage, and perhaps the friendship, of a powerful druid. The position enhances the
initiate's prestige in the eyes of the entire circle. Furthermore, acolytes
injured or wronged by an enemy can expect assistance from their master.
<P></P>
 The disadvantage? The character-- always at the beck and call of a master--
loses personal freedom. An acolyte fulfills all the normal duties of a loyal
retainer but, most importantly, acts as an emissary and representative of the inner
circle druid. As high-level druids cannot be everywhere at once, acolytes
often go on long journeys to do their master's bidding. Whether the mission
involves finding a reclusive swamp-dwelling initiate to notify of the next moot's date
and location or delivering a stinging ultimatum to a dwarven king to shut down
his mines or face the circle's wrath, acolytes can expect to visit a lot of
interesting--though sometimes unpleasant--places.
<P></P>
 An acolyte's term of service lasts until the master's experience level changes
or until the acolyte advances a level. In the latter case, the acolyte leaves
service, and the inner circle member must select a replacement.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>The Grand Druid
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> 
<P></P>
 Above all others within the Order stands the figure of the <I>Grand Druid</I>, the highest-ranking (although not the highest-level) druid in the world. The
Grand Druid, a 15th-level character, attains this position through a selection
process rather than by the challenge. Since only one person can hold the title
of Grand Druid, each world can have only one 15th-level druid at a time.
<P></P>
 <B>Duties of the Grand Druid</B>. First and foremost, the Grand Druid acts as a politician, responsible for
keeping harmony between the great druids of each domain and between the various
druidic branches.
<P></P>
 The Grand Druid also rallies the circles against the rare global threat to
Nature or the cosmic balance. This always proves a difficult task, as many circles
fiercely cherish their autonomy, believing each one should remain
self-sufficient and not meddle in other domains' affairs. Few circles willingly send
contingents off to aid other circles unless they feel absolutely certain that the
threat will menace their own domain as well. To make matters worse, the inflated
pride of many circles prevents them from accepting help from &quot;foreign&quot; druids.
As a result, often only one thing can convince the Order a threat warrants a
combined effort: the destruction of an entire circle. Fortunately, such
occurrences are few and far between.
<P></P>
 The Grand Druid and entourage (detailed below) spend most of their time
visiting different regions and speaking to the great druids, archdruids, druids, and,
rarely, lowly initiates. In particular, this leader serves as a diplomat and
peacemaker, who mediates disputes between druids of neighboring circles and
struggles involving members of the mysterious Shadow Circle (described later in
this chapter).
<P></P>
 Normally the circles act with autonomy. However, if a circle appears in great
disarray--for instance, an enemy has killed most of its members or forced them
into hiding--the Grand Druid may try to rally the circle or recruit aid from
other domains. If a circle has been effectively destroyed, the Grand Druid might
decide to rebuild it from scratch. After selecting a rising archdruid from a
neighboring circle to step in as the new great druid, the Grand Druid helps
recruit volunteers from nearby domains to replenish the circle. Often this
assignment proves difficult and dangerous; whatever destroyed the previous circle
probably still lurks nearby, ready to pounce on the new circle that, while wary, will
remain understrength for some time.
<P></P>
 <B>Servants of the Grand Druid.</B> Like other inner circle druids, the Grand Druid has personal servants: an
entourage of nine druids of various levels. These druids no longer owe allegiance
to their original circles but are subject only to the Grand Druid. All druids
consider it a high honor to serve the leader of the Order, an honor that bears
great responsibility but gives a druid prestige and influence far beyond others
of similar level. Assuming a vacancy arises--and service involves enough danger
that openings occur reasonably often--a druid of any level can seek out the
Grand Druid and petition to become a retainer. This relationship lasts as long as
both sides wish--often many years--and can end by mutual agreement at any time.
<P></P>
 Three archdruids, often called the Emissaries, always serve the head of the
Order. They act as the Grand Druid's personal agents--their leader's eyes, hands,
and voice. To aid them in their duty, they receive four additional spell
levels (one 4th-level spell, two 2nd-level spells, etc.), usable as they see fit. To
keep the Grand Druid informed on the operations of the circles in every land,
they roam the world, visiting the various circles as well as other places of
interest to their master. The arrival of an Emissary often coincides with the
ascendance of a new great druid. While conveying the respects of the head of the
Order, the archdruid takes the new leader's measure and reports back to the
Grand Druid. These servants also visit a circle in response to a great druid's
request for aid.
<P></P>
 Traveling Emissaries normally find themselves welcomed, for their visits give
circles a chance to learn news from far-off lands. An Emissary also may offer
counsel about a menace or carry a request for help to the Grand Druid or
neighboring circles.
<P></P>
 But Emissaries also must remain on the alert for problems within a circle that
the great druid has failed to adequately handle--such as widespread conflicts
between druids or corruption in the ranks. In such cases, it is the Emissary's
solemn duty to take action to remedy the problem or, lacking sufficient power,
to report it the Grand Druid. For this reason, some circles-- particularly
those secretly dominated by the ruthless Shadow Circle--regard the arrival of an
Emissary with deep suspicion. In their role as agents of the Grand Druid, these
archdruids sometimes resemble spies. More than one Emissary has met a mysterious
end while visiting a supposedly friendly circle.
<P></P>
 Besides the Emissaries, a Grand Druid has six other servants. These druids,
usually of 7th to 11th level, come from a variety of branches but have all proven
their dedication to the Order. Many Grand Druids have been known to take on
the occasional lower-level druid, either because they feel the need for a fresher
viewpoint or because they sense a special worthiness in a particular
individual. These six druids of mixed level act as servants, counselors, bodyguards, and
useful agents.
<P></P>
 <B>Selection of the Grand Druid.</B> One of the duties each Grand Druid must perform is appointing a successor,
always an acting great druid. After serving usually a minimum of four years, a
Grand Druid steps down to allow the chosen successor to assume the mantle of
leadership.
<P></P>
 In theory, selecting a new Grand Druid is solely up to the last Grand Druid.
In practice, druidic order politics plays a major role. For instance, if the
forest druids have held the position of Grand Druid for several generations, they
may come to consider it &quot;their right&quot; to do so. However, in the name of
fairness and harmony, druids from other branches may lobby to convince the current
Grand Druid to pick a successor from a different branch. On the other hand,
choosing a Grand Druid from a minority branch could alienate large segments of the
druidic order's membership, even with an extremely competent Grand Druid.
<P></P>
 As a result, when a Grand Druid begins getting on in years, the impending
choice of successor becomes the subject of much gossip, speculation, lobbying, and
intrigue by archdruids, great druids, and hierophant druids. For instance, a
great druid afraid of being passed over for the position in favor of a rival may
encourage a powerful, ambitious archdruid to challenge that rival, hoping to
put the favorite out of the running before the Grand Druid can finalize the
succession.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Hierophant Druids
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> 
<P></P>
 The <I>hierophants</I> make up a unique part of the druidic order. Some even go so far as to say
they <I>are </I>the Order, and that the other ranks represent mere practice for hierophant
status. <A HREF="../PHB/DD01497.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01497.html">Check p. 38 of the PH</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><I> </I>for details on achieving the rank of hierophant (pictured on the next page)
and the powers that go with it.
<P></P>
 Hierophant druids live as free agents. They are encouraged to respect the
Grand Druid, but need not obey the druidic leader's mandates nor operate within the
borders of any circle. Although a few settle down in particular groves, many
become famous wanderers, some even visiting other planes or (by spelljamming)
distant worlds. They often travel about in disguise, using their
appearance-alteration powers. Wherever they go and whatever they do, they always aim to promote
the ethos and values of the druidic order.
<P></P>
 Unlike lesser druids, hierophants typically have a global perspective and
agenda. They concern themselves with the rise and fall of empires, the migrations
of peoples, the growth or extinction of species, and the role of each race in
the destiny of the world. Some devote their lives to a particular cause, such as
reclaiming the forests of a continent infected by evil, or acting as the
personal nemesis of a being whose actions threaten the world's balance.
<P></P>
 Hierophants are notorious behind-the-scenes manipulators. They use their long
life spans to weave subtle schemes with far-reaching plots that might take
decades to hatch, but which--they believe--ultimately will benefit their cause. The
17th-level druidic ability to hibernate enables most of them to appear
effectively immortal: some hierophants will hatch the initial elements of a scheme, go
into hibernation, then awaken decades later, unaged, to bring the next stage
into play. Such druids might become patrons of gifted families of adventurers,
recruiting the latest generation when they need heroes.
<P></P>
 The existence of hierophant druids tends to make great druids and Grand Druids
very nervous, for they represent a power beyond their control--and sometimes
beyond their ken. Whether any hierophant druids belong to the Shadow Circle is
not known.
