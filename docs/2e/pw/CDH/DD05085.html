 Druids have major access to spells in the following spheres of influence: All,
Animal, Elemental, Healing, Plant, Weather; they have minor access to the
Divination sphere. (Note any sphere restrictions due to kit or branch.) As druids
concern themselves with plants, animals, and natural phenomena more than most
priests, they specialize in casting Nature-oriented spells.
<P></P>
 Characters of any priest class have the potential to use these spells if they
have access to the relevant spheres. However, DMs may make this magic available
only to the druid class, on the grounds that these spells represent secret
lore of the Order.

Optional Sphere Expansions

 Some existing Nature-related spells remain unavailable to druids due to sphere
restrictions. To offer these spells to druids, DMs may expand the selection of
spells accessible through certain spheres of magic:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <I>Call woodland beings</I> becomes part of the Animal sphere.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <I>Commune with nature</I> becomes part of both the Animal and Plant spheres.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <I>Insect plague</I> becomes part of the Animal sphere.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <I>Reincarnate </I>becomes part of the Animal sphere.
<P></P>
 An expansion does not remove a spell from a sphere that already contains it,
but merely makes the spell accessible from an additional sphere or spheres.
