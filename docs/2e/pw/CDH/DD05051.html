 The strangest members of the druidic order, Lost Druids find that many other
druids no longer consider them kin. The Lost Druids come from lands that have
been maliciously destroyed--forests burned to the ground, swamps drained,
mountains ruined by mining, and so on. Rather than try to rebuild or move on, a Lost
Druid such as Struma (pictured next page) allows his heart to darken from
brooding on the devastation and embraces strange magic to seek revenge.
<P></P>
 Under extreme stress (and the DM's discretion), a druid may renounce a
particular kit forever and become a Lost Druid. Druids of 2nd or higher level lose one
level as a result of the change but suffer no other penalties. Note that this
is an exception to the rule on abandoning kits (p. 42), so the DM may wish to
restrict it to NPCs.
<P></P>
 <B>Role:</B> Lost Druids always feel bitter. Sometimes they go insane, their hearts filled
with an insatiable, often impossible, desire for vengeance against those who
destroyed their land. For instance, say Struma became a Lost Druid when he found
his forest destroyed by orcs. He may attempt to plot the downfall of the
entire orcish race and the death of every last orc. Most Lost Druids live solitary
existences, but sometimes they group together, often within the sinister Shadow
Circle. (<A HREF="DD05062.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD05062.html">See Chapter 3: The Druidic Order</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">.)
<P></P>
 <B>Branch Restrictions:</B> None.
<P></P>
 <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Recommended</I>-- scimitar, staff.
<P></P>
 <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Hunter, weaponsmith.
<P></P>
 <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Recommended</I>--(priest) herbalism, spellcraft; (warrior) animal lore, endurance, set
snares, survival.
<P></P>
 <B>Equipment:</B> A Lost Druid such as Struma should spend his initial allotment of gold pieces
entirely on equipment, as he loses any unspent starting money in excess of 1
gp.
<P></P>
 <B>Special Benefits:</B> The druid gains minor access to the Necromancy spell sphere. Upon reaching
6th level, he gains an additional power, the ability to animate dead animals.
Treat this power as the priest spell <I>animate dead</I>; however, the druid may use it only once per day, and it affects 1 HD of
normal (real-world) animals per level of the druid.
<P></P>
 <B>Special Hindrances:</B> The Lost Druid cast only the<I> reversed </I>versions of <I>heal</I> or <I>cure</I> spells.
<P></P>
 As a Lost Druid, Struma may never attain Grand Druid status, and thus may not
progress past it to hierophant rank. A character of Grand Druid or hierophant
rank may not become a Lost Druid.
<P></P>
 All rangers and druids with other kits react to Lost Druids at a -4 penalty,
usually with a mixture of pity and fear. (Other Lost Druids have only a -2
penalty to encounter reactions.) Most druids consider Lost Druids enemies and
attempt to hunt, slay, or imprison them.
<P></P>
 <B>Wealth Options:</B> 3d6x10 gp.
