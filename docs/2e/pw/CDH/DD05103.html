 A good many works of modern fantasy fiction deal with druids or druidlike
figures who act to magically preserve and protect Nature. Some of the best are
listed below, but many more Arthurian (Merlin was a druid!) or Celtic-inspired
fantasies await in bookstores and libraries.

<I>The Mists of Avalon</I>, Marion Zimmer Bradley. The story of King Arthur, Merlin, and Morgan le Fay
told from Morgan's point of view. Beautifully written.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<I>The Dreamstone</I>, C. J. Cherryh. Arafel, the last of the Sidhe and immortal protectress of the
wood, makes a good model for an eccentric Guardian druid. Sequel: <I>The Tree of Swords and Jewels.
<P></P>

<P></P>
Moonheart</I>, Charles De Lint. This novel has a modern setting, but its compelling tale of
bards, druids, shamans, and the meeting of Celtic and Amerind magic has
relevance to any fantasy campaign--as do most of De Lint's other novels (especially <I>Greenmantle</I>).
<P></P>

<P></P>
<I>The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever</I> series, Steven R. Donaldson. An outcast from our world becomes drawn
reluctantly into a struggle to save the magical Land from evil. The forces rallied in
defense of the Land hold ideas usable in a druidic campaign. Also relevant is
the theme of protecting a world against a corrupting evil.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<I>Moon of Gomrath</I>, Alan Garner. This tale, regarding the return of &quot;wild magic&quot; to England,
contains useful enchantments.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<I>Mythago Wood</I>, Robert Holdstock. This award-winner full of powerful images brims with
druidic magic and ancient mystery in England's woods. The Mythago Wood is the
archetypal primal forest; mythagos themselves would make an exciting mystery
encounter--and an interesting alternative to avatars. Sequel: <I>Lavondyss</I>.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<I>Druid</I>, Morgan Llywelyn. Clearly, this novel is superior historical fantasy.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<I>Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind</I>, Hayao Miyazaki. Nausicaa, the heroine of this excellent science-fantasy
comic (and  movie), resembles a gray druid with the Hivemaster kit.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<I>Moonshae and Druidhome trilogies</I>, Douglas Niles. These six books center around a druid who worships the
Earthmother  in the Forgotten Realms setting.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<I>The Forest of Forever</I>, Thomas Burnett Swann. This is one of several novels by Swann that focuses on
sylvan folk, dryads,  and the like within an ancient setting.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<I>Lord of the Rings</I>, J. R. R. Tolkein. The encounters with the Old Forest, Tom Bombadil,
Radagast, and Treebeard contain many ideas usable within a druidic campaign. Some think
Gandalf resembles a druid far more than a wizard.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<I>The Seedbearers</I> trilogy, Peter Valentine. This series postulates a druid migration to Great
Britain following the sinking of Atlantis. Its action continues up to Rome's
destruction of the druids.

<I>Halls of the High King</I> (FA1), Ed Greenwood. This Forgotten Realms adventure contains information on
druidic groves in the Realms, including their unique &quot;moonwells.&quot;
<P></P>

<P></P>
<I>Celts Campaign Sourcebook</I> (HR3), Graeme Davis. This book provides rules on how the very different
Celtic druids of ancient Britain, Gaul, and Ireland can work within a historical
fantasy AD&amp;D game. It has a useful bibliography on historical druids.
