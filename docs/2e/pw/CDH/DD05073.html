 You've now read how typical druids act in a variety of situations. But every
druid--just like every other PC or significant NPC--should be different, with
unique habits and personality traits. Chapter 2: Druid Kits illustrated the
&quot;role&quot; of each kit and how a druid with a certain kit usually behaves. But not every
druid of the same branch and kit acts the same way. To expand on this idea, a
half-dozen common personality archetypes for druids follow.
<P></P>
 Please note that using these personality types is totally optional--feel free
to make up your own! This section, while intended for use primarily by novice
role-players, can prove quite useful for experienced players who feel
temporarily stumped for role-playing ideas or for DMs wanting a quick personality for an
NPC druid.
