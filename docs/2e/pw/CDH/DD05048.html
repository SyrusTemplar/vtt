 A deep--perhaps instinctive--knowledge of the habits, actions, and behavior of
animals comes naturally to a Beastfriend. Lasell, a typical Beastfriend
character (pictured on the next page) feels quite protective of animals and fiercely
punishes those who inflict unnecessary harm upon them. She has nothing against
people hunting for food (which, after all, animals also do) but considers
hunting for sport repugnant and the use of animals in gladiatorial games a horrible
crime.
<P></P>
 <B>Role: </B>A Beastfriend like Lasell spends most of her time in the company of animals.
In fact, she lives so much of her life around animals that sometimes she lacks
social graces among humans. Many Beastfriends are gruff and hostile, preferring
the company of honest natural creatures to deceitful humans, demihumans, and
humanoids; others like people, but feel shy or tongue-tied around them and
sometimes behave with poor manners. Lasell, like most with her kit, usually travels
with one or more animal companions to whom she feels especially devoted.

 <B>Branch Restrictions:</B> None.
<P></P>
 <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Recommended</I>-- staff.
<P></P>
 <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Groom, hunter.
<P></P>
 <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonus</I>-- animal lore. <I>Recommended</I>--(general) animal handling, animal training, riding (land-based), riding
(airborne); (priest) healing.
<P></P>
 <B>Equipment:</B> The druid should spend her initial allotment of gold pieces entirely on
equipment, as she loses any unspent starting money in excess of 1 gp.
<P></P>
 <B>Special Benefits:</B> If Lasell, as a Beastfriend, carefully but fearlessly approaches a tamed or
untamed animal, she can try to modify the beast's reaction. The druid can affect
only natural animals--that is, those found in the real world (bears, wolves,
snakes, etc.), as well as giant or magically enlarged versions of normal
animals. When dealing with a nonhostile or domestic animal, the druid can approach and
befriend it automatically. Wild beasts or animals trained to fight (like
attack dogs or war horses) get a saving throw vs. rods to resist the druid at a
minimum penalty of -1. An additional -1 penalty applies for every four full levels
the druid has achieved: -2 at 4th level, -3 at 8th, etc. (The druid's power is
not magical, though.) If the animal fails to save, the druid may choose to
shift its reaction one category either direction on <A HREF="../DMG/DD00556.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../DMG/DD00556.html">Table 56</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> (<I>DMG</I>, p. 103).
<P></P>
 The Beastfriend receives a +4 bonus on animal lore, animal training, and
animal handling proficiency checks. If she does not have the actual proficiency, she
can function as if she did, without the +4 bonus.
<P></P>
 If Lasell, as a Beastfriend, casts an Animal sphere spell on an animal, the
subject saves against it at a -2 penalty.
<P></P>
 Thanks to her knowledge of animals, a Beastfriend can recognize a lycanthrope
(whether in human or animal form) on a successful animal lore check. The
Beastfriend notes subtle differences in the behavior of a lycanthrope in animal form
compared to a normal animal; she also notices subliminal clues in the movement
and behavior of a lycanthrope in human form that point to its animal nature.
The Beastfriend may make her one check only after she has been in the
lycanthrope's presence for a round.
<P></P>
 <B>Special Hindrances: </B>A Beastfriend does everything she can to help and treat a hurt animal or free
an abused one and will kill an animal only to put a dying beast out of its
misery. A Beastfriend who has come to know an animal may not harm it, allow others
to hurt it, or send it suicidally into harm's way. In general, the Beastfriend
does not recruit animals specifically as bodyguards; rather, she accumulates
friends and pets, who may choose to do favors for her, such as scouting or
defending her. In return, the druid feeds and shelters them, heals their injuries,
and rescues them from captivity.
<P></P>
 As with all Beastfriends, Lasell's lack of social grace prevents her from
learning the etiquette proficiency and gives her a -1 penalty to encounter
reactions with those of her own race (except another with her kit).
<P></P>
 <B>Wealth Options:</B> 3d6x8 gp. Beastfriends have little interest in civilized matters such as
money, and seldom venture into towns.
