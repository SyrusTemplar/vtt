 </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The traditional druid is a guardian of the woodlands. Nature, however, is vast
and diverse; thus the druids detailed in this book might live their lives
protecting jungle rain forests, arctic tundra, or even the subterranean Underdark.
As a result, several distinct branches of druid are presented here, each
essentially a new subclass built around the basic concept of the druid class. As a
player, choose your druidic branch right after deciding to play a druid character.
