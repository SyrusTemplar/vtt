<P></P>
 True neutral, the most misunderstood of all alignments, often causes problems
for players. One common mistake is for neutral characters, such as druids, to
seek a balance by deliberately acting chaotic evil one day and lawful good the
next. Such behavior makes characters unpredictable, and the cumulative effect
promotes chaos more than anything else.
<P></P>
 Druids consider each alignment equally valid in a cosmic sense. They try to
remain nonjudgmental and uncommitted to any specific moral, legal, or
philosophical system beyond the basic tenets of the druidic order. Because a druid's main
charges--plants, animals, and the health of the planetary ecology--essentially
lack alignment or ethos, the character feels free to use almost any means
necessary to protect them.
<P></P>
 <A HREF="../PHB/DD01515.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01515.html">Chapter 4</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> of the <I>Player's Handbook</I> discusses alignments in a general sense; the druidic order works to maintain
the natural balance among these alignments. (See &quot;Keeper of the Balance&quot; later
in this chapter.) However, druids do realize that most individuals
actions--including their own--will not prove significant to the cosmic balance. The druid
sees the friction between alignments as the driving force in the world. Although
most druids personally may <I>prefer</I> to live among good people, they recognize that the existence of evil keeps
intelligent beings from stagnating.
<P></P>
 Despite their neutral status, druids don't resent being pulled into the
struggle between alignments. Neutral individuals do <I>not</I> lack interest, ambition, or passion--they value their own well-being and that
of friends and loved ones. They may struggle passionately on behalf of
themselves and others, as well as feel a compassion blanketing everything that makes
up the Nature they swear to protect. Never doubt that druids will act for their
own goals and the Order's.
<P></P>
 For example, the druid Rebecca has no philosophical objection to helping a
group of lawful good paladins and clerics defeat an evil dragon--if they can
demonstrate a good reason. She won't agree to kill the dragon merely &quot;because it is
evil.&quot; But, she might help if the dragon had harmed or threatened her friends
or a forest or village under her protection. She might also offer assistance
simply because she realizes the danger of living near a powerful and unpredictably
evil creature inclined to wreak havoc upon the natural surroundings. Finally,
she might join the party in return for a pledge that the members aid her in
protecting a wilderness area from those who would exploit it--or in order to get
treasure and magical items to do the job on her own.
<P></P>
 Clearly, playing a druid true to alignment is no easy task. The character must
consider carefully all the variables in a situation before acting. Remember
that, when faced with a tough decision, a druid usually stands behind the
solution that best serves Nature <I>in the long run.</I> So, Rebecca could have an equally valid reason to join a band of evil
adventurers hunting a lawful good dragon as she has to join a good party hunting an
evil dragon. Although a gold or silver dragon is unlikely to threaten Rebecca or
her sacred grove, she might wish to use its treasure to purchase equipment to
fight a greater threat or win the trust of an evil party she can use for her own
ends.
<P></P>
 Of course, druids understand that others may not take so pragmatic a view.
Rebecca knows a party of adventurers wouldn't be pleased to find she has stymied
its efforts. Alignment struggles constitute just another aspect of Nature, so
Rebecca would never seek to stop the members of a party from continuing the
struggle unless she deems it harmful to her own interests or those of the force she
worships and safeguards.
<P></P>
 A druid allied with a party of adventurers usually goes along with the party's
actions unless they threaten trees, crops, wild plants, and other things the
druid holds sacred. At the same time, the character needs a reason for joining a
party--often something as simple as a desire to gain the experience and power
needed to become a more effective guardian of Nature.
<P></P>
 Druids tend to react nonjudgmentally toward other races. With the possible
exception of undead, they feel that every race and species has its place in the
world. For instance, a druid recognizes most orcs as evil and cruel. The
character might not enjoy the company of orcs, but doesn't consider this feeling an
excuse to exterminate the entire race. Conflict between orcs and humans is the way
of the world, some druids say. They point out that orcs live a harsher
existence than humans, often dwelling in the deadly subterranean world. And, while the
average human may be less cruel than the average orc, mankind is capable of
greater evil through superior organization and civilization.
<P></P>
 Druids who stray from their alignment or cease to follow the tenets of the
Order lose major sphere spell access and granted powers until they make atonement.
In addition, the circle's great druid may place any subordinate druid under
the ban as a temporal punishment for such violations.
