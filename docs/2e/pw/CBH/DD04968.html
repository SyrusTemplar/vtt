<P></P>
 <B>Specialty:</B> Elven Spell Singer.
<P></P>
 <B>Qualifications: </B>Only elves and half-elves can become Minstrels. Elves can advance up to 15th
level as Minstrels, while half-elves are limited to 12th level.
<P></P>
 <B>Description:</B> Of all musicians in the world, none can play as purely as an elf. Minstrels
spend their entire lives seeking musical perfection. Of course, the definition
of perfection differs from one culture to the next. Elves believe that music
should be simple, pure, beautiful, and natural. Furthermore, those who listen
should become lost in the music, and their spirits should transcend their bodies to
ride upon the sweet flow of glittering notes.
<P></P>
 Elves are a very magical race, and this is especially true of Minstrels. It is
said that Minstrels cast spells by the simple strumming of an instrument.
<P></P>
 <B>Role:</B> Within elven society, Minstrels are regarded as nobles. Minstrel groups
perform during annual festivals for the enjoyment of all, and kings invite them to
dine in exchange for an evening's song. Outside their own culture, elven
Minstrels are looked upon with envy, distrust, and some fear.
<P></P>
 Elven Minstrels occasionally adventure out into the world. Some seek
life-experience to heighten the quality of their music. Others simply wander, relishing
the sensation of freedom that inspires their songs. A few Minstrels seek to
purge themselves of some impure act or event.
<P></P>
 <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Minstrels train to be great musicians all their lives. They do not spend the
time necessary to learn a secondary skill. Thus, Minstrels have no secondary
skills.
<P></P>
 <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Elven Minstrels are limited to the following weapon proficiencies: blowgun,
bow (any), dagger, dart, hand axe, javelin, knife, quarterstaff, sling, spear,
staff sling, long and short swords, and the trident.
<P></P>
 <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Bonuses: Musical Instrument, Reading/Writing, Singing, Spellcraft. Suggested:
Ancient History, Artistic Ability, Craft Instrument, Etiquette, Heraldry,
Local History, Poetry.
<P></P>
 <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Minstrels can wear only leather armor, padded armor, or elven chain mail.
Even studded leather is considered too harsh for a Minstrel to don.
<P></P>
 <B>Special Benefits:</B> 
<P></P>
 <I>Special Resistance:</I> Elven Minstrels gain a +2 saving throw bonus against all magical effects
based on music. If the attack does not allow a saving throw, they receive a normal
saving throw, anyway.
<P></P>
 <I>Spell Singing:</I> Minstrels are some of the few beings still in existence who know the ancient
art of spell singing. Some sages claim that magic was originally released into
the Prime Material plane by an ancient master musician. These sages maintain
that music is the true catalyst for ultimate sorcery. Whether this is true or
not, it is a fact that elven Minstrels cast spells through their music.
<P></P>
 Minstrels cannot cast spells in the typical manner. When a spell calls for a
somatic component, they must play an instrument. Likewise, they must sing when a
spell requires a verbal component.
<P></P>
 Material components must be carried on the Minstrel's person in a specially
prepared bag (made from deer leather). The Minstrel need not reach into the bag
or manipulate the material components. When the spell is cast, the components
simply vanish from within the bag. If the bag does not contain the required
components, the spell does not function.
<P></P>
 Not all instruments can be used for spell singing. First of all, if a spell
requires a verbal component (singing), only those instruments that leave the
Minstrel's mouth free can be used. This eliminates most of the wind instruments. If
the spell requires a somatic component, the instrument must support numerous,
complex hand manipulations (as is true of any stringed instrument). This
eliminates gongs, cymbals, drums, and most of the percussion family. Thus, elven
Minstrels typically carry stringed instruments. Keyboard instruments would work but
are generally too bulky to carry around.
<P></P>
 Spells that normally emanate from the caster's hands instead radiate from the
spell singer's instrument. Thus, <I>burning hands</I> produces its 120-degree arc of flame from the instrument (and not the
Minstrel's hands).
<P></P>
 Spell singing is in all other ways just like typical spell casting.
<P></P>
 <I>Influence Reactions:</I> This ability works just like the True Bard's ability of the same name.
However, a Minstrel can sing or play an instrument in an attempt to influence
reactions. And, if the Minstrel does both, he can adjust the reactions by two levels
instead of the typical one. This is not cumulative with the crowd working
proficiency or the bard's reputation.
<P></P>
 <I>Counter Song:</I> The last special benefit of the Minstrel is identical to the True Bard's
counter song ability in every way.
<P></P>
 <B>Special Hindrances:</B> Without an instrument, Minstrels cannot cast spells that require somatic
components.
