<P></P>
 <B>Specialty:</B> Linguist/Orator.
<P></P>
 <B>Qualifications: </B>Standard ability scores. Demihumans can become Heralds of up to 6th level.
<P></P>
 <B>Introduction:</B> <I>Hello, my name is Bard, James Bard, and I'm a Herald working for His Majesty,
the king.
<P></P>
 My duties are of the utmost importance to the king and to the continued
vitality of the kingdom, for I am secretly in charge of the King's private
men-at-arms and personal bodyguards. If the king's life is in danger, I am responsible
for ensuring his safety.
<P></P>
 My public image is one of party-goer, ladies' man, and general royal busybody.
I frequent all the best parties in town. The king often ensures that I am
invited. At these functions, I meet important people and use my fantastic
communication skills and intellect to uncover potential plots against the throne.
<P></P>
 When I'm not partying, the public finds me at the castle gate. When a party
comes to the castle, I use my knowledge to identify their Herald or banner and
call out their name, such as: &quot;Duke Amenga and entourage from Castle Peledge.&quot;
This is a useful service, but my real purpose is to identify these visitors,
assess their potential threat to the king, and act accordingly.
<P></P>
</I> <I>Enough talk, I must be off to chat with that strange-looking man entering the
gates over there.</I> 
<P></P>
 <B>Description:</B> Heralds make their living by uncovering hidden truths. If a royal family has
a closely guarded secret, a Herald will undoubtedly discover it. In the
struggle for land and power among kingdoms, the Herald is a key force. A good Herald
knows who is plotting against his king and why.
<P></P>
 Heralds are confident and well-versed in matters of social etiquette. They
often gather their information at royal events, such as balls and other
celebrations. They are often mistaken for nobility; thus, they can easily make their way
past guards. Heralds dress in the latest and most expensive fashions of the
day. They prefer silk and bright colors. Members of the opposite sex are often
attracted to Heralds by their self-confident manner and slight arrogance.
<P></P>
 One thing is certain, Heralds are some of the most competent communicators
around. They can speak dozens of languages, understand sophisticated words, locate
a person's home village by his dialect, and can read almost everything they
get their hands on.
<P></P>
 <B>Role:</B> There are two types of Heralds. One travels from place to place, relating
current events across the land. They sell their tales of travel and the news they
learn to those who will listen. Most medieval commoners cannot read or write,
so it is up to such Heralds to relate local events.
<P></P>
 The other type of Herald secretly serves a king. It is the royal Herald's duty
to uncover plots against the king and royal family. The royal Herald is quick
witted and fast talking. Heralds of this stature often have a reputation that
precedes them. They are recognized and feared by their foes. Thus, they must
occasionally deal with assassination attempts at inconvenient times (for instance,
a <I>delayed blast fireball</I> under the bed). Royal courts often employ them to preside over jousting
tournaments, announce the arrival of important foreign envoys, and for personal
counsel.
<P></P>
 Heralds turn to the adventuring life for several reasons. Primary among them
are the fantastic stories that can be related from such ventures. &quot;News&quot; has a
very broad meaning in the campaign world, and tales of a daring band of heroes
braving unknown horrors not only qualifies, but often draws a larger crowd than
local gossip.
<P></P>
 The royal Herald might be sent by his king on an undercover fact-finding
mission-for instance, to investigate a rumor that Zhentil Keep is secretly funding
an orc uprising in the south. Often, a Herald's communication skills will prove
invaluable on such quests.
<P></P>
 <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Groom, Hunter, Jeweler, Limner/Painter, Scribe.
<P></P>
 <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Heralds are not restricted in this area.
<P></P>
 <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonuses:</I> Etiquette, Heraldry, Local History, Reading/Writing. <I>Suggested:</I> Languages (ancient or modern), Musical Instrument (horn family). At least
half of a Herald's nonweapon proficiencies must be spent in learning languages.
<P></P>
 <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Standard.
<P></P>
 <B>Special Benefits:</B> 
<P></P>
 <I>Identify Rumors:</I> Heralds are always aware of their surroundings and have picked up the skills
necessary to stay atop local events. Any time rumors are generated for player
characters, Heralds learn twice as many as a normal character. Heralds are also
able to determine the validity of a rumor. A Charisma check is rolled; if it
succeeds, the Herald knows whether the rumor is true or false. Even if a rumor
table isn't included in a given adventure, the Dungeon Master should make up at
least one rumor per three levels of the Herald and inform him of the rumors at
the adventure's onset.
<P></P>
 <I>Local Lore:</I> After snooping about an inhabited area, a Herald is able to learn who the
important people are, what most of the buildings are used for, the quality of
certain establishments,<I> etc</I>. It takes a Herald one day per 1,000 inhabitants to gain a good information
base. Of course, a Herald could concentrate on a specific quarter of town or
neighborhood and accomplish the task much faster.
<P></P>
 Once a Herald is done scouting, he can recall the name of an important
official if he rolls a successful Intelligence check. If the check is successful with
a -2 penalty, he can identify the person on sight. This roll can also be used
if the Herald player wants to know other local lore, such as where to go for the
best food in town, what neighborhoods are dangerous at night, what time the
city watch rotates, or which local sage is said to be most reliable. If the check
is a 20, the Herald believes he knows the desired information, but the Dungeon
Master actually makes up some false tale for the player.
<P></P>
 This ability must be carefully judged by the Dungeon Master. Penalties should
be applied based upon the information's local significance. It is unlikely that
a Herald will know the name of a typical citizen in a large city (a -10
penalty might be appropriate). However, the name of the king's horse is likely a
well-known fact (no penalty).
<P></P>
 <I>Basal Communication:</I> As stated above, Heralds are master linguists. In fact, they can often
communicate with races that are of low Intelligence or better and have a spoken
language, even if the Herald does not speak that language. The Herald incorporates
bits and pieces of fundamental root languages, certain universal gestures, and
common expressions to get his meaning across. For the Herald to perform such
difficult communication, the &quot;listener&quot; must be within ten feet, clearly visible,
and there must be no distractions (including combat).
<P></P>
 Success is determined by succeeding with a read languages roll (even though
the communication is rarely in written form). A separate roll is needed to send
or receive ideas. Thus, it is possible for a Herald to understand a being, but
be unable to communicate his own ideas (or vice versa).
<P></P>
 <I>Persuade Crowd:</I> A Herald can affect the mood of a crowd by telling them true (or slightly
altered) local rumors and news. The Herald must be able to speak the crowd's
language to use this ability. To determine a crowd's mood or opinion on a given
topic, use <A HREF="../DMG/DD00564.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../DMG/DD00564.html">Table 59</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> in the <I>DMG</I> .
<P></P>
 After 1d10 minutes, those listening to the Herald's words are allowed a saving
throw vs. paralyzation, with a -1 penalty per three levels of the Herald.
Those who fail have their reactions adjusted one level in favor of the Herald's
opinion. Those who succeed have their reactions adjusted one level in the opposite
direction.
<P></P>
 A Herald could attempt to persuade a crowd not to eat at the Skinned Dog
Tavern until dragon eggs are back on the menu, to cast stones at the cruel teamster
Tornack, or to go and plunder the local granaries. Of course, reactions can be
altered only one level by this method. For example, if everyone is indifferent
to the fact that Tornack whips his horses cruelly, the Herald will at most
persuade them to be cautious about using the teamster's wagons to haul their goods.
<P></P>
 <B>Special Hindrances:</B> None.
