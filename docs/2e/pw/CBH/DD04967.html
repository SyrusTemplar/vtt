 <B>Specialty:</B> Chanter/Time Lord.
<P></P>
 <B>Qualifications:</B> Chanters must have a Constitution of 13 or more. However, they have no
Intelligence qualification (unlike most bards). Only dwarves can become Chanters and
they are limited to 15th level in advancement.
<P></P>
 <B>Description:</B> Many times have other races attempted to analyze the phenomenal success of
the dwarven race; their uncanny ability to survive incredible hardship, their
dogged nature, the immense amount of work they perform, and their successful
military campaigns. Always the analysis comes up short.
<P></P>
 Much of the success of the dwarven race can be attributed to their Chanters.
Throughout the ages, these special dwarves have passed along the secrets of
their kind. They have learned the many mining, forging, marching, and war chants of
their elders. Other races dismiss these chants as simple entertainment, but it
is the power of the dwarven Chanter that has built the steel in the dwarven
spine. If a skilled Chanter is present, dwarves can mine through solid granite
for months without growing bored or lax.
<P></P>
 Some chants are purely vocal, but many require the use of a percussion
instrument to keep the rhythm steady. Chanters often employ drums, gongs, gourds, and
so on.
<P></P>
 <B>Role:</B> The secret of chanting has been kept hidden from outsiders. Thus, Chanters
are heavily guarded and highly regarded within the dwarven kingdom. Of all
dwarven organizations, the Chanter's College is one of the most powerful. Even kings
have been overruled in the past by mighty Chanters threatening to cease their
rhythmic songs. Without the Chanters, the dwarven communities would slow to a
crawl and their underworld enemies would push them from their homes.
<P></P>
 Adventuring Chanters are a great boon to any party and are even more useful in
large-scale battles. They are the pace-setters and the very heartbeat of those
around them.
<P></P>
 <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Armorer, Jeweler, Mason, Miner, Weaponsmith.
<P></P>
 <B>Weapon Proficiencies: </B>Chanters often use their weapons to beat upon an instrument, a rock, or even
the ground. Because of this, they generally become proficient only in blunt
weapons or stick-like weapons.
<P></P>
 The following weapons are available to Chanters: club, flails (all), maces
(all), javelin, morning star, quarterstaff, sling, spear, staff sling, and the
warhammer.
<P></P>
 <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonuses:</I> Crowd Working, Musical Instrument, Chanting, Spellcraft. <I>Suggested:</I> Ancient History, Appraising, Armorer, Blacksmithing, Cobbling, Craft
Instrument, Engineering, Gem Cutting, Languages (ancient), Languages (modern), Local
History, Mining, Mountaineering, Pottery, Stonemasonry, Weaponsmithing.
<P></P>
 <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Chanters can wear any armor except for plate; plate mail, bronze plate, field
plate, and full plate are all forbidden. They cannot employ shields.
<P></P>
 <B>Special Benefits:</B> 
<P></P>
 <I>Counter Chant:</I> Like all dwarven demi-bards, dwarven Chanters gain the counter spell ability
defined earlier. In order to counter a spell, a Chanter must voice the proper
counter chant.
<P></P>
 In addition to the typical counter spell ability, Chanters can actually
&quot;attack&quot; certain spells. A Chanter can walk up to a wall of force (assuming he has
previously learned the spell), begin counter chanting, and if he succeeds with
his &quot;chance to learn spells&quot; roll, he actually cancels the entire spell for a
number of rounds equal to his level. If the roll is equal to or less than the
dwarf's level, the cancellation is permanent.
<P></P>
 <I>War Chant:</I> Dwarven war chants are legendary. There is nothing quite so powerful and
terrifying as watching a mass of heavily armed and grim-looking dwarves advancing
and chanting. Their deep voices, all booming in unison, often destroy enemy
morale and put fear into the heart of many a brave foe.
<P></P>
 When a Chanter starts a war chant, he can affect up to ten dwarves per level
or one non-dwarf per level. To be affected, the recipients must join in the
chant (it doesn't matter if they have ever heard it or not). After 1d10 rounds of
chanting, the power of the chant begins to take effect. A chanting band gains a
+1 bonus to initiative, a +2 bonus to resist surprise, and a +2 bonus to all
morale checks. Those combating a chanting group suffer a -1 initiative penalty
and a -2 penalty to all morale checks. The bonuses for a member of the Chanter's
party last for as long as both the individual and the Chanter are chanting; the
penalties for the opponents last as long as the Chanter keeps up the chant.
<P></P>
 <I>Timing Chant:</I> The real power of the Chanter is the numerous timing chants he knows. These
chants function similarly to war chants in that they take 1d10 rounds to take
effect, and last while both the Chanter and affected are chanting. But the
results are quite different.
<P></P>
 There are four common timing chants: one each for mining, forging, marching,
and general labor. The purpose of each chant is to increase productivity, soothe
the mind, prevent boredom, stave off sleep, and support resolve. All timing
chants must be accompanied by a percussion instrument.
<P></P>
 Timing chants by Chanters increase speed or production by 5% per level of the
Chanter. A top-level (15th) Chanter can get 75% more work out of a group than
it would normally produce.
<P></P>
 Of course, such rapid work does take a physical toll, even if the mind is
willing. Each hour that a person works under the effects of a timing chant, he must
roll a Constitution check. A failed check results in the loss of 1d4 hit
points. This damage is temporary and is recoverable at the rate of 1 point per hour
of rest or sleep. Anyone reduced to 0 hit points in this way falls over from
exhaustion; death results unless a Constitution check succeeds.
<P></P>
 <I>Trance:</I> Obviously, if a mining crew's Chanter falls over from lack of sleep or
exhaustion, the timing chant will cease. For this reason, Chanters have learned to
place themselves into a self-induced trance. This takes 1d10 turns of
uninterrupted meditation, during which the Chanter grumbles the words to some ancient
meditative script. Once in a trance state, the Chanter will begin some set
activity: chanting, combat, marching, working, studying, <I>etc</I>. 
<P></P>
 The trance state causes the Chanter to shut down all of his being (mind and
body) that is not needed for the activity at hand. An entranced Chanter can
maintain this set activity until a predetermined circumstance occurs. For example,
the Chanter may have said to himself, &quot;Awake when there are no more goblins on
the field of battle,&quot; &quot;Awake when we reach the Kingdom of Thorbardin,&quot; or &quot;Awake
after 1,000 strikes of the great drum.&quot;
<P></P>
 Trances are not lightly entered, as they are very dangerous to the character.
During a trance state, the Chanter does not drink, eat, rest, or sleep. Every
time that one of these activities should normally occur, the entranced Chanter
must roll a Constitution check. A failed check results in the loss of hit
points: 1d8 for drink, 1d3 for food, 1d4 for rest, and 1d8 for sleep. Furthermore,
the only known way to interrupt a trance before the predetermined circumstance
occurs is to reduce the Chanter to 0 hit points (<I>i.e.,</I> knock him unconscious or kill him).
<P></P>
 Damage resulting from food and water deprivation must be healed as if it were
combat damage, but damage resulting from lack of rest or sleep is temporary and
can be regained at the rate of 1 point per hour of rest or sleep. If reduced
to 0 hit points by sleep or rest deprivation, the entranced Chanter falls
unconscious; death results unless a Constitution check succeeds. However, if all
damage is a result of food and water deprivation, the Chanter dies regardless of
the check result.
<P></P>
 <B>Special Hindrances:</B> Like all dwarven demi-bards, Chanters do not gain the bard's spell abilities.
Nor do they gain the 10th-level bard ability to use any written magical item.
