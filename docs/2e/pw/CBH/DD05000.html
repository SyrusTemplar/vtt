Poland, Russia, Greece, Persia, China, India, and the Balkan countries.
<P></P>
 <B>Balalaika:</B> This is a three-string Russian triangular guitar. It comes in various sizes,
the largest resting upon the ground when played.
<P></P>

brass or steel strings, and is plucked with a quill. By 1550 this was known as
the cittern.
<P></P>
 <B>Cittern:</B> A member of the guitar family, the cittern is shaped like a fig, with a flat
back, fretted fingerboard, and wire strings (usually four pairs). It is a

 <B>Clarsach:</B> An ancient small harp of the Scottish highlands.
<P></P>
 <B>Clavecin:</B> French harpsichord.

<P></P>
 <B>Clavicembalo:</B> This is the Italian harpsichord and is often abbreviated as &quot;cembalo.&quot; The
word derives from latin &quot;clavis&quot;-a key, and &quot;cembalo&quot;-a dulcimer, which describes
the instrument-it's a keyed dulcimer.
<P></P>
 <B>Clavichord:</B> This keyboard instrument is small, often just an oblong box placed on the
table. It can have its own legs and stand on the floor, but this was a later
development. Sound is made when a small piece of metal hits a string, producing a
soft, quiet tone.
<P></P>
 <B>Clogs:</B> Wooden shoes.

The membrane is beaten with sticks or the hands.
<P></P>
 The exception is the friction drum, which has its skin pierced by a stick or
