     Only humans can be dual-classed. Dual-classed humans can use any kit that the
Dungeon Master allows in his campaign.
<P></P>
 In order to switch from the bard to another character class, the character
must have a 15 or better in both Dexterity and Charisma and a 17 or better in the
prime requisite of the new class.
<P></P>
 If the character is of another class and wishes to pick up the bard class, he
must have a 15 or better in the prime requisite of his other class and a 17 or
better in both Dexterity and Charisma.
