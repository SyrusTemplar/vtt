 So what is it that makes bards such fantastic entertainers? Why is a bard with
a 15 proficiency in musical instrument any better than a fighter, priest, or
wizard with a 15? What makes bards so special? The answer to these questions and
other questions are found in this section.
<P></P>
 Unlike all the other character classes, bards are performers. This is a
special trait common to all bards. There is no die roll bonus associated with this
trait, it isn't listed under any kit's special benefits, and it isn't a
proficiency.
<P></P>
 Being a true performer is so fundamental to the bard character class that it
isn't listed at all. Instead, this fact influences almost every aspect of the
character class. It is because of their performing nature that bards gain special
abilities with music, song, poems, juggling, and so on (based upon the kit).
Being performers is as fundamental to the bard class as being combatants is to
the warrior class. It is the one element common to all the bard kits, the
element that defines the essence of being a bard.
<P></P>
 Back to the example of musical instrument proficiency. It is true that a
warrior with a proficiency of 16 in musical instruments is able to play more
precisely and more accurately than a bard with a 15 or less. However, playing music
technically correct is only half the picture. Since bards are performers, they
understand numerous hidden aspects relating to music. They are more in tune with
their audience and adapt their performances appropriately. Bards are more aware
of mood, feeling, tone, and the dramatic effects of stretching the music
beyond the technicalities of precise playing.
<P></P>
 A warrior who is a master musician (proficiency 20) can play the most
complicated piece of music exactly as written. Moreover, every time he plays the piece,
it sounds just as it did the last time. But a bard with only a 15 proficiency
can entertain audiences far more successfully. Every performance is custom
tailored to the occasion and the audience. The bard takes the liberty of
interpreting the song and won't simply repeat it.
