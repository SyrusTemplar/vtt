     Note that some category names, such as &quot;Bagpipes,&quot; are also the names of
specific instruments. These categories have a gold piece cost and weight in pounds
listed next to them so you can buy the instrument of that name. However,
purchasing a generic bagpipe does not mean that you have both a dudy and zampogna--you
have only a generic bagpipe.
