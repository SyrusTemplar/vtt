 This spell works in all ways like the 2nd-level wizard spell <I>magic mouth</I>, except as follows.
<P></P>
 When this spell is cast, the mouth is endowed with the bard's current
knowledge, Intelligence, and personality. When the predetermined event occurs that
activates the mouth, it converses as if the bard were actually there. For example,
the mouth might say, &quot;Who goes there?&quot; and wait for a reply. If the visitors
announce their names, it could go on to say, &quot;Tarnak, please proceed to the music
room, while the rest wait in the sitting room.&quot;
<P></P>
 The mouth lasts until the conversation is over.
<P></P>
 Although the mouth can be set to activate due to a visual stimulus (<I>i.e.,</I> activate if anyone wearing a green feather approaches the castle gate), once
triggered, it reacts only to sounds and speech. Also note that the mouth and
the bard are not linked in any way. Once cast, the mouth's knowledge is set and
will never change. Thus, if a bard is extremely angry at Tarnak when he casts an <I>improved magic mouth</I>, the mouth will remain in a state of anger, even if the bard and Tarnak have
reconciled.
