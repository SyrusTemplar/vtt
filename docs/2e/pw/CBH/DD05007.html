     Welcome to the mind of a bard. To play a bard, you must think like a bard. He
is a dreamer, a romantic, and a part-time philosopher. A bard wants to be a
master of all skills. He wants to try everything, know everything, and be
everything. Unfortunately, most bards are mortal. The constraints of mortality keep a
bard moving from one profession and activity to the next. He fears that if he
spends too much time in one place or doing one thing, he will miss out on
something else.
<P></P>
 Pragmatists claim that bards suffer from &quot;green pasture syndrome.&quot; This
syndrome gets its name from cows. They constantly poke their heads over or through
fences in an attempt to eat the grass on the other side. Farmers laugh at their
livestock because the grass in their own pasture is often greener than the grass
on the other side. But the cows have green pasture syndrome and always seem to
think that things are better somewhere else.
<P></P>
 Bards are easily excited about new developments, upcoming events, and change
in general. If things aren't changing, they become bored very quickly. Thus,
bards are not ones to hold down long-time jobs. When they do take jobs, they work
at them at a breakneck pace at first. Then, as the job becomes routine, their
pace slows and they spend more time pondering the future and where it will take
them next.
<P></P>
 All of this is also true for adventuring bards. They want to get going, attack
now, stop listening at every door, rush forward and meet life head on. Bards
don't always select the most effective spells or the most advantageous
proficiencies. Instead, they select the most dramatic, the most fun, those that can be
used in unique situations. A flashy spell, such as <I>color spray</I>, is always preferable to a boring one, such as<I> hold portal</I> or <I>sleep .</I>
<P></P>
 Bards love crowds and love to be around people. They tend to have many
acquaintances but few close friends. Some bards actually push away those who try to
get too close. A binding friendship or relationship is like a root: It attempts
to plant the bard in one place and lock him into the relationship. This is far
more than just undesirable to most bards-it is downright frightening. Bards
enjoy their freedom and don't want anything to jeopardize it.
<P></P>
 Of all the character classes, none are as carefree and lighthearted as bards.
These characters rarely own more than they can carry. To bards, all the world
is their home and their imagination is the only limit to their aspirations.
Although they can be profoundly moved by others' plights, bards recover quickly
from any sadness they might feel. Often they deal with problems by leaving them
behind and traveling on to some greener pasture.
<P></P>
 If you are going to play a bard, remember at least this one rule of thumb:
Your character's main goal is to, &quot;move on and experience all that there is.&quot;
