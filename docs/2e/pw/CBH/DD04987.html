 When this spell is cast, audience members are magically conjured. Each round
1d4 people enter the room or area in a normal manner. (They actually appear just
outside the room when no one is looking.) This continues for a number of
rounds equal to the caster's level.
<P></P>
 The audience contains a combination of races, gender, and social class
appropriate to the occasion.
<P></P>
 Instant audience members act in every way like any other members of the
audience. They walk around during intermission, talk, eat snacks, and so on. However,
they always evade questions about their past, their history, or current
events, as they have no past, no history, and have no idea as to what is going on in
the world outside of the room.
<P></P>
 Instant audience members are strictly noncombative and never attack or cast
spells (although they can be bullies or braggarts if that is appropriate). If one
suffers even a single point of damage, he instantly vanishes along with all of
his items (including items no longer on his body, such as clothes that he hung
in the linen closet).
<P></P>
 Once the performance ends, instant audience members leave in an appropriate
manner and vanish as soon as they are out of view.
<P></P>
 If the audience is treated in an inappropriate way (as determined by the DM),
the spell instantly ends. For example, an audience could be summoned to watch a
combat, but if the audience is used as a human shield, it vanishes.
<P></P>
 The material components are a small collection of the items carried by the
appropriate audience (a gold coin, a piece of fine fabric, a snuff box, <I>etc</I>.). These are tossed into a bag that contains at least one live mouse. The
mouse is not destroyed, but vanishes during the spell to reappear somewhere in the
room after the spell ends.
