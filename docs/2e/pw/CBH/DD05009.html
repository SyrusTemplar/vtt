 So how good is a bard's performance? It depends partly upon his skill and
level, but most importantly, upon his reputation. The songs of a famous skald
hailing from the icy north are met with great anticipation and acceptance. An
infamous blade known for his many assassinations draws just as large a crowd to his
daring performances of weaponry.
<P></P>
 Reputation is an intangible aspect of any bard. As the bard travels the path
of life, his reputation can grow into that of a great singing hero, it can be
slandered so everyone thinks the bard is a cowardly oaf, or the bard's reputation
can become an infamous cloak with which to frighten watchmen and thrill the
crowds.
<P></P>
 When you first generate your character, his reputation is based upon that of
his family. From there, events and the way the bard is role-played continually
adjust his reputation. Read on for the events that define a bard's reputation.
