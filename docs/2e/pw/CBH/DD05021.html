    Acquiring, gaining, and losing patrons is based upon the optional
reputation system presented in this handbook. If this system isn't used, substitute the
bard's level for his reputation.
<P></P>
 Once a bard becomes well-known (reputation 6) he gains his first patrons. To
determine how many patrons the bard initially gains, roll 1d20 a number of times
equal to the bard's maximum number of henchmen (a function of Charisma). Every
result equal to or below the bard's reputation indicates that one more patron
is acquired.
<P></P>
 Note that patrons are not henchmen and do not count against this number.
