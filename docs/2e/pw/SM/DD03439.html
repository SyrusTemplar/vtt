Paladins, Rangers, and Minor Spellcasters  </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Minor spellcasters include those characters whose primary abilities lie in
other areas—paladins, rangers, and any other characters who gain minor magical
abilities at higher levels. For these characters, spells are only a small part of
their repertoire of abilities, often acquired late in their adventuring careers.
<P></P>
 In many campaigns, the magical powers of minor spellcasters tend to be
ignored. Since they have to wait longer than the wizards and priests of a campaign to
gain their spell powers, minor spellcasters only have access to spells that
their enemies can easily counter. When a 10th-level paladin can cure 20 points of
damage by <I>laying on hands</I>, his <I>cure light wounds </I>seems insignificant, and his <I>bless </I>spell only takes his adjusted THAC0 from a 5 or so to a 4. The opponents that
an 11th-level ranger is likely to be facing will have an easy time making their
saves against an <I>entangle </I>spell. The spell powers of minor spellcasters are far more important to a
character operating alone or looking for spells that support or enhance his
abilities.
