 The concept of knockdowns was introduced in the <I>Player’s Option: <A HREF="../CT/DD02462.html"></A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="../CT/DD02462.html">Combat &amp; Tactics</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><I> </I>rulebook. Knockdowns are hits that send the victim flying or put him on the
ground, knocking him prone. The ability to cause a knockdown varies from weapon
to weapon, and the larger the target, the more resistant he is to knockdown
results. Very few attacks have the power to put a frost giant flat on his back!
<P></P>
 While a club-wielding giant or a powerful barbarian obviously has the
potential to take an opponent off his feet, many spells also have the ability to drive
a victim to the ground with tremendous force, shock, or concussion. In some
cases, spell energy may cause knockdowns through spasms, intense pain, or
physiological shock as well as sheer impact energy.

 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Knockdown Die: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The likelihood of a weapon (or a spell) to cause a knockdown is governed by
the size of the knockdown die. Any time a character suffers damage from a spell,
the caster may roll a knockdown die to see if there is a chance for a
knockdown. If the number rolled on the knockdown die is higher than the victim’s
knockdown number, he must roll a saving throw vs. death magic or fall down.
<P></P>
 Usually, being knocked down forces the character to spend his next action or
attack standing again. Standing is treated as moving half the character’s normal
movement rating, so a knocked-down fighter could choose to stand in the
following round and still receive his normal allotment of melee attacks, while a
knocked-down archer who stood up would have to fire at 1/2 his normal rate of fire.
(See <B>What You Can Do in One Round</B>, page 122 of the <A HREF="../PHB/DD01684.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01684.html">PHB</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> .)
<P></P>
 While a character is on the ground, he is especially vulnerable to attack.
Anyone attacking the knocked-down character gains a +4 bonus to hit, and the prone
character may not apply his Dexterity adjustment (if any) to his Armor Class.
Obviously, it’s worth the time to stand up again!

Size is the most important characteristic here, although a character with a good
saving throw will avoid many knockdowns regardless of his size. See <A HREF="DD03583.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03583.html">Table 43</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> : Knockdown Numbers by Size.

 <I>Oromonos isn’t done with that guard yet. Since the </I>shocking grasp <I>didn’t deter the fellow, Oromonos throws a </I>lightning bolt <I>at him at point-blank range. The </I>lightning bolt <I>has a knockdown die of d12 (we’ll discuss knockdown die sizes for particular
spells in a moment), and Oromonos rolls an 8 with the d12 while he’s rolling his
damage for the spell. Since the guard is a human (size M) and therefore
knocked down on a 7 or better, he must now make a saving throw vs. death magic or hit
the turf. Although the fellow does save against the lightning bolt itself, he
blows his knockdown save and winds up on the ground, wondering what hit him.
