 Another unusual attack form is acid. Very few spells make use of acid as a
weapon, although a fair number of monsters have acid-based attacks, including the
ankheg, the black dragon, and some slimes, puddings, and oozes.

feet in diameter; the more acid, the larger the area affected. The fumes may
obscure missile and melee attacks at the DM’s option, creating a –1 penalty for
any creature trying to attack through the smoke and haze.

victim’s eyes, nose, and throat. If the DM desires, creatures within the cloud of
fumes must roll saving throws vs. death magic or suffer a –2 penalty to attack
rolls and Armor Class as long as they remain nearby. This means that a
character struck by <I>Melf’s acid arrow </I>may suffer combat penalties as well as damage from the spell.
