 This spell provides a priest of elemental air with the ability to conjure a
powerful column of wind that can bear his weight, permitting him to fly or glide
for long distances. If used from a high place such as a mountainside or tower,
the caster can glide a maximum horizontal distance of 20 feet per foot of
initial altitude—for example, if the priest used this spell and launched himself
from a hilltop 800 feet high, he could glide a maximum distance of 16,000 feet, or
about 3 miles.
<P></P>
 If <I>windborne </I>is cast by a priest on level ground, the initial gust carries him aloft to a
maximum altitude of 10 feet per caster level. From that point, he may then glide
10 feet per foot of initial altitude. For example, a 7th-level priest would
ascend to an altitude of 70 feet and thus be able to glide for a total horizontal
distance of 700 feet. He can choose to glide for a much shorter distance, but
never less than his initial altitude.
<P></P>
 While gliding, the priest moves at a rate of 15 (or about 450 feet) with a
maneuverability class of D. Each round, he drops between 20 and 40 feet. He can
choose to descend at a much more rapid pace, dropping up to 200 feet per round
without risk of a damaging impact upon landing. The caster doesn’t gain a mastery
of aerial combat with this spell and suffers a –2 penalty to his attack rolls
and Armor Class if he becomes involved in combat while gliding.
<P></P>
 The material component for this spell is the feather from a giant eagle .
