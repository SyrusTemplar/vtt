Wizard Characters  </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A player creating a wizard character has one basic decision to make when the
character is first rolled up— should his character specialize in a school of
magic, or should he remain a mage? A mage is equally capable in all schools of
magic and may freely learn and cast spells from any school. A specialist wizard
gains several important benefits when dealing with his own school, but loses
access to certain spells that belong to opposition schools.

character points in order to gain access to better weapons or protective equipment.

 All wizards may create magical potions or scrolls after reaching 9th level by
using the magical item creation rules in this book. (The alchemist and geometer
gain this ability earlier in their careers.) Wizards may also create other
types of magical items upon reaching 11th level. Any wizard may attempt to
research new spells, regardless of level.
