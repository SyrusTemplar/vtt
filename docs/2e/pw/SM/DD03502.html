Wise Women and Hedge Wizards
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Every village or hamlet has its own resident “witch” or “wizard,” or a person
who claims command of magical powers and knowledge of herbs, spells, and
charms. In a few cases, these characters are actually low-level magic-users, but more
often they’re fakes or charlatans. Most of these wise women or hedge wizards
are 0-level characters with the herbalism and healing proficiencies. They can
sell spell components from the herb, animal specimen, and common lists, although
they often have no idea what a particular herb or item might be good for.
<P></P>
 Wise women and hedge wizards may be capable of creating healing salves and
poultices, as described above. In addition, they can create minor charms or
fetishes. These are temporary magical items about as powerful as a typical <I>cantrip</I>. Good examples would include a “love amulet,” that raised the wearer’s
Charisma (Cha/Appearance) by 1 or 2 points, but only in the eyes of one particular
subject whose hair was used in the making of the charm; a charm that discouraged
mice or insects from entering a kitchen or pantry; or a small totem that
brought the user good luck (a +1 bonus) on his next saving throw against a specific
threat, such as fire, poison, or resisting mental spells. A charm costs anywhere
from 5 to 50 gold pieces, and retains its enchantment for 1 to 4 days.
