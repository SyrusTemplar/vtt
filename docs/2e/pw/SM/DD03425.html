 Known primarily for their love of nature and guardianship of the wilderness,
druids possess remarkable abilities in areas dealing with plants, animals,
weather, and the elements. Druids with a Wisdom and Charisma score of 16 or better
earn a 10% bonus to the experience they gain. Because of their views, druids
must be neutral in alignment.
<P></P>
 Except for a slight change in the spheres of access, druids keep all of the
abilities and powers listed in the <A HREF="../PHB/DD01489.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01489.html">PHB</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> . Druids have major access to all, animal, elemental, healing, plant, sun and
weather.

 Druids can only wear leather armor and use wooden shields. Their weapons are
limited to club, sickle, dart, spear, dagger, scimitar, sling, and staff. Aside
from written magical items as well as armor and weapons forbidden to druids,
this class can use all other magical items. Druids cannot turn undead. See the <A HREF="../PHB/DD01496.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01496.html">PHB</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> for details about how druids are organized.
