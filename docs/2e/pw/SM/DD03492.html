Material Spell Components  </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Even without a laboratory or a consecrated altar, priests and wizards often
find themselves in need of unusual or hard-to-find items for material components
in their spells. While many DMs do not require players to keep track of their
characters’ stocks of spell components, this can be a great test of a PC’s
resourcefulness and the source of many adventures. After all, merely <I>finding</I> a diamond worth 1,000 gp is quite an event for a low-level character, but
then the player has to decide whether to grind it into worthless powder for use in
a critical spell!
