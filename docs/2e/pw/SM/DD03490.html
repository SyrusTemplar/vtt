Materials and Decoration
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The altar, its decorations or trappings, and the preparations for the ceremony
of consecration cost at least 2,000 gp, above and beyond the cost for any
building or structures to house it. Generally, the altar must be built of whatever
materials seem appropriate; for a god of war, an altar made from the swords of
brave men, or the shields of fallen warriors, could be appropriate. A deity of
storms might require an altar built from a hundred-year-old oak split by
lightning. In any event, the altar should be of the finest workmanship possible.
Building an altar requires at least 2d4 weeks of the priest’s time and attention,
and the services of skilled masons, smiths, or woodworkers.
<P></P>
 In addition to the construction of the altar, the priest must also assemble
and prepare special incenses, ceremonial vestments, and other unusual materials.
This could cost anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 gp more, depending on the deity
involved. The priest may be able to borrow some of these materials from a large
temple of his own faith, which would reduce the cost by 50%.
