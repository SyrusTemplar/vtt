Optional Abilities
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> A customized specialty priest is constructed from the list of optional
abilities and restrictions below. A priest begins with 120 CPs to purchase abilities
and may gain additional CPs by taking limitations.
<P></P>
<A NAME="8e2b92e3"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Access to spheres (variable): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The priest must purchase each sphere of access with character points. He may
cast spells only from spheres he has access to and may only cast spells of 4th
level or higher if he has major access to a sphere. Normal cleric access costs
100 points; druid access costs 70 points; crusader access costs 55 points; monk
access costs 60 points; and shaman access costs 60 points. See <A HREF="DD03430.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03430.html">Table 6</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> : Access Costs.
<P></P>
<A NAME="00fbb09b"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Animal empathy (10): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This ability is similar to that of the ranger character class. If the priest
carefully approaches a natural animal, he can modify the animal’s reactions.
Domestic or nonhostile animals are befriended automatically, while wild animals or
those trained to attack must make a saving throw vs. rod, staff, or wand to
resist the priest’s overtures. The priest imposes a saving throw penalty of –1
per three experience levels (–1 at 1st to 3rd, –2 at 4th to 6th, and so on.) If
the animal fails to save, its reaction is shifted one category as the priest
chooses—for example, from hostile to threatening, or neutral to friendly.
<P></P>
<A NAME="ce770855"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Armor Class improvement (15): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The priest is trained in avoiding blows through timing and deception. His
natural Armor Class improves by one point at every even level (AC 9 at 2nd, 8 at
4th, 7 at 6th, and so on) to a maximum of AC 2. However, this ability is useless
if the priest wears any form of armor or magical devices which replace armor,
like <I>bracers of defense</I>.
<P></P>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Casting time reduction (5): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The casting time of the priest’s spells is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.
<P></P>
<A NAME="e66857f2"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cold resistance (5): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The priest enjoys an unusual resistance to natural and magical cold, gaining a
+2 bonus to saving throws versus these effects. Ice-based attacks or effects
are included in the priest’s resistance.
<P></P>
<A NAME="fd27d49f"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Combat bonus (20): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The priest’s THAC0 advances at the warrior rate of 1 per level instead of the
normal priest rate of 2 per 3 levels. The effects of this ability become more
pronounced at higher levels. 
<P></P>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Communication (10): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A priest with this ability learns one language per level from a related group
of racial tongues. For example, a druid learns the languages of woodland or
sylvan races. A priest of a god of the sea might learn the languages of aquatic
races instead, while a dwarven priest could learn the languages of mountain races
or creatures of stone.
<P></P>
<A NAME="c9ec1c7b"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Detect evil (10): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This power allows the priest to use <I>detect evil </I>once per day per two levels (twice a day at 3rd, three times a day at 5th,
etc.). The priest must stand still and concentrate for one round; in all other
respects the ability operates just like a detect evil spell cast by the priest.
<P></P>
<A NAME="caaa455e"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Detect undead (10): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A priest with this ability may use <I>detect undead </I>once per day per two levels. He need only stand still and concentrate for one
round to invoke the power. The duration and area of effect are the same as a <I>detect undead </I>spell cast by the priest.
<P></P>
<A NAME="4bbf1aad"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Expert healer (10): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A priest with this power gains one additional <I>cure light wounds</I> per day in addition to any he chooses to memorize.
<P></P>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Extended spell duration (10/15): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The duration of any noninstantaneous spell cast by the priest is increased by
one time unit per two levels. The unit of time varies, depending on how the
spell’s duration is normally measured; rounds for rounds, turns for turns, and so
on. For 10 points, this applies to spells of one sphere and for 15 points to
spells of all spheres.
<P></P>
<A NAME="8ff90210"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fire/electrical resistance (7): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The priest gains a +2 bonus to saving throws vs. fire or electrical effects,
including both natural phenomena and magical attacks.
<P></P>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Followers (5/10): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">For 5 points, the priest gains followers as described in the <A HREF="../PHB/DD01480.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01480.html">Player’s Handbook</A> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">for the standard cleric—at 8th level, 20 to 200 soldiers arrive to serve the
character. If the priest spends 10 CPs on this ability, he gains these followers
whenever he establishes a suitable stronghold, regardless of level.
<P></P>
<A NAME="594feaf1"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hit point bonus (10): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A priest with this ability uses a d10 for his Hit Die instead of a d8.
<P></P>
<A NAME="c9b82907"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Identify plants and animals (5/8): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">At 3rd level, the character gains the ability to identify natural plants and
animals. He may also identify pure water. For an additional 3 CPs, the priest
has this ability at 1st level.
<P></P>
<A NAME="4b5a8235"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Immunity to charm (5+): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">At 7th level, the priest becomes immune to <I>charm </I>effects or spells cast by a group of related creatures, such as woodland
creatures, undead, plant monsters, extraplanar monsters, or wizards. The priest may
gain this power at an earlier level for a cost of +1 CP per level (6 CPs at 6th
level, 7 at 5th, and so on.) Each class of monsters or races the priest is
immune to costs an additional 5 CPs each.
<P></P>
<A NAME="cf4252dc"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Immunity to magic (15): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The priest enjoys partial immunity to one type of magic—alterations,
invocations, necromancy, and so on. Both wizard and priest spells of this type are
included. The priest gains a +4 bonus to saving throws against spells of the type
chosen, or a normal, nonpenalized saving throw against spells that do not
normally allow a save.
<P></P>
<A NAME="6e71caef"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Immunity to natural disease (10): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The priest is immune to normal diseases, although magical diseases such as
lycanthropy and mummy rot still affect him. This is similar to the paladin’s
ability to resist disease.
<P></P>
<A NAME="75bdd8f7"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Inspire/enrage allies (5/10): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Through his prayers and exhortations, the priest can inspire his allies in
battle, giving them a +1 bonus to their attack rolls and saving throws. The priest
must do nothing but chant for at least three full rounds before his allies
gain bonuses, and the effects last for 1d3 rounds after he stops. All allies
within 10 feet of the priest are affected. As a 10-point power, his allies become
enraged, increasing the bonuses to +2. The priest can do nothing else while using
this power.
<P></P>
<A NAME="6d34d873"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Know alignment (15): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Once per day per two levels, the priest may make use of <I>know alignment. </I>The spell functions exactly as if it was actually cast by the priest.
<P></P>
<A NAME="10d6e49e"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Lay on hands (10): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The priest has the power to lay on hands once per day, curing up to 2 points
of damage per experience level. This is identical to the paladin character class
ability.
<P></P>
<A NAME="d0830346"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Pass without trace (5/7): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">At 3rd level, the priest gains the ability to pass without trace, as per the
spell, at his normal movement rate. For 7 CPs the character may have this
ability at 1st level.
<P></P>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Proficiency group crossovers (5+): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Normally, priests may learn nonweapon proficiencies from the priest and
general lists at no extra cost. Each additional crossover group costs 5 CPs and
allows the priest to learn nonweapon proficiencies from another character group’s
list with no penalty.
<P></P>
<A NAME="d78a70f8"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Purify water (5): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Once per day, the priest may make use of a <I>purify food and drink </I>spell, applying it to water or brine only. The power operates as a spell cast
by the priest in respect to area of effect.
<P></P>
<A NAME="d30b15a6"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Resist energy drain (5/15): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Priests with this ability gain a +1 to saving throws versus the<I> energy drain </I>spell and the level-draining attacks of the undead. If the attack does not
normally allow a saving throw, the power has no effect, but the saving throw
modifier does apply to characters under a negative plane protection. For 15 points,
this ability allows a priest to attempt a saving throw vs. spell with a –4
penalty to avoid a level-draining attack that normally allows no saving throw.
<P></P>
<A NAME="1f43cb2c"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Secret language (5): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Priests with this ability share a secret form of communication that only they
understand. This permits secure conversations in almost any setting.
<P></P>
<A NAME="db25388b"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Shapechange (15+): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This is the druid’s normal shapechange power. Beginning at 7th level, he may
change into a mammal, reptile, or bird three times per day—each form may be used
once. Each transformation heals 10%–60% of any damage the character has
sustained. The acquisition of this power may be accelerated for 2 CPs per level, so
for 17 CPs the priest may shapechange at 6th level.
<P></P>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Spell-like granted power (special): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Many priests have unusual granted powers that simulate the effects of various
spells. Unlike spells, these granted powers require no material components. A
spell-like granted power may be invoked once per week and has a base cost of 10
CPs, plus the following modifiers:
<P></P>

<P></P>
 1 CP/spell level for priest spells
<P></P>
 2 CPs/spell level for wizard spells
<P></P>
 5 CPs for a once per day use
<P></P>
 1 CP/level for each additional daily use
<P></P>
 10 CPs for a continuous or persistent power
<P></P>

<P></P>
 For example, a priest who wishes to invoke a fireball once per week would pay
10 CPs, plus 6 CPs (3rd-level wizard spell), for a total of 16 CPs. The ability
to use the power once per day would cost an additional 5 CPs, for a total of
21 CPs. Using <I>cure light wounds</I> three times per day would cost 10+1+5+2, for a total of 18 CPs.
<P></P>
 Regardless of the amount of points paid, a priest may not have a spell-like
granted power of 6th or higher level and is limited to no more than one granted
power per two levels—one at 1st level, one at 3rd, one at 5th, and so on. The DM
should carefully review any proposed granted powers. Note that when the priest
invokes a power, factors such as range, damage, duration, and other effects
are determined as if he had actually cast the spell.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Spirit powers (30+): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A priest with this ability commands <A HREF="DD03427.html#f2faaad7"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03427.html#f2faaad7">spirit powers</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> , as described for the shaman earlier in this chapter. For 30 CPs, the shaman
may contact one class of spirit: dead, animal, or nature. For each additional
5 CPs, the shaman may contact one more class, so 40 CPs gives the character
full spirit powers.
<P></P>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Thief ability (10+): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">For 10 CPs, the priest may select one thief ability. Each additional 5 CPs
allows the priest to select an additional ability, up to a maximum of four
abilities. (Backstab and thieves’ cant may be selected as abilities.) The priest’s
percentile score increases as noted on <A HREF="../DMG/DD00257.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../DMG/DD00257.html">Table 19: </A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Thief Average Ability Table of the <I>DMG. </I>Modifiers for race, armor worn, and Dexterity still apply to this score.

 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Turn undead (15): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A priest with this power may turn undead, using <A HREF="../PHB/DD01734.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01734.html">Table 61</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> : Turning Undead in the <I>PHB</I>.

At 1st level,
the character is a specialist; at 5th level, a master; at 9th level, a high
master; and at 13th level, a grand master.
<P></P>
<A NAME="71df5cb5"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Warrior ability bonuses (15/20): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">If the priest has a Constitution score of 17 or 18, he gains the additional +3
or +4 hit point adjustment allowed for warriors instead of the normal +2. For
an additional 5 points, the priest may roll an exceptional Strength score of up
to 18/50 if he has a strength of 18.
<P></P>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon selection (5/10): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">For 5 CPs, the priest is allowed to include one edged weapon in his list of
permissible weapons, or instead he may have access to a list of tribal or special
weapons approved by the DM—for example, the druid or thief selections. For 10
CPs, the priest may wield any weapon he wishes to.
<P></P>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon specialization (25): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This ability allows a priest to specialize in a weapon using the normal
specialization rules. Note that the priest must still spend the required number of
proficiency slots or character points to actually gain proficiency and
specialization in a weapon.
<P></P>
<A NAME="a7d87b48"></A>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wizardly priest (25): </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A priest with this power may treat one school of wizard spells as another
sphere of access. Spells memorized from this school count against the priest’s
memorization limits, just as if they were additional priest spells.
