wizard with expertise in this field is familiar with the works of past wizards. If
there was a source of powerful magic in the campaign’s past—for example,
Netheril or Myth Drannor in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting—the arcanologist
has a good idea of who the great mages were and what they were able to
accomplish. Special magical items, spells, or forms of magic wielded by these ancient
sorcerers are familiar to the arcanologist. With a successful proficiency check,
the arcanologist can identify the general purpose and function of an ancient
magical item; the DM may apply a penalty of –1 to –4 if the item comes from a
region outside the arcanologist’s normal studies, or is especially rare or obscure.
Note that this ability doesn’t help a wizard to identify items manufactured by
the “modern” school or tradition of magic, whatever that may be.
