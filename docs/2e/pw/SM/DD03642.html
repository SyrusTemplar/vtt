   <FONT SIZE="3">Similar in most regards to the 4th-level spell <I>Leomund&#146;s
    secure shelter</I>, this spell offers one significant improvement: 
   The shelter is perfectly camouflaged to blend in with whatever 
   terrain or surroundings are appropriate. It may appear as a 
   house-sized boulder in rocky or mountainous areas, a sand dune, a 
   deadfall, a small grassy knoll, or even a mighty tree. The spell also 
   conceals all telltale signs of habitation, including any smoke, 
   light, or sound coming from within the lodge. Creatures or characters 
   who are exceptionally well-tuned to their surroundings (elves, 
   druids, rangers, and various sylvan monsters) may attempt a saving 
   throw vs. spell to spot the hidden lodge if they pass within 30 feet; 
   all other creatures cannot find the wizard&#146;s refuge without the 
   aid of <I>true seeing </I>or similar magic.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">In all other respects, the <I>hidden lodge </I>resembles
    Leomund&#146;s secure shelter. The interior is level, clean, and 
   dry, and the whole thing is sturdily constructed from timber, stone, 
   or sod. It is secure against winds of up to 100 miles per hour, 
   impervious to normal missiles, and the doors, windows, and chimney 
   have the option to be <I>wizard locked </I>and guarded by an <I>alarm </I>spell.
    Simple furnishings include up to ten bunks, a small writing desk, a 
   trestle table and benches, and an optional <I>unseen servant </I>to 
   wait on the wizard. (If any of the optional secondary spells are 
   added on to this spell, then the casting time goes up to one hour and 
   adds a +3 modifier to the subtlety rating.)</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">The material components are a square chip of stone, 
   crushed lime, a few grains of sand, a sprinkle of water, and a 
   splinter of wood, plus a crushed diamond worth at least 100 gold 
   pieces. If the secondary spells are to be included, their material 
   components are required also.</FONT></P>
