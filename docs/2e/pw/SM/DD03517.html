Recovering Spell Points
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Since spell points in this basic system represent the total memorization
ability of a wizard character, they are recovered or regained just like spell
capability in the standard AD&amp;D magic system. In other words, if a character spends
10 spell points to memorize a 3rd-level spell, those points are “tied up” by
holding the spell ready in the character’s memory and can’t be used to memorize
another spell until expended. Spell points used to memorize free magicks are also
tied up in the same fashion.
<P></P>
 Once a character has cast a spell, the spell points used to hold that magick
in memory are <I>gone</I>. The wizard must get a good night’s sleep and re-study his spell book in
order to regain spell points expended through casting spells.
