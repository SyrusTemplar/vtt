Bards and Custom Designed Characters  </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Bards are versatile adventurers whose primary abilities include a fair
assortment of spell powers. Unlike rangers and paladins, who don’t gain spell
abilities until relatively late in their careers, bards may make use of a limited
selection of spells at the beginning of their careers and cast spells at their
actual experience level, not at a reduced level of effectiveness. In addition, the
rapid level progression of the rogue character group means that low-level bards
increase in magical power almost as quickly as their wizard counterparts,
especially if player characters share spells.
<P></P>
 Bards are described in great detail in the <A HREF="../PHB/DD01508.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01508.html">Player’s Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> . As the jacks-of-all-trades of the AD&amp;D game, bards have the weapon choices
of a fighter, the skills of a thief, and some of the magical power of a wizard.
Bards have a slower spell progression than true wizards, and they are limited
to spells of 6th level or less. In addition, bards never gain spells
automatically and must acquire their spells by luck and circumstance, finding them
wherever they can. Bards are subject to all the normal restrictions concerning wizard
spells, including maintenance of spell books and use of armor while casting
spells.

 The term ‘custom-designed character’ refers to any other dilettante who has
access to spells throughout their adventuring careers. A character of this type
may enjoy the spell progression similar to that of a bard, or he may acquire
spells in some other fashion, but he is not a true wizard or priest. Generally,
custom-designed characters are created using the character class design rules

 Bards and customized characters may not specialize in a school of magic. Bards
do not gain the ability to cast spells until they reach 2nd level, at which
point they begin with a spell book of 1d4 randomly determined spells. Note that
bards are not guaranteed spells of the school of universal magic, as wizards
are—their lack of formal training means that these spells are as unfamiliar to
them as spells of the other schools.
