   <FONT SIZE="3">Related to both the <I>contingency </I>and <I>permanency
    </I>spells, <I>persistence </I>allows a wizard to cast a spell of 
   6th level or lower and then hold it until it is needed. There are two 
   general uses for <I>persistence: </I>to use a personal spell effect 
   as needed up to the maximum duration of the <I>persistence </I>itself,
    or to prepare an instantaneous spell and hold it ready until the 
   caster wishes to use it.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>A. Personal effect. </B>Any spell that augments the 
   wizard&#146;s natural abilities&#151;<I>detect magic, protection from 
   evil, jump, infravision, fly, wraithform</I>, or other 
   caster-affecting spells&#151;can be made <I>persistent </I>by use of 
   this spell. The wizard casts <I>persistence </I>and then immediately 
   follows with the desired spell. Instead of taking effect immediately, 
   the magic of the <I>persistence </I>holds it ready for use by a 
   simple act of will. The wizard can then &#147;turn on&#148; or 
   &#147;turn off&#148; the girded spell as often as he likes over the 
   course of the duration of the <I>persistence</I>. The duration of the 
   girded spell only runs while the spell is active, so a 15th-level 
   wizard who makes a <I>fly </I>spell <I>persistent </I>will be able to 
   use 1d6+15 turns of flight (the normal duration of fly) over the next 
   15 days (the duration of the <I>persistence</I>) as he sees fit.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">This is especially useful because it allows the wizard 
   to cast the girded spell and the <I>persistence</I> and have the 
   girded spell&#146;s effects available while he then memorizes another 
   spell in place of the spell made <I>persistent</I>. It is also useful 
   because the girded spell can be activated instantly by an act of 
   will. The main difference between this spell and <I>contingency </I>lies
    in the fact that a <I>persistent </I>spell may be invoked several 
   times (up to the limit of its normal duration) while a <I>contingency </I>functions
    once only.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>B. Held spell. </B>Spells that have an 
   instantaneous effect, such as most attack spells and some movement 
   spells like <I>teleport </I>or <I>dimension door</I>, can be rendered <I>persistent
    </I>as well. The held spell may be activated or discharged at any 
   time during the duration of the <I>persistence</I>, but its magic is 
   then exhausted as if it had been cast normally. This resembles the 
   effect of a <I>contingency </I>spell, but the effect has no 
   predefined conditions and simply occurs when the caster wills it to.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">Damaging or offensive spells that have a duration (for 
   example, <I>flaming sphere or wall of fire</I>) cannot be rendered <I>persistent</I>.
    A wizard may have no more than one <I>persistence </I>spell active 
   at any given time; if he girds a new spell while an old one is still <I>persistent</I>,
    the old spell is simply replaced by the new one. The material 
   component is a crystal chalice of exquisite workmanship worth at 
   least 2,000 gp. The material component of a held or girded spell is 
   expended when the spell is made <I>persistent</I>.</FONT></P>
