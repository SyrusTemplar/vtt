 By means of this spell, the priest prepares an area as a defensive position. <I>Fortify </I>may be used to prepare an open outdoors area such as a field, road, or
grassland, or a rough or broken outdoors area such as a hillside, forest, or
boulder-fall. Large rooms or chambers such as a cavern or a great hall may be <I>fortified </I>as well. The exact effects of the spell depend on the nature of the site to be <I>fortified</I>.
<P></P>
 <B>A. Open Outdoors Site: </B>A rampart or dike of earth and loose stone rises from the ground along the
perimeter of the site, leaving a shallow ditch on the outward face. Creatures
defending the dike receive 50% cover against missile fire (+4 bonus to AC), or 25%
cover (+2 bonus) if they expose themselves by engaging in melee combat or
firing missiles out of the dike. Attackers cannot charge, run, or sprint over the
ditch-and-dike. Large, open rooms or chambers with few features may fall into
this category.
<P></P>
 <B>B. Rough Outdoors Site: </B>Loose stones and boulders, deadwood, and patches of dense briars are arranged
to form a defensible wall or rampart along the perimeter of the area of effect.
Characters hiding behind the wall receive 75% cover (+7 bonus to AC), or 50%
cover if they expose themselves by firing missiles or defending the wall. In
hand-to-hand combat, the wall’s defenders receive a +1 bonus to attack rolls;
man-sized attackers must spend one full round in climbing over the wall in order to
enter the <I>fortified </I>area. Natural caverns and large, cluttered chambers fall into this category,
as well.
<P></P>
 <B>C. Marshy or Low-lying Site: </B>In areas such as swamp, marsh, bog, or tundra, <I>fortify </I>cannot raise a wall or dike to cover the defenders. Instead, the spell creates
a water-filled ditch around the perimeter of the area of effect. This ditch is
10 feet wide and 2 to 4 feet deep; most creatures require 1 full round to
negotiate the ditch, and defenders gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against enemies
who are wading the ditch or climbing up the other side.
<P></P>
 The fortifications are permanent, although erosion, weathering, and
excavations, clearing, or filling can quickly raze the site, returning it to its original
state. The material component is the shell of a snail dusted with 100 gold
pieces worth of diamond powder. In Battlesystem® rules, <I>fortify </I>provides a defending unit with a +2 bonus to its AR against missile and melee
attacks, but no bonus against missile attacks in marshy or low-lying areas.
