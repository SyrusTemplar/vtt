proficiency prepares himself to resist magical or psionic assaults on his mind. The
character receives a +1 bonus to his saving throws against attacks of this nature,
if the attack normally allows a saving throw. Generally, this includes any
attack form that a character’s magical attack adjustment bonus for his Wisdom score
might affect, including mind-affecting spells, <I>charm </I>or <I>fear </I>powers of monsters, and telepathic sciences or devotions that allow the
subject a saving throw.
