spell research. He is familiar with the use of libraries, laboratories, and other
resources, and also has a good grasp of the fundamental processes of
experimentation and problem-solving. With a successful proficiency check, the character
gains a +5% bonus to his success roll when researching a new spell and only
requires one-half the usual amount of time to perform spell research or determine
the process necessary to manufacture a particular magical item. However, the
amount of money spent on research remains the same because the wizard is still
expending the same amount of books and supplies.
