Multi-Classed Spellcasters  </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Demihuman characters are some of the most popular and flexible characters in
the AD&amp;D game. In addition to their various racial advantages, most demihumans
also have the ability to advance as multi-classed characters, such as an elf
fighter/mage or a dwarf fighter/cleric. Generally, a multi-classed character may
freely use abilities of either class but must also abide by class restrictions
and penalties. For example, a fighter/mage can’t cast spells while wearing
armor, nor could a fighter/thief try to move silently while wearing plate mail.
