 A school of thaumaturgy defines a specific method or procedure of spellcasting
that varies from the standard execution of a spell’s components. Several
schools of thaumaturgy were presented in <I>Player’s Option: <A HREF="../SP/DD03183.html#adcc3671"></A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="../SP/DD03183.html#adcc3671">Skills &amp; Powers</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><I> </I>—the school of song, the school of alchemy, and the school of geometry. In
addition, other schools of thaumaturgy have appeared in specific campaign
settings. The defiler of the Dark Sun campaign is a mage whose spells are executed
through the draining of life energy from his surroundings. The sha’ir of the
Al-Qadim setting casts his spells by sending a servant gen, or minor genie, to fetch
the spell and bring it back to him.

 Spells belonging to a school of thaumaturgy are not linked by philosophy or
effect—instead, they’re related by the manner in which they are physically cast.
In fact, the “standard” approach to wizard magic defined by the eight
philosophical schools represents one common thaumaturgical method. Other thaumaturgical
methods include the following schools:

 <B>The School of Alchemy: </B>In this approach to magic, spell effects are achieved through the combination
of unusual material components. Spells such as affect <I>normal fires, glitterdust, </I>and <I>cloudkill </I>can all be cast through the use of strange powders and reagents, and belong to
the school of alchemy.

 <B>The School of Artifice: </B>This is a new school introduced here for the first time. Artificers are weak
in the direct command of magic and instead use various devices and magical items
to focus their energies. Spells such as <I>Melf’s minute meteors </I>and <I>magic staff </I>are included in the school of artifice.

 <B>The School of Geometry: </B>Geometers use diagrams, symbols, and complex patterns to cast their spells.
Naturally, any spell involving some kind of writing, marking, or pattern belongs
to the school of geometry, including spells such as <I>explosive runes, sepia snake sigil, </I>and <I>symbol</I>.

 <B>The School of Song: </B>While alchemists rely on material components and geometers rely on somatic
components, a song mage uses the power of his voice to summon and shape spell
energy. Any spell that involves speaking, singing, or some other use of the
caster’s vocal powers belongs to the school of song. <I>Sleep, charm monster, </I>and <I>Otto’s irresistible dance </I>are all examples of spells of this school.

<P></P>
 <B>The School of Wild Magic: </B>Some wizards have learned to make use of the principles of randomness in their
magic, giving rise to the school of wild magic. Wild mages shape the raw,
uncontrollable stuff of magic in the hope that something resembling their intended
spell will appear. A number of wild magic spells such as <I>vortex </I>and <I>waveform </I>appeared in the <A HREF="../TM/DD04132.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../TM/DD04132.html">Tome of Magic</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> ; if you do not have access to that book, you should probably ignore this
school.
