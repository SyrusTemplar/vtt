Specialists in Schools of Thaumaturgy
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> While the schools of effect and the schools of philosophy differ in the way in
which spells are assigned to the various schools, the schools of thaumaturgy
represent an entirely different way of thinking. The thaumaturgical schools
discard the normal methods and mechanics of wizard magic to concentrate on new ways
of summoning and controlling magical power. In this scheme of magic, spells
are organized by method of casting, not effect or method of operation.
<P></P>
 Since the schools of thaumaturgy represent a more radical departure from the
normal scheme of magic, the benefits and disadvantages of specialization vary
from school to school. In addition, the thaumaturgical specialists generally have
high ability score requirements, as shown in <A HREF="DD03408.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03408.html">Table 4</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> : Thaumaturgical Specialist Requirements.
