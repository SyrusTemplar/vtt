Naturally, wizards and priests aren’t the only spellcasters in the AD&amp;D game.
Rangers, paladins, and bards are all capable of casting spells. In addition, a
variety of monsters cast spells as well, or make use of spell-like powers.

tool—or weapon—and can provide significant advantages even at low levels. For
example, a bard with <I>spider climb, comprehend languages</I>, and <I>clairaudience </I>will never have to worry about missing a crucial climb walls, detect noise, or
read languages roll.

of course, villains with a similar range of powers are among the most dangerous
enemies a PC party can face.
