Using the Wizard Character Design Rules</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
 In case you aren’t familiar with point-based character design, here’s how it
works: You get to decide which class abilities and which hindrances your
character will have during his adventuring career. For example, if you want your
wizard character to have the hit points and fighting ability of a priest, you can
select the appropriate abilities to do so—but chances are good that your
character will have to make serious sacrifices elsewhere in order to get this advantage.
<P></P>
 When you custom-design a wizard, your character begins with 40 character
points. Each ability you select for your character costs character points, but you
can gain extra points by choosing limitations. Unless you spend points on
special powers or select special limitations, your wizard character uses a four-sided
Hit Die, uses the wizard’s THAC0 and saving throw charts, gains the ability to
cast wizard spells as noted in the <I>PHB </I>on <A HREF="../PHB/DD01471.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01471.html">Table 21</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> : Wizard Spell Progression, may use any magical item normally usable by
wizards, may not wear armor, and is limited to the following weapons: dagger, dart,
knife, sling, or staff. Note that your customized wizard character must spend
points to gain schools from which he can cast spells.
<P></P>
 Under these rules, you are under no obligation to build your character as a
mage or a specialist wizard. Your character’s powers and spell schools will be
determined entirely by your choices here. However, for your convenience you may
want to use these basic wizard classes as starting points.<I> If you decide to begin the customizing process with a mage or specialist
wizard, your character receives no character points to choose new or optional
abilities. </I>Since the mage or any specialist wizard is already a complete character class,
the only way to add new powers is to compensate for them by selecting new
limitations for a net point cost of zero.
<P></P>
 <B>The School of Universal Magic: </B>All wizards have full access to this school at a cost of zero character
points. This school contains spells basic to any wizard’s studies.
