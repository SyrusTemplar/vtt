 A 1st-level wizard begins play with 3d4 1st-level spells in his spell book,
two of which must be<I> read magic </I>and <I>detect magic</I>. Once these two have been included in the spell book, the player may select
any other 1st-level spells of the school of universal magic without making a
learn spells roll. In addition, a specialist wizard may automatically choose one
spell of his specialty to begin play with. Beyond these selections, the player
must attempt a learn spells check for any additional spells he wishes his
character to know, with the normal penalties or bonuses for specialization.
Optionally, the DM may assign a beginning wizard character <I>read magic, detect magic</I>, and four other spells of the DM’s choice.

spells that he may wish to add to his spell book. In addition, mages may add a spell
to their book whenever they reach a new spell level, while specialist wizards
are allowed to add one spell of their specialty to their spell books each time
they gain an experience level. Last but not least, the DM may allow a PC wizard
to purchase spells from an NPC wizard or organization. The price should be a
spell of equal level that the NPC doesn’t know, a magical item other than a
potion or scroll, or at least 1,000 gp per level of the spell in question.
