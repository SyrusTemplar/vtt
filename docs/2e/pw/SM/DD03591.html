Other Collateral Effects
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Magic is astonishing and almost always has effects or uses that are not
immediately apparent. Feel free to improvise when a player in your campaign tries
something that seems especially clever—or stupid. What happens when a purple worm
is <I>polymorphed </I>into a puppy dog just after swallowing a still-living character? Or how do the
various rays of the <I>prismatic spray </I>affect the area around them if they miss their target? What kind of wreckage
does an<I> acid storm </I>spell leave behind when cast in a forest clearing? Be creative and take your
best guess; the AD&amp;D game is made of exceptions and special cases.
