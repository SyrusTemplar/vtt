 As noted before in the chapter on <A HREF="DD03378.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03378.html">wizards</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> , a point-based character design system allows players a chance to create
extremely capable characters, especially if role-playing disadvantages are used to
finance game mechanic bonuses. The DM should carefully review any character
assembled under these rules and make a special note of weaknesses or blind spots.
Even a minor role-playing disadvantage can go a long ways towards discouraging
an unbalanced design if the DM is a little creative.
