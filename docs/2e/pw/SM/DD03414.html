Customized Wizard Characters  </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">While there is a broad selection of specialist wizards to choose from in this
book, some players may want to create more unique characters. <I>Player’s Option: <A HREF="../SP/DD02863.html"></A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="../SP/DD02863.html">Skills &amp; Powers</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><I> </I>introduced the concept of point-based character design; this section now
expands that material for wizards. Dozens of new powers, abilities, and restrictions
are described here, allowing the creation of almost any kind of magic-using
character imaginable.
<P></P>
 If you want to use the material here in conjunction with <A HREF="../SP/DD02929.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../SP/DD02929.html">Skills &amp; Powers</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> , this section takes the place of the character class design rules. In
addition to the initial allotment of 40 character points assigned to a character in
this chapter, a player may also choose to spend points left over from the <A HREF="../SP/DD02886.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../SP/DD02886.html">race design</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> chapter and save points in this step for proficiency selections. Note that
there is no restriction on how a character spends his points in this system.

 As always, the DM has the final word on whether or not a particular character
is appropriate for his campaign. If the DM doesn’t like the way a character is
put together, he can have the player try again.
