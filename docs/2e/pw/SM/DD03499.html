Arcanists and Apothecaries  </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Most large towns in a typical AD&amp;D campaign support one or two apothecaries,
herbalists, alchemists, wise women, occultists, or hedge wizards. These
shopkeepers make their living by providing minor enchantments, charms, or herbal
mixtures to the townspeople. For the most part, the services and goods offered by
these merchants are of little interest to the typical adventurer, but they can be
excellent sources of spell components, and from time to time they may purchase
magical items from player characters or have an odd item for sale.
<P></P>
 In addition to the sellers of mundane herbs, minerals, and charms, a few large
cities <I>may </I>support an arcanist’s shop. An arcanist is a merchant who trades in items of
interest to wizards, including spell components, books and parchment suitable
for spell books, and magical items. Arcanists are sometimes sponsored by a large
wizard’s guild and are most frequently found in cities where wizards are
well-regarded and fairly common.
