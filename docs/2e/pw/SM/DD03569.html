Recharging Magical Items</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
 Items that possess charges, such as most wands or rods, can be recharged. Some
item descriptions name the particular class and level of character that can
recharge the item; for example, a <I>rod of security </I>can only be recharged by the combined efforts of a wizard and priest of 18th
level or higher. If the item description does not specify the level required to
recharge it, then it can be recharged by any character who can create an item
(i.e., an 11th-level priest, or a wizard with the ability to cast <I>enchant an item</I>), as long as the character can also cast the highest-level spell simulated or
cast by the item. For example, the highest-level spell incorporated in a <I>wand of fire</I> is <I>wall of fire</I>, a 4th-level wizard spell, which can be cast by a wizard of 7th level or
higher; therefore, if the wizard knows <I>wall of fire</I>, it’s the requirement to <I>enchant an item </I>that is the pressing issue in this case.
<P></P>
 If the character can use the appropriate spells, an item can be recharged by
simply casting <I>enchant an item </I>and then making a saving throw vs. spell to see if the spell takes. (Priests
spend a week praying at their consecrated altar to recharge their items.) If the <I>enchant an item</I> succeeds, the character may then cast the appropriate spells into the item,
taking 1d4 hours per spell. If the preparatory spell fails, then the caster must
make another saving throw vs. spell with a –1 penalty this time; failing this
save results in the item’s ruin. It will never be usable again.
<P></P>
 Assuming the character doesn’t spoil the item by attempting to recharge it, he
may then begin to place spells of the appropriate type into the item. As long
as he begins the next spell within 24 hours of finishing the last one, he can
pour charges into the item without stopping to use <I>enchant an item </I>again. Success is automatic, and the character can place as many (or as few)
additional charges into the item as he likes. However, he may never overcharge
the item by placing more charges into it than it could have at its maximum. For
example, a <I>ring of the ram </I>can hold as many as 10 charges at one time, so it can’t be recharged past that
limit.
