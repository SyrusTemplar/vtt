Priests and Systems of Magic  </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">As you may have noticed, there are a few differences in the way priests and
wizards acquire and memorize spells. The spell point systems described for each
class already reflect these differences to a degree; for example, some of the
wizard’s optional rules aren’t appropriate for priestly spellcasters, and
vice-versa, while the amount of spell points available to each class of spellcaster
varies in order to portray the “normal” spell progression.

 A very good way to highlight the differences between priests and wizards is to
assign schools or systems of magic to each. For example, if you liked the
wizard system of defiling and preserving, you may want to rule that priests cast
spells by means of the channelling rules. In the campaign, wizards will have to
be aware of the life energy around them as they cast their spells, while priests
will instead be concerned with their own capacity to deal with the destructive
power of divine energy. This provides each class with its own distinct flavor
and feel—even though both priests and wizards will be keeping track of spell
points.
