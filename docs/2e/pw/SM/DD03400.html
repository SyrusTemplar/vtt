Specialists in Schools of Effect
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The schools of effect are organized along different lines than the schools of
philosophy. This alternate approach to magic and specialization means that
elementalists and other effect specialists don’t necessarily enjoy the same
benefits and penalties of philosophical specialists. These exceptions are explained
below in the descriptions of the individual specialist wizards.
<P></P>
 Just like the schools of philosophy, specialization in a school of effect
generally requires a wizard to meet higher ability score criteria than that
required of a basic mage (see <A HREF="DD03399.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03399.html">Table 2</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> : Effect Specialist Requirements).
