<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sage Knowledge: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This proficiency represents a specialized area of knowledge or learning. A
character with this skill is a fully qualified sage in the area of study chosen
and is capable of answering questions concerning the topic after some time spent
researching. Refer to <A HREF="../DMG/DD00577.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../DMG/DD00577.html">Table 62</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> : Sage Modifiers and <A HREF="../DMG/DD00578.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../DMG/DD00578.html">Table 63</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> : Research Times in the <I>DMG</I>. As noted in the <A HREF="../DMG/DD00575.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../DMG/DD00575.html">DMG</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> , a sage requires an excellent library as a resource—at least 50 to 100
books, costing no less than 10,000 gp altogether. Naturally, a character may be able
to strike a deal with a university, monastery, or wizards’ guild hall in order
to gain access to their library.
<P></P>
 In addition to his ability to perform sage research, the character’s high
level of learning allows him to make field observations or attempt to come up with
knowledge off the top of his head. For example, a sage who studies botany may
attempt a proficiency check in order to identify a particular plant, while one
who studies toxicology may be able to identify a poison by its symptoms in a
victim. These on-the-spot observations should be limited to information any expert
could reasonably come up with in the field— identifying a common gemstone is
one thing for a geologist, but making a guess about the electrical conductivity
of quartz crystal or the enchantments of a magical gem is a different matter
entirely.
<P></P>
 Purchasing this proficiency at its base cost (2 slots or 5 character points)
gives the sage a broad overview of the area of study in question, allowing him
to answer general or specific questions in the field. For an additional
proficiency slot (or 2 CPs), the character may become an expert in one particular
aspect of the topic. For example, a botanist may spend another slot to specialize in
moss and lichens, ferns, or all plants found in a particular climate or
ecosystem. This detailed knowledge allows the character to attempt to answer exacting
questions in the field. The fields of study available to a sage include:
<P></P>
<A NAME="44b82058"></A><A NAME="44b82058"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Alchemy: </B>This is the study of magical chemistry, especially as it applies to elemental
transmutations and potions, oils, and magical compounds or solvents. Unlike the
proficiency of alchemy, the sage knowledge of alchemy concentrates on theories
and principals, not on the practical day-to-day manufacture of specific
compounds and substances. An alchemist specialist wizard or a character with the
alchemy proficiency gains a +2 bonus to his proficiency rating in this area of sage
knowledge.
<P></P>
<A NAME="b9769342"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Architecture: </B>This is the study of the development, theories and styles of architecture.
(The architecture proficiency, on the other hand, represents the practical
execution of workable building plans.) A sage with this field of study can attempt to
identify the age, origins, and general purpose of ruined buildings or
structures.
<P></P>
<A NAME="9c0fa37a"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Art: </B>The sage is familiar with the great works of the past as well as the works of
the best contemporary artists. If he specializes in one particular art form
(sculpture, paintings, ornamental pottery, etc.) he is able to identify works of
the masters, spot fakes, and appraise pieces for sale value.
<P></P>
<A NAME="d2813a6d"></A><A NAME="d2813a6d"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Astrology: </B>This is the history and theoretical background of astrology, not the actual
art of prediction. Someone with the astrology proficiency knows that Planet X
passing in front of Constellation Y means trouble, but a sage knows why that’s a
sign of ill fortune. In addition, the sage has the ability to perform historical
astrology by working backwards to determine the stars’ and planet’s alignments
for thousands of years in the past. An expert in this field may be familiar
with the constellations and beliefs of vanished or dead cultures.
<P></P>
<A NAME="c54aeb65"></A><A NAME="c54aeb65"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Astronomy: </B>For the astrologer, planets and constellations are representations of greater
powers. The astronomer, on the other hand, assigns no characteristics or
indications to these heavenly bodies, and instead concentrates on studying their
movements in the skies. He can predict eclipses, anticipate the return of comets or
meteor showers, and answer questions about the locations or predicted
locations of various planets or other bodies in the skies.
<P></P>
<A NAME="311bd5e8"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Botany: </B>This is the study of plants, ranging from simple cataloguing and observation
to detailed studies of life-cycles and ecologies. Areas of specialization
include simple plants, water plants, grasses and brush, flowering plants,
domesticated plants, plant diseases, and ecological systems such as rain forest, tundra,
prairie, etc.
<P></P>
<A NAME="62bb5a7b"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Cartography: </B>Cartography is the art of map-making. A sage who specializes in this field
knows where to find maps for any given region or area, knows how to interpret maps
using various forms of notation, and can attempt to solve or complete
encrypted or partial maps.
<P></P>
<A NAME="99f34445"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Chemistry: </B>While alchemy focuses on the study of magical substances, chemistry
concentrates on the study of the properties of mundane substances. Note that a character
with the alchemy proficiency is assumed to use a fair amount of mundane
chemistry to produce acids, solvents, and pyrotechnic substances.
<P></P>
<A NAME="ca5ffc6d"></A><A NAME="ca5ffc6d"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Cryptography: </B>This is the study of codes, ciphers, and puzzles. A sage with skill in
cryptography can attempt to break codes or solve written puzzles with time and study.
<P></P>
<A NAME="884e0b22"></A><A NAME="884e0b22"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Engineering: </B>The character is familiar with the science of building devices, engines, and
structures. Sage knowledge of engineering provides a +2 bonus to the character’s
nonweapon proficiency score in engineering, if he has both proficiencies. The
character can specialize in small machines, large machines (water wheels,
etc.), siege engineering, fortifications, bridges and roads, or buildings.
<P></P>
<A NAME="aecb2f9b"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Folklore: </B>The sage studies legends and folk tales. By spending another proficiency slot,
he can specialize in the folklore of a particular culture or region.
<P></P>
<A NAME="818ef4a8"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Genealogy: </B>This is the study of lines of descent. A sage with this skill knows research
techniques and sources for tracing family trees and is also familiar with the
histories of the important royal and noble families.
<P></P>
<A NAME="f225f971"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Geography: </B>A sage with this knowledge has learned about the lands and cultures of his
world. He knows general principles of cartography, topography, climatology, and
sociology, and can identify individuals or artifacts from other lands.
<P></P>
<A NAME="1d8003e3"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Geology: </B>Geology is the study of landforms, rock, and the physical makeup of the earth.
A sage with knowledge in this area can add a +2 bonus to his rating in the
mining nonweapon proficiency and can attempt a proficiency check to identify
various sorts of gemstones or precious minerals.
<P></P>
<A NAME="b7d4f63a"></A><A NAME="b7d4f63a"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Heraldry: </B>Coats of arms, banners, flags, and standards are all emblazoned with heraldic
designs. A sage with this skill is familiar with the evolution of heraldry and
the significance of various symbols and colors. He can identify common coats of
arms on sight and knows where to research obscure or unknown devices. This
area of knowledge adds a +2 bonus to a character’s heraldry nonweapon proficiency
score.
<P></P>
<A NAME="7ed02721"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>History: </B>A sage with this skill has an excellent grasp of history and the historical
methods. Unlike a character with the ancient or local history proficiencies, a
sage with this skill is a generalist, but he can be considered an expert on a
particular era or culture by spending an additional slot to specialize. Whether or
not the historian knows something off the top of his head doesn’t matter—he
knows exactly where to look when he needs to find out the details of a person’s
life or an important event. Skill in this field of knowledge provides a +2 bonus
to the character’s proficiency score in ancient history or local history.
<P></P>
<A NAME="b5f8f712"></A><A NAME="b5f8f712"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Languages: </B>A character with a modern language proficiency knows how to speak a second
language, and a character with an ancient languages proficiency knows how to read
a second language, but a sage who specializes in languages is concerned with
the study of the language itself—grammar, syntax and constructs, and vocabulary
and word origin. His expertise is limited to one particular tongue, but for each
additional slot the linguist may add another language to his field of
expertise. This knowledge adds a +2 bonus to the linguist’s rating in any modern or
ancient language proficiencies he possesses.
<P></P>
<A NAME="f8ff527b"></A><A NAME="f8ff527b"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Law: </B>A sage with this field of study is an expert on matters of law. He is familiar
with any national constitutions or charters, the origin and history of the
law, and important matters of precedent. He can examine contracts, warrants,
orders, or decrees and determine if there is a way to enforce or avoid them.
<P></P>
<A NAME="c64e7d8f"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Mathematics: </B>The study of abstract or theoretical mathematics may seem unusual in a fantasy
setting, but it dates back thousands of years in our own world; the ancient
Greeks laid the groundwork for geometry, while algebra was a pastime of Islamic
scholars and nobles before the European Renaissance. A dimensionalist gains a +2
bonus on his proficiency rating in this area of study.
<P></P>
<A NAME="6e4f8fb7"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Medicine: </B>A sage with this skill studies both the history and development of medicine,
as well as current methods and treatments. This provides the character with a +2
bonus to his healing nonweapon proficiency score. In addition, the character
may be able to come up with treatments for nonmagical diseases or injuries.
<P></P>
<A NAME="7c0ce515"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Meteorology: </B>This is the study of weather and weather patterns. A sage with this skill
knows historical records and prediction methods. In the field, his knowledge of
weather provides a +2 bonus to any weather sense proficiency checks he makes.
<P></P>
<A NAME="04ba0548"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Music: </B>The sage knows the theory and notation systems of music and has studied the
works of the great masters. He can attempt to identify unknown pieces or decipher
musical puzzles.
<P></P>
<A NAME="79bf4d97"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Myconology: </B>Myconology is the study of fungi. A myconologist can identify samples of
fungus, mold, or spores. He is familiar with dangerous or monstrous varieties as
well and may be able to spot these in the wild before he or his companions come to
harm. His knowledge of mushrooms and molds gives him a +2 bonus to herbalism
nonweapon proficiency checks.
<P></P>
<A NAME="71cbef9d"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Oceanography: </B>A sage with this skill studies the ocean, including weather, marine biology,
navigation and charting, and undersea topography. An oceanographer may be able
to explain unusual phenomena at sea or discover the location of wrecks or other
sites of interest.
<P></P>
<A NAME="1a4a6130"></A><A NAME="1a4a6130"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Philosophy: </B>The study of philosophy is the study of logic, ethics, aesthetics, and
metaphysics (for game purposes, anyway), and a sage with expertise in this field is
conversant with the great thinkers and arguments of his race or culture.
<P></P>
<A NAME="da10de4e"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Physics: </B>In most AD&amp;D campaigns, the study of physics centers around mechanics and
thermodynamics; some of the more advanced fields of study simply haven’t been
invented yet.
<P></P>
<A NAME="b38e2af9"></A><A NAME="b38e2af9"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Planes, Inner: </B>Most individuals in a campaign have little to no knowledge of worlds beyond
the one in which they live, but a sage with expertise in this field is familiar
with the characteristics and properties of the Ethereal Plane and the various
Elemental Planes beyond that. He understands how the Inner Planes are aligned and
how the multiverse is put together. If he spends an additional slot to
specialize, he can be an expert on a particular plane, capable of answering exacting
questions on the topic.
<P></P>
<A NAME="ef84b60c"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Planes, Outer: </B>The great religions of a campaign tend to disseminate a very limited view of
the multiverse, centering on the home of their deity and that of their deity’s
principal foes. A sage who studies this field has a general understanding with
the general arrangement of all the Outer Planes and the characteristics of the
Astral Plane. For an additional slot, he can specialize in a particular plane,
learning the general properties of its layers, its chief inhabitants and
domains, and other important details.
<P></P>
<A NAME="507fea41"></A><A NAME="507fea41"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>School of Magic: </B>A sage with expertise in a school of magic is familiar with the important
theories, works, and great mages of that field. By engaging in research and passing
a proficiency check, the sage could identify spells or magical items belonging
to the school by the item’s general effects or appearance. For example, if he
was a student of the school of force, he could identify a <I>wand of force </I>or <I>beads of force </I>as if he were trying to answer a specific question. If the sage is also a
wizard, he gains a +5% bonus to his chance to learn spells from the school in
question. A specialist wizard gains a +2 to his score in this proficiency if the
school of magic is his own specialty.
<P></P>
<A NAME="df522a3b"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Sociology: </B>This is the study of social structures, customs, mores, and ways of life. The
sage is also acquainted with past societies and their customs.
<P></P>
<A NAME="384eabb2"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Theology: </B>A sage with expertise in this area is conversant with the tenets and beliefs
of most major religions, gaining a +2 bonus to his religion nonweapon
proficiency check. In addition, he studies the theories and lore surrounding the powers
and boundaries of the gods themselves. With research, a theologist can determine
what a particular god might or might not be capable of doing.
<P></P>
<A NAME="8bab70b0"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Toxicology: </B>This is the study of poisons, both natural and artificial. A sage with
expertise in toxicology can identify poisons both from samples and from examining the
symptoms of a poisoned victim. By using toxicology, a sage can also gain a +1
to any healing proficiency check dealing with poisons.
<P></P>
<A NAME="17adf73e"></A>
<P></P>
 <B>Zoology: </B>Zoology is the study of animals. A sage who acquires knowledge in this area
has a good overall grasp of the science of zoology, and in addition, he is
considered a specialist in one general class of animals or monsters. Each additional
slot he spends on this proficiency adds one more type or class to his
expertise. Classes of animals available include birds, reptiles, mammals, fish,
amphibians, insects, amorphous monsters (slimes, jellies, and molds), aquatic monsters,
insectile monsters, reptilian monsters, mammalian monsters, hybrid monsters
(griffins, perytons, etc.), and any other reasonable class or grouping the DM
allows.
<P></P>
 A zoologist can identify common species in the field with a successful
proficiency check and may be able to predict behavior or capabilities based on his
knowledge of the creature in question.
