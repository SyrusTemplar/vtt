Laboratories  </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">At some point in his or her career, just about every wizard is going to need a
well-equipped laboratory. Without a laboratory, a wizard can’t perform spell
research or create any kind of magical item except a scroll. A laboratory
consists of several different components, including a physical site or facility; a
personal library; nonexpendable equipment and furniture; and expendable supplies,
chemicals, and reagents.
