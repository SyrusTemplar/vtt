   <FONT SIZE="3">This spell conjures into existence seven magical orbs 
   that float above the caster&#146;s head in a ring about 5 feet in 
   diameter. The eyes remain for 1 round per level, or until the caster 
   chooses to either expend the orb by using it in attack or defense. In 
   addition, as long as at least one eye is still in existence, the 
   caster gains 360&#176; vision and can <I>detect invisibility </I>and <I>detect
    phase </I>at will, with a 60-foot range. The powers of each eye are 
   described below.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Eye of the Mind. </B>This orb protects the caster 
   against mental attack, charm, or influence, including <I>charm, 
   beguiling, hold</I>, and <I>emotion </I>effects. The first such 
   attack is negated by the orb and destroys it in turn. If the wizard 
   desires, the eye of the mind can instead be used to <I>charm person </I>like
    the 1st-level wizard spell, although this also expends the orb.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Eye of the Sword.</B> This eye deflects the first 
   physical attack that endangers the caster, including hand-held or 
   missile attacks, and then disappears. The wizard can also employ the 
   eye of the sword to create five magical blades that strike as <I>magic
    missiles </I>for 1d4+1 points of damage each. (Knockdown d6, medium 
   (1 hit) impact)</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Eye of the Mage. </B>One manifestation of raw 
   energy, such as lightning, fire, force, cold, or a similar effect, is 
   absorbed by the eye of the mage. The eye can also project a 60-foot 
   long by 5-foot wide <I>lightning bolt </I>that inflicts 4d8 damage 
   (saving throw vs. spell for half damage) to all in its path. Either 
   use expends the eye&#146;s power. (Knockdown d12, large (1&#150;3 
   hits) electricity)</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Eye of Venom. </B>This eye can be used to halt any 
   one attack or effect that could poison the caster. In the case of an 
   attacker armed with an envenomed weapon, the caster may decide to 
   expend either the eye of venom or the eye of swords in order to block 
   the attack. The eye can also be used to poison one creature within 30 
   feet; the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or die in one round.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Eye of the Spirit.</B> The first attack that 
   affects the victim&#146;s life energy, including <I>energy drain, 
   strength drain, cause wounds, trap the soul, magic jar</I>, or <I>death
    </I>is parried by the eye of the spirit. The wizard may instead 
   choose to expend the eye&#146;s power by casting </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01940.html">enervation</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><I> </I>(see
    the 4th-level wizard spell) upon one target within 30 feet.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Eye of Artifice. </B>This eye deflects and is 
   destroyed by the first attack directed at the caster from a magical 
   device. If the attack also takes a form that may be blocked by 
   another eye (for example, the bolt from a <I>wand of lightning</I>) 
   the caster may choose which eye is expended. If used to attack 
   instead, the eye of artifice functions as a <I>dispel magic </I>cast 
   at 8th level.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Eye of Stone. </B>This eye offers protection 
   against the first attack that could petrify the caster and then 
   vanishes. It can also be expended to cast <I>hold person</I>.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">Although any number of eyes can defend the wizard in 
   the course of a single round, only one eye may be used to attack per 
   round. When the caster uses an eye to attack, he may not cast a 
   spell, attack physically, or employ another magical item in the same 
   round; willing the eye to discharge its energies requires his 
   complete concentration. Eye attacks are considered to have an 
   initiative modifier of 1 or a speed of very fast in the <I>Player&#146;s

   worth at least 50 gold pieces each.</FONT></P>
