Customized Priest Characters  </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">At least one of the five priest character classes presented in this book are
appropriate for almost any faith, but some unique priesthoods may require
special treatment. The point-based character design system explained here allows a
player to create almost any kind of priest character imaginable. Generally, this
system works much like the point-based wizard design rules introduced in <A HREF="DD03378.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03378.html">Chapter 1</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> ; it expands the specialty priest design rules from <I>Player’s Option: <A HREF="../SP/DD02955.html#7406776d"></A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="../SP/DD02955.html#7406776d">Skills &amp; Powers</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><I> .</I>

 A priest character receives 120 character points to purchase the spheres of
access, granted abilities, and class abilities the player desires. Each ability
costs a variable number of character points. A character can gain extra CPs with
which to buy abilities by choosing limitations, or reduce the cost of an
ability by deferring it to a higher level. An ability deferred to 3rd level is 1
point cheaper than normal, 2 points cheaper at 5th, 3 points cheaper at 7th, 4
points cheaper at 9th, and 5 points cheaper if deferred until 11th level. All
abilities have a minimum cost of 1 CP.

 The basic priest has a d8 Hit Die, uses the priest’s THAC0 and saving throw
chart, gains the ability to cast priest spells as indicated on <A HREF="../PHB/DD01479.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01479.html">Table 24</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> : Priest Spell Progression in the <I>PHB</I>, may use only bludgeoning weapons, may wear any kind of armor, and may use
any magical item normally usable by priests. The priest does <I>not </I>begin play with any spheres of access; he must purchase each sphere of access
he wishes to have available. For example, if a player wishes his priest to have
major access to the sphere of elemental air, he needs to spend 5 CPs. If, on
the other hand, he wants the priest to have <I>minor </I>access to all of the elemental spheres, he needs to spend 8 CPs.
<P></P>
 For minor alterations to an existing priest class, a customized character can
begin the process with all the abilities and restrictions of the cleric,
crusader, or any other variety of priest. If this is the starting point for the
customized character, the character receives 0 CPs to purchase new abilities; he
must take limitations to compensate for all new abilities he selects.
