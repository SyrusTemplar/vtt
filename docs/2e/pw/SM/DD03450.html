Proficiencies and Character Points  </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Since <I>Player’s Option: Spells &amp; Magic </I>is part of the <I>Player’s Option </I>series, rules and information for proficiencies are described in two formats:
the system of slots and check modifiers described in the <A HREF="../PHB/DD01522.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01522.html">Player’s Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><I> </I>and also in terms of character points for readers who are using the <I>Player’s Option: <A HREF="../SP/DD02863.html#57b7e2df"></A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="../SP/DD02863.html#57b7e2df">Skills &amp; Powers</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><I> </I>rules. Players who wish to create characters using the material in this
chapter should first check with their DM to see which system he wants to use in his
campaign.
<P></P>
 Under either system, characters with high Intelligence scores gain bonus
proficiency slots or character points, based on their maximum number of languages.
Generally, these slots or points can only be spent on nonweapon proficiencies.
If this optional rule is in play, characters <I>must </I>use proficiencies to learn new languages, although all characters can speak
(but not necessarily read or write!) their native tongue without spending a
proficiency slot.
