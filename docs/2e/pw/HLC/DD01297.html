 Throughout the duel, one opponent has the advantage—the upper hand—while the
other caster is disadvantaged. When the duel begins, the advantage lies with the
spellcaster who contributed the highest level spell to the arena (not the
highest combined level of multiple spells). If neither opponent contributed any
spells, or if neither opponent contributed a higher level spell than the other,
each opponent rolls 1d10 and the character with the highest roll has the
advantage. The opponent with the advantage retains it until one of his spells is
destroyed in combat. At that point, the advantage shifts to the other opponent. Each
time a spell destroys another spell in combat, the advantage shifts to the
opponent who cast the victorious spell. The advantage does not shift if a character
defeats a spell through use of his power rating (PR) or making a successful
saving throw.
