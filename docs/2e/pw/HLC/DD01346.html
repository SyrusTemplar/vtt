</B>True Dweomers in Magical Duels</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">  Duelists can attempt to employ true dweomers, but they usually are not
useful because they take too long to prepare and cast. Each round of preparation or
casting time for a true dweomer requires one round in the duel. Both
preparation and spellcasting can be disrupted if the caster fails a saving throw or loses
a character combat roll. Any true dweomer with a casting time of more than one
round is useless as a counter spell.
<P></P>
 In all other respects, true dweomers function like normal spells. All true
dweomers have PRs of 19 and move at a rate based on their ranges. A true dweomer’s
default area of effect and duration is always sufficient to send it moving
across a dueling arena, though in some cases the caster might wish to increase the
difficulty to enhance the spell’s effect once it reaches the opponent’s square
or to give the spell a better movement rate. Use <A HREF="DD01347.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01347.html">Table 35</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> to determine a true dweomer’s spell type in a duel.
