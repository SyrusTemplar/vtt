 Spells such as <I>phantasmal force</I> that allow the caster to create an image of almost anything imaginable are
highly flexible in a duel. The spells can be used to duplicate any type of spell.
The caster chooses the type when casting the spell. Once cast, the spell type
cannot be changed. If employed as an attack, attack/defense, or missile, the
opponent and the caster conduct character combat when the illusion reaches the
opponent’s space, but the defender is allowed to cast counter spells. If the
caster wins the combat, the opponent suffers 1d6 points of damage per level of the
illusion. If the defender wins, no damage is inflicted. When employed as a
leech, the spell follows the normal rules for leech spells. When employed as a
defense, any lock destroys the illusion unless the opposing spell summons a
creature.
