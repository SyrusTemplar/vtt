 Don’t use just one type of encounter, offer a variety of challenges. In this
case, type refers to the main kind of action the encounter offers: combat,
trick/trap, negotiation, and so on. The actual mix of encounter types varies from
campaign to campaign. The bulk of your encounters should be the kind your players
like best, but a mix keeps them on their toes and keeps boredom from setting
in.
