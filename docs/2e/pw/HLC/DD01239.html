<P></P>
 Some monsters, like some people, are just a little bigger, stronger, or
smarter than most. Other creatures might be smaller, weaker, or dumber. You can
create these creatures fairly quickly by applying a modifier to a creature’s basic
statistics, as follows:
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Modifiers:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B> </B>To make a monster weaker, apply a –1, –2, or –3 to its key statistics (see
below). To make a monster stronger, apply a +1, +2, or +3. Once you start altering
a monster, use the same modifier throughout the process.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hit Points:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B> </B>Weaker monsters subtract the modifier from each hit die, but the creature
always receives at least one hit point from each hit die. Stronger creatures add
the bonus to each hit die.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>THAC0:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B> </B>Weaker creatures add the modifier to their THAC0 numbers—not attack
rolls—while stronger creatures subtract the modifier from their THAC0.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Saving Throws:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B> </B>Weaker creatures add the modifier to their base saving throws, but no saving
throw can be increased above 20. Stronger creatures subtract the modifier from
their saving throw numbers, but no saving throw can be reduced below 3.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Damage Dice:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B> </B>Weaker monsters subtract the modifier from each damage die, but the creature
inflicts at least one point of damage with each die. Stronger creatures add the
bonus to each damage die.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Armor Class:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B> </B>Weaker creatures add the modifier to their Armor Class values. Stronger
creatures subtract the modifier from their Armor Class values.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>XP Value:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B> </B>Weaker creatures subtract the modifier from their adjusted hit dice (see <A HREF="../DMG/DD00375.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../DMG/DD00375.html">Dungeon Master Guide</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, Chapter 8). No creature can have a value lower than 1–1. Stronger creatures
add the modifier to their adjusted hit dice.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Other Characteristics:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B> </B>A creature’s movement rate, Intelligence, alignment, morale, and other
statistics remain unchanged under this system, A modifier of +3 can increase the
creature’s size to the next higher class. For example, a large creature might become
a huge creature, but that’s optional. Likewise, a modifier of –3 can reduce a
creature’s size class one step.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>An Example
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> A group of scrags (freshwater trolls) have taken up residence in a river near
an important ford. The bulk of the colony has normal statistics, but the DM
decides that the chief/shaman and her two mates have extraordinary statistics and
also decides to throw in an immature scrag. The chief is very powerful (+3),
her two mates a little less so (+2), and the youth is just a baby (–3).
<P></P>
 The modified statistics (with the original in parentheses) look like this:
<P></P>

<P></P>
<B>Scrag Chief:</B> AC 0 (3); MV 3, Sw 12; HD 5+20 (5+5, +3 per hit die); hp 51; THAC0 12 (15);
#AT 3; Dmg* 1d4+4/1d4+4/3d4+9 (+3 per die); SZ L (the DM decides that she is
about 12 feet tall); ML Elite (14); Int Low (7); AL CE; XP 2,000 (base 650).
<P></P>
<B>Chief’s Mates:</B> AC 1; MV 3, Sw 12; HD 5+15; hp 35 each; THAC0 13; #AT 3; Dmg* 1d4+3/1d4+3/
3d4+6; SZ L; ML Elite (14); Int Low (7); AL CE; XP 1,400 each.
<P></P>
<B>Baby:</B> AC 6; MV 3, Sw 12; HD 5–10 ; hp 13; THAC0 18; #AT 3; Dmg* 1d4–2/1d4–2/3; SZ M
(the DM decides the baby is about 4 feet tall); ML Elite (14); Int Low (7); AL
CE; XP 175.
<P></P>
 
<P></P>
* The scrag racial modifier to claw damage is added after the adjustments to
the dice. In the case of the baby, the +1 bonus offsets part of the –3 penalty
to the creature’s claw attacks, but the –3 modifier to each die of bite damage
reduces each die to its minimum value of 1.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 Even with their enhanced statistics, the chief and her mates wouldn’t last
long in a direct fight with high-level characters, but it helps to explain why
characters of lesser stature haven’t dealt with the scrag colony. Furthermore, the
DM plans to make use of the scrags’ superior mobility in the water when the
PCs encounter them, and the extra damage the trio of more powerful scrags can
inflict should prove to be an unpleasant surprise.
