 High-level PCs have progressed beyond the find-the-monster-take-the-treasure
mode, and the DM must find herculean tasks for them. For example, a group of PCs
might find themselves charged with rescuing a prince or princess early in
their careers. At higher levels, the PCs might find that the fate of an entire
kingdom rests in their hands—that kingdom may very well be their own. Later, the
PCs might find themselves saving the entire world, and in the meantime they
probably function as agents of the gods themselves.
