 Although the arena looks like a sphere from the outside, it has a weird
geometry all its own. It is best pictured as a rectangle 12 to 30 spaces long and one
space wide, resembling a long, narrow corridor more than anything else. The
opponents stand on opposite ends of the corridor facing each other.
<P></P>
 The number of spaces between them depends on the highest level of spell each
opponent contributed to the arena. If neither opponent contributed a spell,
there are 10 intervening spaces. The highest level spell contributed by each
opponent adds its level. For example, if one opponent contributed a 5th-level spell
and the other contributed a 3rd-level spell, there would be 18 spaces between
the duelists. There are never more than 30 spaces between the opponents, and only
the single, highest-level spell contributed by each side of the duel is
factored for determining the distance between the spellcasters. 
<P></P>
 The space occupied by the duelists in the arena does not count as far as the
length of the corridor is concerned. Thus, the largest arena would consist of 32
spaces, but each combatant would occupy one space at opposite ends of the
corridor, leaving 30 spaces between them.
