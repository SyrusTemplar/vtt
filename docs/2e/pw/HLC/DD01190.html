 Don’t encourage combat, encourage creativity. Fighting isn’t the best solution
to every problem, even for characters as wise as Merlin and as strong as
Hercules. Also, as <A HREF="DD01153.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01153.html">Chapter One</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> points out, most combat rolls are moot for high-level characters, so fights
can be pretty unsatisfying.
<P></P>
 Give the player characters some problems they just can’t solve through combat.
A raging forest fire, for example, won’t succumb to sword strokes and <I>death spells</I>, nor is it intimidated by a powerful hero in its path.

 Even combat encounters can require a little brain power on the player
characters’ part. For example, an insane fire elemental might have started the forest
fire in the previous example, but the PCs might be unable to locate or attack it
until after they quench the blaze.
