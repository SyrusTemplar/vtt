 Other mortals pay attention to what heroes say and do. Weaker characters seek
out their advice, but usually try to stay out of their way. Some low-level
characters might idolize them or seek to emulate them. More powerful characters
watch what the PCs do to anticipate perils and opportunities; some of these
characters might become jealous and resentful of a PC’s successes. Deities also begin
watching the heroes; they seek to help and encourage characters who promote
their interests and to hinder characters who might oppose them.
