</B>Skills For High-Level Rogues
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
 The following skills are available to thieves and bards who meet the listed
requirements.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Adaptation: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A character with this skill has a trained mind that quickly analyzes unusual
or unfavorable environments and a finely tuned body that can compensate for
physical impediments to fighting. Except where noted below, it is identical to the
warrior skill of the same name.
<P></P>
 Rogues who use this skill successfully do not suffer combat and initiative
penalties for fighting in an unfavorable environment, most notably the +6 foreign
environment penalty to initiative (see Chapter 9 of the <A HREF="../PHB/DD01689.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01689.html">Player’s Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">). If the environment also includes special saving throws or ability checks
due to physical conditions, such as a Dexterity/Balance check to avoid falling
off a ladder when struck in melee, characters successfully using this skill
receive a +3 (or +15%) bonus to the check.
<P></P>
 The skill does not allow characters to ignore situational movement penalties,
environmental factors that are not combat related, or conditions that are
physically impossible to overcome. For example, no one can avoid sinking into
quicksand without magical aid, and resistance from water still makes slashing and
bludgeoning weapons almost useless without a <I>ring of free action </I>or a <I>free action </I>spell. Likewise, characters adapted to fighting underwater still have to find
ways to breathe.
<P></P>
 The skill has no effect on penalties derived from an environment’s magical
properties or on penalties based on vision or lighting. In fact, characters who
cannot observe their surroundings suffer a –4 penalty to the skill check—it is
very hard to size up battlefield in thick fog or pitch darkness.
<P></P>
 To use this skill, a character must actually enter combat in a foreign or
unfavorable environment. At the end of each round, the character checks the skill.
The skill check requires only a moment’s thought and can be checked every round
until successful. It does not prevent other actions—melee attacks,
spellcasting, etc.—during the round. Once the skill succeeds, the character temporarily
ignores the environment’s special effects, as described above. The effect lasts
for the entire battle plus one day per character level thereafter, and this can
be extended indefinitely if the character practices fighting in the environment
for at least eight hours a week. At an extra cost of one weapon or nonweapon
proficiency slot (or three character points), the character can become
permanently adjusted to fighting in the environment, provided the additional cost is
paid before the adaptation fades.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Classify Traps:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B> </B>Rogues with this skill have made an exhaustive study of traps and may be able
to apply their knowledge to any traps they find. The skill is useless without
the find traps ability.
<P></P>
 A successful skill roll reveals a trap’s exact nature, not just its general
principle. A successful skill roll shows how the trap works and what it does to
people who trigger it. The rogue learns where any attacks the trap launches are
aimed—provided he can observe those areas. The examination requires at least a
turn for basic constructs and possibly much longer for very elaborate traps
(DM’s discretion). A magical or invisible trap reduces the rogue’s success number,
including ability score bonuses, by half, round fractions up.
<P></P>
 A failed skill roll of less than 20 means that the rogue cannot determine
anything special about this particular trap. A roll of 20 means the rogue has made
a false assumption about what the trap does. As with any roll a rogue makes
when finding or removing a trap, the DM should make the skill roll secretly.
<P></P>
 If the rogue decides to disarm a trap after a successful examination, the
character can make two remove traps rolls taking only the best result.
Alternatively, the rogue can simply bypass the trap by standing in a safe place and
triggering it, carefully avoiding the areas it targets. If the DM decides it is not
possible to completely avoid the trap’s effects, the rogue is allowed a saving
throw vs. breath weapon. If successful, the rogue is unharmed; otherwise, the
damage inflicted is reduced by half. If the rogue also has the evasion skill, the
character gets a +2 bonus to the saving throw. If the rogue has companions, the
character can mark or carefully explain what the trap does, allowing these
characters to attempt breath weapon saving throws to avoid the effects. If the
save fails, the victim suffers only half damage.
<P></P>
 In many cases, a trap’s attack cannot have a half effect. In these cases, the
DM can require another saving throw against the trap’s attack form or rule that
character’s are fully effected when they fail the breath weapon saving throw.
<P></P>
 An example: Jobare analyzes a trap he has found on a door and discovers that
opening the door is going to flood the corridor, and possibly chamber beyond,
with poisonous gas. Jobare decides that plugging all the gas vents would require
too much time, so he advises his colleagues to take deep breaths and tie damp
cloths over their faces. When the preparations are complete, Jobare flings open
the door. Because the party did not leave the area the gas is flooding into,
the DM calls for saving throw checks to see if anyone is effected by the gas.
Because it is difficult for someone to suffer a half effect from poison gas, the
DM requires the characters who fail their breath weapon saving throws to roll a
second saving throw vs. poison to see if they succumb to the gas they
inadvertently inhaled. If the trap dropped a 20-ton block into the corridor instead of
poison gas, the DM would have been justified in ruling that character who failed
their breath weapon saving throws were crushed to death instead.

weapons, <I>fireball </I>spells, and the like through a combination of superior reflexes and inner
strength.
<P></P>
 This skill operates automatically whenever a rogue is subjected to an energy
attack that causes damage. The rogue rolls a normal saving throw vs. the effect
and suffers no damage if it is successful. This skill is not effective against
effects that do not inflict damage or that do not normally allow a saving
throw. For example, the skill does not protect the rogue against a bronze dragon’s
repulsion breath weapon, a gorgon’s petrifying breath, or <I>magic missile </I>spells.
<P></P>
 The rogue can also avoid missiles fired from fixed points, such as traps and
siege engines, but not from creatures. If not surprised, the rogue avoids the
missile with a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon.

nearby to help slow the character’s descent. A very accomplished rogue can
fall or jump from amazing heights and not suffer the slightest injury.

 A successful skill check allows the rogue to make contact with a nearby
surface and safely descend. The maximum distance from a vertical surface and the
maximum distance for a safe fall depends of the rogue’s level:

<P></P>
 Rogues who simply step off a precipice or fall while climbing are always
within one foot of a vertical surface unless it has a negative slope (angled back
under the place from which the rogue fell). Any surface that can provide a
reasonable amount of friction when the rogue grabs it or places his hands or feet
against it is sufficient (ropes, tree trunks, walls, etc.). Very smooth or
slippery surfaces are useless (ice walls, greased poles, <I>walls of force</I>, etc.).
<P></P>
 If the fall is longer than the safe distance allowed for the rogue’s level,
subtract the safe distance from the total distance before determining damage from
the fall. For example, a trap door opens under Jobare, a 20th-level thief, and
dumps him into a shaft 10 feet square. No matter what happens, Jobare is
within five feet of one wall, so he can attempt to break his fall. His skill roll
succeeds, however, the shaft goes down 150 feet and then opens into a chamber 30
feet high and several hundred feet across. Jobare can break only the first 120
feet if his fall and suffers 6d6 points of damage for the final 60 feet. Even
if he had been a 30th-level thief, Jobare would have suffered 3d6 points of
damage because there was no surface within reach to break the final 30 feet of the
fall.

 This skill is a function of the rogue’s move silently ability, which is a
requirement for using this skill. A rogue who makes a successful move silently roll
can move a short distance over a surface fairly quickly and without exerting
any appreciable weight on it, according to the table below.

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Improvised Attack: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Rogues with this skill can use unorthodox and unexpected maneuvers to achieve
special results in combat. The more unusual the maneuver, the better its chance
for success.
<P></P>
 A rogue can use this skill only once a day, but the character can learn the
skill multiple times. For example, a rogue who learns this skill three times can
make three improvised attacks each day. An improvised attack can have one of
the following effects:
<P></P>
 <I>Blinding: </I>If the attack succeeds, the opponent must save vs. breath weapon or suffer
blocked vision (from debris thrown into the eyes, an object wrapped around the
victim’s head, or even a hat or helmet dropped over the eyes). The opponent
suffers the full penalties for darkness (–4 to attacks, saving throws, and Armor
Class and movement reduced to one-third; see the <A HREF="../DMG/DD00621.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../DMG/DD00621.html">Dungeon Master Guide</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, Chapter 13). Because the opponent’s situation is painful or awkward or both,
the blindfighting proficiency does not reduce the penalties. Note that many
creatures cannot be blinded in an improvised attack because they have no eyes or
visual organs.
<P></P>
 The blinding effect lasts until the opponent clears his vision, which requires
a roll of 9 or less on 1d20. The opponent’s Wisdom/Willpower or
Dexterity/Balance score affects the roll—the DM decides which ability applies. The opponent
can attempt to clear his vision at the beginning of each round, but doing so
counts as a half move (see the <A HREF="../PHB/DD01698.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01698.html">Player’s Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, Chapter 9, or <A HREF="../CT/DD02417.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../CT/DD02417.html">Combat &amp; Tactics</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, Chapter 1).
<P></P>
 <I>Disarm: </I>If the attack is successful, the opponent must save vs. petrification or lose
the use of one weapon (because it is dropped or has become stuck in something).
Recovering a lost weapon takes a half move. If the weapon is stuck, the
opponent must make a successful open doors roll to get it free.
<P></P>
 <I>Immobilize: </I>If the attack succeeds, the opponent’s entire body becomes entangled or
trapped, and he must save vs. paralyzation or cease all meaningful movement. The
opponent remains unable to move or attack until he works free, which requires a
roll of 9 or less on 1d20. The creature’s Strength/Muscle or Dexterity/Aim score
applies to the roll—the DM decides which ability applies. The opponent can
attempt to get free at the beginning of each round, but doing so counts as a half
move.
<P></P>
 <I>Kill: </I>If the attack succeeds, the opponent suffers a critical injury that reduces
the creature’s hit points to –10 instantly unless the opponent saves vs. death
magic. If the save succeeds, there is no effect, but in some cases, the rogue can
force the opponent to save again the following round by winning initiative and
grappling the opponent. 
<P></P>
 For example, Jobare has attempted to kill an enemy warrior by slamming a
shutter down on his neck. The warrior’s saving throw was successful, but his head is
still caught under the shutter. Jobare can attempt a grappling attack to get
another chance to strangle the warrior.
<P></P>
 Opponents with more Hit Dice or who are higher level than the rogue are immune
to kill effects. In this instance, the thief inflicts normal damage.
<P></P>
 <I>Stun: </I>If the attack is successful, the opponent must save vs. breath weapon or
become stunned for 2d4 rounds. The character’s Constitution/Fitness adjustment
applies to the saving throw. A stunned character is unable to cast spells, attack,
or move at more than half speed. The character suffers a –2 penalty to Armor
Class, attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks while stunned.
<P></P>
 <I>Trip: </I>If the attack succeeds, the opponent suffers a misstep or other misfortune and
must save vs. petrification or fall down. Dexterity/Balance bonuses apply to
the saving throw. Creatures that fall while moving at speeds greater than 12
might suffer minor damage (1d3 or 1d6 points of damage, at the DM’s option). In
some cases, a fall might be inherently more dangerous, such as when a character
falls when climbing or stumbles onto a sharp object. If a fall could result in
instant death, use the rules for killing attacks instead. Getting up after a
fall counts as a half move.
<P></P>
 The improvised attack skill requires some imagination and role-playing ability
from the player. An improvised attack must be announced in a round’s player
declaration phase. During the resolution phase, the player must describe exactly
what unusual attack the rogue is employing—a simple called shot never qualifies
as an improvised attack. The rogue then makes a normal attack roll. Standard
combat modifiers apply, as does the rogue’s backstab bonus for rear attacks that
qualify. In most cases, the rogue’s missile bonus from Dexterity/Aim also
applies, because most improvised attacks rely on precision and fast movement.
Improvised attacks that involve a blow to the opponent are also subject to
Strength/Muscle bonuses.
<P></P>
 If the attack fails, the improvised attack has no effect. If the attack
succeeds, the opponent suffers no damage but must roll a saving throw or suffer the
improvised special effect. The cleverness and appropriateness of the attack
affects the saving throw as follows:
<P></P>

<P></P>
  +6 if the rogue player made no attempt to role-play or describe the attack.
For example, the player says, “I blind the dragon with an improvised attack.”
<P></P>

<P></P>
  +4 if the rogue player makes only a feeble attempt to role-play or describe
the attack. “Uh, I find some dirt and throw it in the dragon’s eyes”
<P></P>
  +2 to +6 if the attack described is physically unlikely to have the desired
effect. Trying to trip a horse with a staff is not likely to be effective.
<P></P>
 The save is automatic if the method described is completely inadequate. For
example, no character can strangle a great wyrm dragon with a 12-inch leather
thong, nor can a character blind a storm giant with a glob of oatmeal unless he
can reach the giant’s face.
<P></P>

<P></P>
  +2 if the rogue has used the same trick earlier in the adventure. The bonus
is +4 if the rogue has used the trick earlier in the same encounter, +6 if the
rogue has used the trick on the same creature during this adventure, and +8 if
the rogue has used the trick on the same creature this encounter. However, see
the note on establishing tricks, below.
<P></P>

<P></P>
  –2 if the opponent is surprised.
<P></P>

<P></P>
  –4 if the attack described is particularly appropriate. For example, causing
a fall from a wall by slamming a window down on the creature’s fingers,
entangling an opponent in a fishing net, blinding a creature by tricking it into
looking at a dusty object and then blowing the dust into its face, etc.
<P></P>

<P></P>
  The optional saving throw modifiers from <A HREF="DD01353.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01353.html">Table 36</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> or from <A HREF="DD01357.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01357.html">Table 38</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> can be applied to the saving throw if the DM wishes.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<I>Establishing a Trick: </I>If a rogue has successfully used the same improvised attack in three separate
adventures, the character can purchase the improvised attack skill the next
time he gains a level and make the trick a permanent part of the character’s
skills. An established trick can be used once per encounter without the usual
penalty for multiple use; situational penalties still apply. Using an established
trick does not count toward the character’s daily allotment of improvised attacks
unless the trick is used more than once in a single encounter, in which case
the multiple use penalties also apply. Opponents who have fought the rogue
previously and are prepared for an established trick gain a +6 saving throw bonus
against it.
<P></P>
 <I>An Example:</I> Jobare is collecting his ill-gotten gains after a game of chance in a seedy
inn. When one of the players demands his money back, Jobare asks the fellow to
hold out his hand. When the man complies, Jobare grabs his own feathered hat and
clamps it over the man’s face. The DM and the player agree that this is a
blinding attack. The DM decides that a roll for surprise is in order, as the man is
dutifully holding out his hand and not expecting attack. The man rolls a 2 on
the surprise die, indicating surprise. Jobare rolls a normal melee attack,
adjusts for his Dexterity/Aim score and the fact that the man is surprised. The
attack succeeds, and the DM rules that the man must save. vs. breath weapon at –2
or be blinded. His saving throw fails, giving Jobare an opportunity to escape.
<P></P>
 Later, Jobare has a special hat made that is lined with pleats of loose cloth
that allow the hat to unfold into a small bag, and it contains a springy
headband that helps hold the hat in place, whether the hat is on Jobare’s head or on
an opponent’s face. Jobare uses his trick hat several times, and when he gains

 By concentrating for one round and making a successful skill check, the rogue
can improve one of the three eligible ability scores to the value listed on the
table below. The improvement lasts one round per character level. Because the
majority of the character’s energy is directed to the improved ability score,
the other two ability scores are reduced by two points each. The rogue can end
the boost—and restore the values of the other two ability scores—at any time. If
the character’s ability score is already higher than the value listed on the
table, this skill has no effect. If the optional subabilities rule from <A HREF="../SP/DD02867.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../SP/DD02867.html">Skills &amp; Powers</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><I> </I>is in play, both subabilities in the increased ability score are raised to the

 The rogue can take no other actions during the round spent concentrating on
raising the selected ability score. Each attempt, successful or not, during a
single day lowers the base skill score by two.

 Bonuses from an increased score are applied immediately when the skill
succeeds and are immediately lost when the boost’s duration ends. Likewise, the
effects from reduced ability scores are applied immediately but then restored when
the improvement ends.

 A character can have only one ability score improvement from this skill
operating at any given time.

 This skill is also effective against the sense danger skill, the priest’s
detect deception skill, and the ability of intelligent or powerful creatures to
detect invisible opponents. When subjected to one of these powers, the rogue can
attempt an opposed Wisdom/Willpower check to remain undetected.

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sense Danger:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B> </B>This skill allows rogues to discover threats that are not obvious to less
perceptive characters. It is similar to the warrior skill of the same name, but
relies on the rogue’s intellect rather than on intuition and grants rogues a
slightly different set of sensing abilities.
<P></P>
 The sense danger skill is actually four different subskills, as outlined
below. The number of subskills the rogue knows depends on the character’s level: one
subskill at 16th–20th level, two subskills at 21st–25th level, and three
subskills at 26th–30th level. If the character purchases this skill twice, the rogue
gains one extra subskill. Any improvement to the skill number improves all the
subskills the character knows.
<P></P>
 Each subskill gives the rogue the ability to detect danger in a different form:
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <I>Ambushes: </I>The rogue can determine if hidden enemies are lurking in any area the
character can see well (see Table 62 in the <A HREF="../PHB/DD01768.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01768.html">Player’s Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">). The rogue can scan an area roughly 200 yards square in a single round. An
area can be scanned only once each turn, and a successful scan reveals
approximately how many creatures are hiding in the area and their approximate size.
<P></P>
 <I>Concealed Weapons: </I>The rogue can study a creature to determine if it has any concealed weapons. A
successful check reveals any weapons hidden about the creature’s person
(tucked into clothing, hidden nearby, etc). If faced with an unknown creature, a
successful skill check allows the rogue to determine what its attack modes are
(claws, teeth, etc.).
<P></P>
 When the rogue detects a concealed weapon with this skill, the character notes
its general size, location, and type—a sap tucked into the back of a
character’s breeches or a dagger hidden in a sleeve, for example. The character learns
nothing else about the weapon. Note that the rogue must be aware of the creature
before checking for concealed weapons—a rogue cannot attempt to search a
statue for concealed weapons because the player suspects it might be a golem. Unlike
the warrior’s version of this skill, a rogue can detect magically concealed
weapons.
<P></P>
 <I>Hostile Intentions: </I>A rogue can size up a living creature in plain sight and deduce its level of
hostility toward the rogue and his party. A successful roll gives the rogue a
general level of hostility: low (a suspicious merchant), medium (a thief from an
opposing guild), or high (caught by the local wizard with his <I>staff of the magi </I>in your backpack). Unlike the warrior ability, the rogue skill does not reveal
how well prepared for attack the creature is, just how much it would like to
attack. This skill does not indicate how likely a creature is to attack, since a
creature does not always act on its hostility.
<P></P>
 <I>Impending Attacks: </I>The rogue develops a sixth sense about weapons and other forms of attack aimed
at the character. Any time an undetected enemy is preparing an attack, the
rogue can attempt a skill check to receive a vague impression about the attacker’s
general direction (front, rear, left, right) and distance (close, far). In
many cases, the attacker’s identity is obvious from the information the skill
provides. A successful skill check gives the rogue a +2 bonus on surprise rolls and
a +1 bonus to the initiative roll during the first round of combat if the
character is not surprised. Unlike the warrior back protection subskill, the rogue
must turn to face the attacker to negate any applicable rear attack bonuses. If
the character is surprised in spite of this skill, the attacker receives all
bonuses normally applied to rear attacks, including backstab adjustments.
<P></P>
 With any subskill, the DM should roll the check secretly. If the roll fails on
a roll of 19 or less, the character detects nothing. If the roll fails on a
20, the character gets a false indication—improperly analyzing a creature’s level
of hostility, noting a concealed weapon where there is none, etc. A false
indication has no effect on an impending attack.
<P></P>
 If the character also has the alertness proficiency, he receives a +1 bonus to
his skill score.

 The rogue is visible when moving between shadows, but he remains hidden while
within the shadows and able to move at an accelerated rate until the character
attacks or the shadows get weaker. If the rogue leaves the shadows to attack,
the character can enter them again and resume accelerated movement on any round
when the rogue does not attack and there are shadows available. Shadow movement
is not silent, but the rogue can attempt a move silently roll while moving
through shadows and still move at the accelerated rate. Accelerated movement is
subject to normal modifiers for terrain and encumbrance.
