 Keep track of PC fame and infamy. It’s fun to watch players’ faces when they
hear exaggerated accounts of their characters’ early exploits. Imagine the
role-playing possibilities when they encounter a blowhard who claims to have known
them way back when—imagine the possibilities when they encounter a blowhard who
actually did know them way back when!
<P></P>
 Fame and infamy should have an effect on how PCs are received later on in
their careers. For example, characters who break their word too often find it
difficult to get land grants or honorifics such as knighthoods later in their
careers.
