 Magic is tricky and involves many constantly changing variables, causing each
enchantment to differ slightly from prior attempts. No matter how many times a
character has created a particular magical item, the chances for success remain
the same. A character’s general level of expertise can improve, but particular
enchantments cannot be mastered.

 Each attempt to create a magical item requires a roll for success. The DM
secretly rolls the dice to see if the attempt to create a magical item succeeds.
Any roll of 96–00 fails automatically.

 Most failed attempts ruin the item, melting it into useless slag or destroying
it in some other dramatic fashion. A failed attempt to write a spell on a
scroll fills the remaining space with a useless blob of ink, leaving spells already
successfully written intact.

 If the failure roll was a 96–00, the item appears to have been created
normally but has a cursed or reversed effect instead. The DM decides the nature of the
curse, using the cursed items from the magical item lists in the <A HREF="../DMG/DD00521.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../DMG/DD00521.html">Dungeon Master Guide</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> and <A HREF="../TM/DD04129.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../TM/DD04129.html">Tome of Magic</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> as a reference.
