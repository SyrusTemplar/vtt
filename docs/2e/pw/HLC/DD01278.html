</I></B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Antimagic Shell:</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This spell temporarily suppresses magic within its area of effect, but it
does not destroy or dispel enchantments or kill magical creatures. The spell has
no effect on golems, <I>simulacrums, clones,</I> or other constructs which are imbued with magic during their creation process
and are thereafter self-supporting. Most undead creatures are likewise
unaffected. Some of these creatures’ special abilities may be temporarily nullified,
however (see below). Any creature, including a golem or other construct, that is
conjured, summoned or from another plane of existence is hedged out of an <I>antimagic shell.</I> 
<P></P>
 An <I>antimagic shell</I> suppresses any spell or spell effect brought into or cast into the area of
effect. A hasted character, for example, is not hasted while he remains in the
area of effect. Permanent spells are not removed, but cannot be used to produce
magical effects within the area of effect. For example, a character who has been
resurrected is not harmed by an <I>antimagic shell</I>, but a character with a permanent tongues spell loses the ability to converse
in an unknown language while within the area of effect.
<P></P>
 An <I>antimagic shell </I>suppresses special attacks and innate abilities that function over a distance,
including breath weapons, gaze attacks, sonic attacks, and psionics, but not
touch-delivered special attacks such as energy draining or the corrosive effects
of green slime. A lich, for example, cannot employ spells within an <I>antimagic shell</I> and its ability to cause fear is suppressed, but its paralyzing touch is
still effective. Note that holy water is not magical and is fully effective within
an <I>antimagic shell</I>.
<P></P>
 An <I>antimagic shell</I> suppresses most potions and their effects; see the note at <A HREF="DD01286.html#d4fa1b2e"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01286.html#d4fa1b2e">potions</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> for details.

</I></B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Astral Spell:</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This spell sends a projection of the caster’s body into the Astral Plane. If
the caster elects to take other characters along, the spell creates projections
of them, too. An astral traveler can enter other planes while projecting, but
forms a new physical body, identical to the original, to do so.
<P></P>
 Only magical items are projected along with a traveler’s body, but normal
equipment can be rendered temporarily magical by casting <I>Nystul’s magical aura</I> , <I>continual light</I>, and other spells that temporarily imbue objects with magical  properties.
See <A HREF="DD01231.html#8da5ba9d"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01231.html#8da5ba9d">page 51</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> for a brief discussion of the effects planar travel has on magical items.
(The <I>Planescape</I> boxed set contains more details.)
<P></P>
 A traveler’s physical body falls into a deathlike trance and requires no food
or water while the caster is projecting. The physical forms of projected
magical items become inert on the Prime Material Plane. Damage to a traveler’s
physical body does not affect the projected form, but the character dies immediately
if his physical body is killed. Projected equipment vanishes if its physical
form is destroyed.
<P></P>
 Damage inflicted on an astral traveler’s projected form affects the character
normally. If a traveler is damaged when returning to his body the damage must
be healed normally.
<P></P>
 If an astral traveler dies, the character must attempt a system shock roll. If
the roll fails, the character dies and any items projected along with him
dissolve into nothingness. If the roll succeeds, the traveler is drawn back to his
original body and wakes up with one hit point. The process is debilitating and
the character cannot cast or memorize spells. The character can move at half
speed and fight and use proficiencies and other skills, but at a –4 penalty to
dice rolls. The restrictions and penalties remain until the character regains at
least half of his hit points.
<P></P>
 A successful <I>dispel magic</I> cast on a traveler’s physical body ends the spell, drawing the traveler back
to the Prime Material Plane without being otherwise harmed; any companions
accompanying the caster are likewise forcibly returned.
<P></P>
 While traveling through the Astral Plane, a projected form can move by pure
thought; a character’s astral movement rate is 30 times his Intelligence/Reason
score.

appear. Once created, the sensor cannot be moved.
<P></P>
 When placing the sensor, the caster must be precise and state the location in
terms he knows or are fairly obvious. For example, the caster cannot place the
sensor six inches from Ren the wizard’s left ear if he has no idea where Ren is
at the moment. He can place the sensor in the exact center of Ren’s laboratory
if he has a reasonable idea where the laboratory is located. A general
location for the sensor is permissible if the location is based on something known or
obvious to the caster. For example, the caster could specify the exact center
of the chamber beyond a closed door nearby.

</I></B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Dispel Magic:</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> A <I>dispel magic</I> spell cast directly upon an unattended magical item automatically renders the
item inoperable for 1d4 rounds. If <I>dispel magic</I> is cast upon an item that is in the possession of another creature, the item
is unaffected by the dispelling attempt if the creature makes a successful
saving throw versus spell. If the creature fails its saving throw, the item is
rendered inert for 1d4 rounds.
<P></P>
 Temporary effects from potions can be dispelled, see the section on <A HREF="DD01286.html#d4fa1b2e"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01286.html#d4fa1b2e">potions</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> for details.
<P></P>
 Permanent spells must be individually targeted to be dispelled, requiring a
separate <I>dispel magic</I> for each permanent effect. Unlike a magical item, a permanent spell is
destroyed, not temporarily rendered nonoperational, by a successful <I>dispel magic</I>. A creature or item never gains a saving throw to avoid a dispelling attempt
against its permanent effects, but the <I>dispel magic</I> is not automatically successful either. The caster of the <I>dispel magic</I> must still be of higher level than the caster of the <I>permanency </I>spell, and he must still make a successful dispelling roll. More detailed
information is found at the <I>permanency</I> spell description.
<P></P>
 Casting <I>dispel magic</I> on a creature or object does not radiate an area of effect. Thus, spells such
as <I>stoneskin, minor globe of invulnerability</I>, and <I>barkskin</I> could not be dispelled as the result of trying to negate the magic of a <I>wand of lightning</I>.
<P></P>
 Spells and potions whose basic durations are permanent cannot be dispelled. A <I>cure light wounds</I> spell or<I> potion of extra-healing,</I> cannot be dispelled after their healing properties have occurred. A <I>potion of heroism</I> could be negated while its effects were in operation, however.
<P></P>
 A successful <I>dispel magic</I> versus a 10th-level spell temporarily negates the spell’s effect for 1d4
rounds. It has no effect against a permanent 10th-level spell cast on a creature.

<P></P>
</I></B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>ESP:</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The caster perceives the subject’s surface thoughts—that is, whatever the
subject happens to be thinking about at the time. Note that close interrogation
might bring buried thoughts to the surface, but wary individuals can fight off
the probe and gain a saving throw against the spell. The subject’s Wisdom bonus
(or penalty) always applies to the saving throw, along with an additional bonus
of up to +4, at the DM’s option.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 The bonus depends on how closely the subject wants to guard the sought-after
information. In addition, even seemingly innocuous questions could reveal
information that the target of the spell desires to keep secret. In cases where there
is a conflict between the bonuses listed, always grant the higher bonus.
<P></P>
 Trivial matters merit no bonus. These include questions related to general
knowledge (What flag flies over the keep?) and personal questions whose answers
are obvious (What color is your hair?).
<P></P>
 A +1 bonus to the saving throw is warranted when the subject dislikes the
interrogator or if the questioner is asking non-threatening but potentially
embarrassing requests. For example, the subject is being prompted to reveal a minor
transgression, such as overcharging a customer, or admit a minor shortcoming,
such as fear of a spouse or military commander.
<P></P>
 A bonus of +2 is warranted if the interrogator is hostile to the subject or is
asking damaging questions. For example, the subject is prompted to reveal
indirectly harmful information, such as where personal treasure is hidden, or is
asked to betray a trust.
<P></P>
 A +3 bonus is granted if the interrogator has attacked the subject or is
asking seriously damaging questions. For example, the subject is being prompted to
reveal a secret vital to his future, such as military plans or trade secrets.
<P></P>
 A +4 bonus to the save is warranted if the interrogator has killed one of the
subject’s companions or is asking deeply personal or damaging questions. For
example, the subject is being prompted to reveal information vital to himself or
to someone important to him, such as the location of a family heirloom, an
employer’s daily routine, or a carefully guarded password.

</I></B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Feather Fall:</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This spell can be cast in reaction to a fall or a missile attack, provided
the caster has not already made an attack or cast a spell in the current round.
In the case of an attack, the caster must win initiative to complete the spell
before the missile arrives; use the normal initiative procedure from the <A HREF="../PHB/DD01687.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01687.html">Player’s Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">. In the case of a fall, the caster can be assumed to automatically cast this
spell at the beginning of any fall of 10 feet or more provided he is not
prevented from casting spells (silenced, gagged, etc.). 
<P></P>
 If the caster is falling an extreme distance (in excess of 120 feet/level),
the caster can opt to delay the <I>feather fall</I> spell so that its duration does not expire before the caster lands. When in
doubt about the caster’s ability to complete the spell before impact, roll
initiative. The caster makes a normal roll, adding +1 for the spell’s casting time,
and the DM rolls for the fall, adding +1 for each 120 feet of free fall. If the
caster loses the initiative roll, impact occurs before the spell is completed.
<P></P>
 This spell does not provide any method by which the spellcaster can determine
the length of a fall. Thus, a wizard falling into a lightless pit has no way to
determine if the fall is going to be 10 feet or 1,000 feet.

upon the recipient, which limits the user to turns totaling 180 degrees or less
per round. This might make it difficult for the user to negotiate a twisting
corridor at full speed. Once the flying character has completed his allowable
turns, he must either finish the round flying in a straight line or stop.

<P></P>
</I></B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Fear:</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> If made permanent, a fear spell causes the recipient to continually radiate a
fear aura.
<P></P>
 When cast on an area, a permanent fear effect creates a cone as described in
the spell description. The caster can orient the cone in any direction, but the
direction cannot be changed thereafter. Creatures entering the cone must save
vs. spells or flee for one round per level of the caster at the time the spell
was cast.
<P></P>
 When cast on an object or creature, the recipient radiates a cone of fear that
can be pointed in any direction the recipient desires once per round as though
wielding <I>a wand of fear</I>. Even though this attack requires no casting time or command word, it still
counts as an action for that round and has an initiative modifier of +3.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 In the permanent version, the caster is granted a limited ability to shape the
spell’s parameters to suit his needs. For example, a creature with a permanent
fear aura might be granted a gaze attack with a range of 10–60 feet, a touch,
or a continuous globe of fear with a radius of 5 to 20 feet.
<P></P>
 An object with a fear aura might cause fear when handled, shed continuous fear
in a 5- to 20-foot radius, or inspire fear when viewed clearly.
<P></P>
 Permanent fear on an area might affect creatures passing though a portal or
opening up to 60 by 60 feet, a cube of up to 30 feet per side, a sphere with a
radius of up to 20 feet, or a hemisphere with a radius of up to 25 feet. The
shape and dimensions of this spell cannot be changed once set.

A <I>haste </I>spell never magnifies the effects of magical items, such as <I>boots of speed</I> or a <I>potion of speed</I>.
<P></P>
 The one year of magical aging inflicted upon the recipients of this spell
requires the recipient to make a system shock roll (see <A HREF="../PHB/DD01429.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01429.html">Player’s Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, Chapter 1); failure results in death. This magical aging only occurs during
the first round of the spell’s effect, and multiple <I>haste </I>spells do not cause additional aging unless their effects overlap. For
example, casting an additional <I>haste</I> spell one round before an existing <I>haste</I> spell ends would cause another year of magical aging once the new spell took
effect.

</I></B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Identify: </I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Characters seeking to purchase magical items might employ this spell to get
some idea what they are buying. Remember that the spellcaster must spend the
eight hours preceding the casting of this spell purifying the items to be
identified. Most NPCs do not allow anyone to keep an item for that long; at least not
without a substantial advance payment. Dishonest sellers might pocket the advance
and disappear, leaving the PCs with a cursed or bogus item.
<P></P>
 The spell also requires the caster to handle the item, and a good way to keep
magic under control in a campaign is to require the caster to actually wear or
wield the item as it was intended. This requirement means some cursed items are
going to affect the caster.
<P></P>
 Be sure to impose the eight-point temporary Constitution loss the spell
inflicts (which provides enemies with an excellent opportunity to attack the weakened
spellcaster). Note that there is a limit to the number different magical
properties this spell can reveal during a single casting and that the exact number
of charges and magical pluses are never revealed.

invisible and remain so indefinitely. Any attack breaks the invisibility, but the
recipient can become invisible again during the next round. The return to
invisibility has an initiative modifier of +3, and the recipient can take no action
other than normal movement during a round in which he becomes invisible.

</I></B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Limited Wish:</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The magical aging inflicted by this spell is a function of the caster’s
natural life span. Typical aging is one year for a human, two years for a halfling
or half-elf, three years for dwarf, four years for a gnome, and five years for
an elf.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 This spell functions as a <I>wish</I> spell in most respects, but it cannot produce wealth or magical items. A<I> limited</I> <I>wish</I> can mimic the function of most other spells of 7th level or less. If used to
alter reality, the changes must be minor. For example, a single creature
automatically hits on its next attack, all opponents currently attacking the caster’s
party suffer a –2 attack penalty for the duration of the encounter, a single
creature regains 20–50% of lost hit points, or a single creature fails its next
saving throw are all possible uses for the spell.
<P></P>
 Major changes in reality persist for a limited duration, such as a single
creature regaining all lost hit points for 24 hours, a hostile creature becoming
cooperative for an hour, or an alert sentry falling asleep at his post.

likewise unaffected by exposure to a dispelling screen.

 Since this spell cannot focus its <I>dispel magic</I> effect, it cannot destroy permanent spells or negate the powers of magical
items.

If employed as a simple<I> polymorph other</I> or <I>stone to flesh</I> spell, the duration is permanent. If employed to turn a creature into an
object or an object into another object, the duration is measured in hours or
turns, as noted in the spell description.
<P></P>
 Generally, the duration should not be less than two hours or turns. A change
whose duration is measured in turns should not last more than a week, and a
change whose duration is measured in hours will not last more than a day. The more
radical the change, the shorter the duration. For example, turning a human into
a teacup involves a change of kingdom (animal to mineral), plus a change in
size and shape: This change might last 1d4+1 turns.

</I></B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Polymorph Other:</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This spell causes the target to assume the form of another creature of the
caster’s choosing. The caster cannot turn a creature into a plant or object. If
the recipient fails the saving throw against the spell, there is an immediate
system shock check to see if the creature survives the change. If the recipient
survives, the creature gains all the new form’s purely physical abilities, but
no abilities based on magic, agility, or intelligence. If the recipient’s
mentality changes to match the new form, the creature gains all the form’s abilities.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 If the caster chooses a form that cannot survive under the local conditions,
the recipient suffers 1d4 to 1d8 points of damage each day, hour, turn, or round
it is exposed to such conditions. For example, a goldfish in a desert might
suffer 1d8 points of damage every round from heat and dryness. The same goldfish
might suffer 1d6 points of damage every turn on a dungeon floor or 1d4 points
of damage every day in a frigid mountain pool. Some creatures might be immune to
environmental damage as long as their mentality remains intact. For example, a
mummy turned into a goldfish does not suffer from the desert heat.

normal mode of movement and breathing. The caster does not gain any special attacks
or unusual abilities. The spell description uses the form of an owl as an
example—the caster gains the ability to fly but not an owl’s extraordinary night
vision (which is a special ability).
<P></P>
 When deciding what abilities are gained, the DM can immediately rule out any
ability that does not arise from the form’s physical characteristics. For
example, a quickling’s speed comes from its magically accelerated metabolism and is
not derived purely from its physical form.
<P></P>
 In general, the DM should consider any non-flying movement rate of greater
than 24 or flying movement rate of greater than 36 as a special ability.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 The caster can assume the forms of creatures he has personally seen. For
example, a caster who has never seen an ochre jelly cannot change into one.

 Placing another extradimensional space inside the area created by a <I>rope trick</I> spell has catastrophic effects, see the note at extradimensional spaces in

is not magical or mental in nature. For example, a character who changes into
an owl gains its night vision, but changing into a cockatrice does not grant
the monster’s petrifying touch. The spell does not bestow magic resistance.

Multiple <I>stoneskins </I>placed on a single creature are not cumulative. If two or more <I>stoneskin</I> spells are cast on the same creature, roll normally for the number of attacks
each spell protects against. If a new spell protects against more attacks than
the present spell does, the recipient gets the benefit of the increased
protection; otherwise there is no effect. The caster does not necessarily know how
many attacks the spell can shield him from.
<P></P>
 <I>Stoneskin</I> protects only against blows, cuts, pokes, and slashes directed at the
recipient. It does not protect against falls, magical attacks, touch-delivered special
attacks (such as touch-delivered spells, energy draining, green slime, etc.),
or nonmagical attacks that do not involve blows (such as flaming oil, ingested
or inhaled poisons, acid, constriction, and suffocation). <I>Stoneskin</I> lasts for 24 hours or until the spell has absorbed its allotment of attacks.

there can be an error even if the caster travels to well-known locations.
Additional notes regarding the definition of a well-known location are found under
the <I>teleport without error </I>listing.
<P></P>
 Even minor alterations to a site can affect the caster’s knowledge of a
location. For example, Rozmare has spent many hours in her study, and the DM allows
her to use the “very familiar” category when determining how accurate her
teleport spells are when her study is the destination. If a rival breaks in and
rearranges the furniture, however, Rozmare’s knowledge falls to “studied carefully”
or worse because she is not as familiar with the way things are currently
arranged. If the intruder removed all the furniture and filled the study with
boulders, Rozmare’s knowledge falls to the “never seen” category.
<P></P>
 Some players might attempt elaborate precautions to protect their characters
from the disastrous effects of failed <I>teleport</I> spells; as the DM, you should not discourage such efforts, but keep the
following in mind:
<P></P>
 A <I>teleport</I> spell requires a firm surface as a destination. The caster cannot choose to
appear in the air or in a pool of water to avoid teleporting low. It is
possible, however to teleport to a firm surface with a space or water underneath. If a
teleporting character arrives low, roll 1d100 to see how many yards below the
surface the caster’s feet land. Note that a low <I>teleport</I> is always fatal if the caster arrives within any solid object no matter how
thin or flimsy the object is; teleporting low into a pile of feathers is just as
deadly as teleporting into rock. Teleporting low into water is not immediately
fatal, but the character still might drown if he can’t hold his breath until
he reaches the surface.
<P></P>
 A permanent <I>teleport</I> spell affects a single object with a volume of no more than 1,000 cubic feet
(a 10-foot cube) or an area no larger than 400 square feet (20 feet square).
The caster names the destination and rolls once for accuracy. The destination
cannot be changed once set. The caster can assign a command word or non-verbal
triggering device if he desires. This can be as simple or complex as the caster
desires; see the <I>magic mouth</I> spell description in the <A HREF="../PHB/DD01878.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01878.html">Player’s Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> for limitations. If no command or trigger is set, anyone passing through the
area or touching the object is teleported.
<P></P>
 Usually, only one creature can be teleported each round. It is possible to
have several creatures teleport simultaneously provided they are touching the
first creature to trigger the teleport and the additional creatures and their
equipment do not exceed the spell’s weight limit, which is the same as the caster’s
weight limit at the time the original spell was cast.
<P></P>

<P></P>
If a permanent <I>teleport</I> spell is inaccurate, both the <I>permanency </I>and the <I>teleport</I> spell fail, but the caster can attempt a system shock roll to avoid losing a
point of Constitution.  If this option is in play, the caster also might be
allowed to set multiple destinations with the same permanent <I>teleport</I> spell.  The caster must name a different trigger for each destination and
roll for accuracy each time a trigger is set.

</I></B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Teleport Without Error:</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> As with<I> teleport</I>, this spell only allows travel to known locations. To know a location, the
caster must learn what the place looks like or must be able to surmise where it
is. For example, if the caster has been blindfold, carried into a chamber, then
allowed to look around, the character could use<I> teleport without error</I> to return to the chamber even though he has no idea where the chamber is. The
caster also could <I>teleport without error</I> into the courtyard of a castle visible in the distance even if he had never
seen the courtyard before. Note that in both cases the caster could employ a
normal <I>teleport</I> spell, but the caster’s lack of knowledge about the destination would make
the attempt dangerous.
<P></P>
 A<I> teleport without error</I> spell has no chance for error if the destination lies in the same world as
the caster. If the caster accidentally specifies a destination already occupied
by a solid object, the character is automatically displaced a sufficient
distance to allow for a safe arrival.
<P></P>
 <I>Teleport</I> <I>without error</I> also allows travel between world (planes, crystal spheres, and pocket
dimensions) but there is a chance for error, see the <A HREF="DD01278.html#68f4579c"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01278.html#68f4579c">spell description</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> for details.

For example, an unseen servant can be sent to the bottom of a pool to grab

<P></P>
 The permanent version of this spell creates an invisible servant that always
hovers within 30 feet of the caster. If destroyed, it reforms in 2d10 rounds.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 A permanent <I>unseen servant </I>can be cast on an area and instructed to endlessly perform a single task, such

blunder into permanent webbing (or who are thrown in) can be trapped and suffocated

</I></B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><I>Wish:</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Most uses of this spell lower the caster’s Strength/Stamina score by three
points and force the caster to take to his bed for 2d4 days. Lost
Strength/Stamina returns at the end of the rest period. If the caster’s Strength score falls
to 0 or less, he loses consciousness until he has rested. 
<P></P>
 A <I>wish</I> essentially allows the user to change reality to suit his tastes. The
alteration, however, can have unintended consequences, especially if the wish is
poorly worded or the caster gets greedy. Generally, the more local and personal the
effect, the less chance there is for complications. Adjudicating this spell is
tricky, as the DM must be sure to give the players results that reflect the
power of the <I>wish</I>, but not so much that the players come to rely on <I>wishes </I>to solve all their problems. A <I>wish </I>can always duplicate any spell of 9th level or less.
<P></P>
 To avoid the bed rest and Strength/Stamina loss associated with a <I>wish </I>spell, the caster must effect a change that does not leave him better off than
before the events that preceded the <I>wish</I>. For example, if the wizard’s party was defeated by a powerful monster, the
caster could <I>wish </I>that they had never met the creature. This change in reality brings his
companions back to life as if the encounter had never occurred. The caster ages five
years, but he does not have to rest for 2d4 days from the <I>wish </I>since he is not in a better position than before the events occurred.
<P></P>
 If the caster wished for his party to return but the monster to remain dead,
he would be subject to the debilitative effects, since the creature being dead
is considered an advantage that the spellcaster did not have before the events
occurred. Any time a <I>wish </I>creates an advantage for the caster the loss of Strength and the 2d4 days of
bed rest occurs.
<P></P>
 The effective power of a <I>wish </I>is based upon the availability of money and magical items in your campaign
world. If these are in abundance, the power of the wish is enhanced. Likewise, in
a world where money and magical items are scarce, the power of a wish is
reduced. As DM, you need to determine the relative power of a <I>wish </I>in your world. Here are a few guidelines for a world that has a moderate
amount of wealth and magical items:
<P></P>
 A <I>wish </I>can produce a magical item but not an artifact. To avoid suffering bed rest
and Strength loss, the caster should place a limit on the length of time the item
is kept, typically about one hour. The item isn’t actually created, it’s just
borrowed and goes back where it came from when the duration expires. If the
item is particularly rare or valuable, or has been borrowed before, the true owner
might resent the loan.
<P></P>
 A <I>wish </I>can bring the user wealth. The DM should decide how much a character can <I>wish</I> for without trouble. The amount gained should be significant but not so great
as to disrupt the game. For most campaigns, a random amount of 5,000 to 40,000
gp (5d8x1,000) shouldn’t cause problems.
<P></P>
 A <I>wish </I>can change a character’s race permanently, allowing an elf to become a human
and advance without level limitations. Alternatively, that same elf could <I>wish </I>to advance in level like a human, but he could at most gain one level per <I>wish</I>. Each time he wanted to advance in level, he would have to cast another <I>wish </I>to allow it to occur.
<P></P>
 A <I>wish </I>can usually negate or change events that the user finds undesirable—this is
why <I>wishes</I> are part of the AD&amp;D game. A <I>wish </I>used to alter a campaign’s history should be immediate—made on the spot or
very soon after the event to be altered took place. <I>Wishes </I>that allow player characters a second chance to achieve a goal after an
unlucky failure or disastrous mistake should be allowed, as long as the terms of the
wish don’t guarantee success.
<P></P>
 When assigning consequences to poorly worded or inappropriate <I>wishes</I>, it is best to follow two guidelines: First, the errant <I>wish</I> should follow the player’s wording to the letter. Second, the result should
follow the path of least resistance; that is, the result should involve the
simplest and least complex warping of reality. For example, a greedy character who
tries to <I>wish</I> for a <I>staff of the magi</I> might very well find himself standing naked and alone, staff in hand, in
front of the staff’s former owner (perhaps a dragon or lich). Escaping from the
former owner and returning home is the character’s problem.
<P></P>
 As with <I>limited wish</I>, the unnatural aging caused by the spell is dependent upon the race of the
caster; five years for a human, 10 years for a halfling or half-elf, 15 years for
a dwarf, 20 years for a gnome, and 25 years for an elf. The aging requires a
system shock roll, and failure results in death for the caster.
