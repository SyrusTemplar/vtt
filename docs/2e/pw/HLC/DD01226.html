</B>World Hopping  </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A visit to a foreign land, long or short, is seldom routine. Dealing with
strange customs, unfamiliar laws, and unusual foods can give even hardened
travelers fits. Now imagine what it might be like to visit a place where the very
underpinnings of reality are different from home. That’s what world hopping is like.
<P></P>
 Staging adventures on unfamiliar worlds is a great way to keep a high-level
campaign fresh and challenging. Players become very attentive once they find they
can take nothing for granted, and even fairly weak creatures can challenge the
party when the PCs’ spells and magical items begin to act in unanticipated
ways. This section presents some quick guidelines for creating alternate worlds
for your adventures. This section is by no means complete—the possibilities are
limited only by your imagination.
