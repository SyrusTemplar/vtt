</B>Warriors</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">  High-level warriors are formidable killing machines, especially when
equipped with magical weapons and armor. Although their THAC0 ceases to improve once
they reach level 20, they continue to receive extra proficiencies and hit points
until level 30. In addition, warriors automatically receive special powers
beginning at 21st level. These abilities vary according to the warrior’s subclass.
All warriors also have access to a host of special skills beginning at level
10.
