 Get into the habit of creating brief descriptions for most of the scenes in
your adventure. Include sensory details such as colors, smells, textures, sounds,
and the like. The sensory information helps make your world more believable
and tangible to your players. Once you become skilled in describing your world in
sensory terms, it is easier to slip subtle clues about the adventure to your
players.
<P></P>
 The same rule applies to spells. Instead of telling the player what he sees
with his <I>detect magic</I> spell, explain the varying hues and colors associated with the magic he is
viewing.<I> Detect undead</I> could produce nausea, and that immense globe of fire hurtling toward the
party could be either a<I> fireball </I>or a <I>delayed blast fireball</I>. 
<P></P>
 Adding sensory details also makes it much easier to control the mood of the
adventure. Not only do players feel the sense of urgency building, they are able
to smell the ozone from the last <I>chain lightning</I> spell that tore into them.
