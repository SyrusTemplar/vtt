</B>2. Intelligent Adversaries</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">  You can challenge your campaign’s high-level player characters without
making every monster and villain in your world a killing machine. In a well-run
game, what you decide to do with your bad guys is far more important than their raw
power. Try to think beyond the simple all-out assault by a mass of expendable
foes. High-level characters have little to fear from such attacks, and their
players generally expect more originality and ingenuity from their DM. This
section contains a few tips for getting the most out of any adversary your PCs face.
