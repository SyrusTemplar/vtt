</B>An Example of Magical Dueling</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>

<P></P>
<I> Calvin and Delsenora decide to conduct a friendly duel. Tarrant, a local
wizard, agrees to mediate.
<P></P>
 Calvin and Delsenora agree that the first character to run out of spells or
hit points is the loser. Calvin has a </I>ring of spell storing<I>, which the two characters agree should count toward Calvin’s total spells.
Both characters agree that no other magical items are going to be used in the
duel, and Tarrant looks them over to check for any scrolls or other items.
<P></P>
 The trio finds a secluded spot, and Calvin and Delsenora begin creating the
arena. When they finish the first step, Tarrant encloses the pair in an </I>Otiluke’s resilient sphere<I>; he chooses to remain outside the sphere.
<P></P>
 When Tarrant casts his spell, Delsenora and Calvin consider adding their own
spells. Both characters decide not to contribute spells, and the arena is
completed. There are 10 spaces between the characters (see figure M1). Because
neither character cast a spell, both characters roll 1d10 to see who has the
advantage—Calvin wins the roll.
<P></P>
 During the first round of the duel, there are no spells to move, so both
characters cast spells. Calvin decides to try to get a lick in quickly and casts </I>clairvoyance <I>(L, PR 12, MV 5). The spell appears in the space in front of Calvin and does
not move. Delsenora decides to cast withdraw (D, PR 11, MV 1) in her own square
as a stationary defense.
<P></P>
 On the second round, Calvin moves his </I>clairvoyance <I>spell five spaces toward Delsenora. Because Delsenora cast withdraw in her own
square, it doesn’t move at all. Now Calvin casts </I>monster summoning II <I>(AD, PR 13, MV 3) from his </I>ring of spell storing<I>. Delsenora casts </I>dispel magic <I>(AD, PR 12, MV 4). Both spells appear in the squares in front of their casters.
<P></P>
 On the third round, things really start hopping. Calvin has the advantage, so
his spells move first. His </I>clairvoyance<I> spell is closest to Delsenora, so it moves first. The spell has enough
movement to reach Delsenora’s space, but her </I>dispel magic <I>spell is in the way. When the spells meet, Delsenora must announce that her
spell is an attack/defense because she is disadvantaged. Calvin checks <A HREF="DD01299.html"></A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="DD01299.html">Table 25</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><I> and sees that the advantaged caster decides if combat is going to occur.
Calvin decides not to fight; he is not required to reveal anything about his spell.
<P></P>
 The </I>clairvoyance <I>spell finishes its move and enters Delsenora’s square. The </I>clairvoyance <I>spell is revealed, and it must check for combat with the withdraw spell before
it can affect Delsenora. Because he has the advantage, Calvin could normally
decide his leech spell would ignore the defense spell. But, withdraw has a
special ability that forces leeches and missiles to fight it.
<P></P>
 Both characters roll 1d20. Calvin rolls a 20 and curses his luck. Delsenora
rolls a 9. The </I>clairvoyance <I>spell is destroyed, and the advantage shifts to Delsenora, but Calvin still
finishes moving his spells; he moves his </I>monster summoning III <I>ahead three spaces. Delsenora moves her </I>dispel magic<I> ahead four spaces, and the two characters cast spells again.
<P></P>
 Calvin casts </I>magic missile<I> (M, PR 10, MV 5), and Delsenora casts </I>animate object<I> (AD, PR 15, MV 3).
<P></P>
 The duel continues, with Calvin trying to breech Delsenora’s defenses and
strike a telling blow before she can crush him under the weight of her more
plentiful spells. Calvin could be in trouble if the </I>animate object<I> spell reaches his space, which it might very well do with the </I>dispel magic<I> leading the way.
