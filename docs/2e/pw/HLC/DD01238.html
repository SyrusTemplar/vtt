</B>Monsters </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> An AD&amp;D campaign is not complete without hordes of monsters to battle. No
other foe is as useful for giving player characters violent and implacable foes
whose savage and often alien natures make their complete and utter defeat a
necessity. Monstrous foes are good for keeping characters guessing about exactly
what they’re up against, and monsters come pre-equipped with arrays of natural
weaponry that the PCs cannot carry off with them after a battle.
<P></P>
 High-level characters can easily defeat most standard monsters, because the
monsters usually have been designed with weaker characters in mind.

planning can come to nothing if the characters can obliterate every enemy as soon
as blows and spells are exchanged in an encounter.

 A high-level campaign shouldn’t be so overrun with super monsters that
low-level characters and commoners have no chance to survive, but sometimes it is
helpful to give the monsters a party meets a little bit of an edge. Perhaps you
have introduced an unexplored continent or plane where life is hard and everything
is a little tougher than usual. Or perhaps you simply need bigger, nastier
version of a standard monster to lead a band of lesser creatures.
<P></P>
 There might also be times when you wish to introduce a monster that is a little<I> weaker</I> than a typical specimen. Just how nasty are the baby bulettes in that nest
(and how much of a fight can they put up before mom arrives)? The sections below
offer a few methods for doing so without going to the drawing board and
inventing a host of brand new creatures.
