 Create situations where the PCs have saving throw penalties so that item saves
become more common. A few pesky leprechauns are great for removing unwanted
items from a campaign, either by stealing them or polymorphing them into bizarre
shapes (or both). It’s also possible to create situations where PCs might
accidentally lose items. 
<P></P>
 For example, characters who fall overboard during a storm at sea might have a
hard time holding onto all their equipment, and the bottom of the ocean is not
terribly easy to search. Characters who annoy deities might suddenly find that
their favorite items no longer work properly. Be careful not to overdo it.
Offhandedly zapping a character’s favorite sword is churlish, but a closet full of<I> long swords +1</I> is fair game.
