</B>Beyond 30th Level  </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">All character advancement stops at 30th level, which represents the pinnacle
of mortal achievement. At this level, even a wizard has more hit points than
five normal men and characters of any class have powers greater than the avatars
that deities use to conduct business in the mortal world. Once a character has
gotten this far, there is nowhere else to go. Or is there?
