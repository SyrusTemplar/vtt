<P></P>
 Barring some special circumstance that makes a saving throw unnecessary, such
as a successful magic resistance roll or immunity to a particular attack form,
there is always a chance that a character can fail a saving throw. All
characters and most other creatures fail their saving throws on rolls of 3 or less on
1d20, no matter how many bonuses they receive to the roll from magical items,
spells, ability scores, and the like.
<P></P>
 Some beings have lower failure numbers: Lesser deities fail their saving
throws on rolls of 2 or less, intermediate deities fail on rolls of 1, and greater
deities need not roll at all—they never fail their saving throws.

 In a few cases, Table 60 from the <A HREF="../PHB/DD01724.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01724.html">Player’s Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><I> </I>and Table 36 from this book show a saving throw success number of 3 or less;
these numbers refer to the character’s adjusted die roll, not the actual number
rolled. For example, Wulf, a 21st-level priest, has a saving throw number of 2
against paralyzation, poison, or death magic. Wulf still automatically fails
his saving throw against these attacks if his actual die roll is a 1, 2, or 3.
However, if he encounters a particularly virulent poison that imposes a –3
penalty to the saving throw, his saving throw succeeds if Wulf rolls a 5 or higher on
his saving throw die. (The roll, 5, is higher than the automatic failure
number, and still equals a 2 after the –3 modifier is applied.)
