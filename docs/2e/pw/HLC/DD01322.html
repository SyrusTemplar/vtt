 Characters who have the required level and ability score are not necessarily
free to gather up materials and begin creating super-magical effects as they see
fit. The DM must approve a spell before it is used. The player should explain
exactly what the spell does, just as if the character were researching a new
spell or inventing a new magical item. There is no cost for creating a true
dweomer, however, other than what the character spends on materials.
