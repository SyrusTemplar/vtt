 Keep track of who the PCs’ friends and enemies are. Pay attention to the way
player characters interact with important nonplayer characters in your world.
Rivalries, favors, and even romances can be a great source of information.
<P></P>
 Remember too that friends sometimes call in favors as well as grant them to
the PCs. Heroes who constantly called upon favors earlier in their careers may
spend many years repaying those acts of kindness.
