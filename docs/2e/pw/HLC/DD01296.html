<P></P>
 When the arena is complete, the opponents fight by casting spells. The spells
emanate from the characters’ images, and their effects become mental constructs
that move across the arena and battle opposing spells along the way.
<P></P>
 To help keep track of spells cast during a duel, it is helpful to use some
kind of large grid. The reusable sheets used for conducting combat encounters with
miniature figures are ideal. Place a miniature or counter for each combatant
on the grid with the appropriate number of spaces between them.
<P></P>
 A duel is fought in rounds, just like a normal encounter. The sequence of
actions in each round is as follows:
<P></P>

<P></P>
1. The advantaged caster’s spells move and any resulting combats are conducted. 
<P></P>

<P></P>
2. The disadvantaged caster’s spells move and any resulting combats are conducted.
<P></P>

<P></P>
3. Both casters cast new spells.
<P></P>

<P></P>
4. Steps 1–3 are repeated until the duel ends.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 On the first round of the duel, there is no spell movement because there are
no spells in the arena.
