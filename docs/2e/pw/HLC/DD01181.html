 Encourage the players to develop long-term goals for their characters.
High-level characters need more motivation than the simple pursuit of wealth and
experience. If a character has some intangible goal, such as political power, social
status, or enduring fame, the campaign can offer more rewards for clever play.
In some cases, the PCs might end an adventure weaker and poorer than they
started, and the players still feel a sense of accomplishment if they make some
progress toward a personal goal.
<P></P>
 Not every goal is realized in a campaign, especially in the case of
far-reaching requests. Characters desiring to control vast stretches of the world under a
distinct rule probably spend their entire lives trying to accomplish it.
Campaigns should be built around character goals and ambitions, but it should never
be ruled by overzealous or selfish desires.
