works together. Even disorganized groups usually contain one individual that
the rest of the group looks up to. Remember that you don’t have to have legions
of Einsteins to fight well, just one clever or experienced leader.
<P></P>
 Groups without strong leaders tend to have difficulty working together, though
they still can be effective in combat if the individuals are fairly bright and
spirited. Coordinated actions usually give better results than individual
actions. For example, pairs of creatures or small subgroups can watch each other’s
backs and divide up tasks such as guarding against flanking maneuvers and
keeping the pressure on the foe’s commanders, spellcasters, and missile users.
