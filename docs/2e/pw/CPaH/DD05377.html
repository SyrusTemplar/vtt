  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The paladin, so thoroughly aligned with 
   the forces of good, can experience the mere <I>presence</I> of evil 
   as a physical sensation. Although similar to the <I>detect evil</I> 
   spell, the paladin's sensitivity to evil essentially functions as a 
   sixth sense. But, like the spell, this ability doesn't work 
   automatically. The player must make it clear that the paladin is 
   attempting to detect evil; only then will the DM reveal the relevant information.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Use and Limitations</B></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike other senses, the detection of 
   evil works only when the paladin concentrates for one full round, 
   remaining still and taking no other actions. Often, paladins close 
   their eyes, lower their head, and clear their minds by focusing on 
   their own breathing. Some paladins extend their palms, touch their 
   foreheads with their fingers, or sweep their hands slowly in front of 
   them. Details of the concentration routine vary from paladin to 
   paladin, and each is free to come up with a unique routine. Once 
   settled on a routine, the paladin should always execute it the same way.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If attacked, distracted, or otherwise 
   disturbed while concentrating, the paladin fails to detect evil. He 
   may try again in subsequent rounds.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The paladin may target an individual or 
   group up to 60 feet distant, in an area about 10 feet wide, or a 
   location where an individual or group might be hiding, such as a 
   clump of bushes or a concealed alcove. The paladin must face the 
   indicated individual, group, or location, but need not see the 
   target. If blindfolded or in thick fog, for example, the paladin can 
   target an individual by voice or movement, or just take a guess. In a 
   shadowed corridor, the paladin's detect-evil ability can determine if 
   anyone&#151;or anything&#151;with strong evil intent lurks in the darkness.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Eligible Targets</B></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A paladin can detect evil radiated by 
   characters and monsters; undead created by evil magic; Negative Plane 
   influences; evil artifacts; certain enchanted swords; and other 
   intelligent objects that radiate evil. The ability can't detect 
   cursed objects or traps, nor does it work on creatures of Animal 
   intelligence or less (Intelligence 0 or 1), such as centipedes or 
   carnivorous plants.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The paladin's sensitivity to evil 
   responds to the target's intention to commit an evil act. The ability 
   doesn't reveal the precise nature of the intended act, nor does it 
   reveal the target's actual alignment. Characters who are strongly 
   aligned, who do not stray from their faith, and are of at least 9th 
   level might radiate evil if intent upon appropriate actions. For 
   instance, if the paladin uses this ability on a suspicious nonplayer 
   character, the paladin may sense that the NPC radiates evil, but not 
   that the NPC is neutral evil, or that the NPC plans to ambush and 
   kill the paladin. If an NPC recently murdered a passerby, the paladin 
   might pick up evil emanations from the NPC but cannot determine the 
   nature of the crime. Creatures such as the rakshasa, who disguise 
   themselves with illusions, may conceal their appearances but not 
   their evil intentions.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A high-level character unshakably 
   committed to an evil alignment may radiate evil even when not 
   specifically planning an evil act or thinking evil thoughts. Powerful 
   evil monsters, such as red dragons and hill giants, also radiate evil 
   uncontrollably. A paladin can always detect the presence of these 
   types of evil beings, unless unusual conditions are in effect. For 
   instance, in some evil strongholds or planes, <I>everything</I> reads 
   evil, effectively negating the paladin's evil-sensing ability.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject creatures may not make saving 
   throws to resist a paladin's attempt to sense evil. However, <I>undetectable
    alignment</I> and similar spells cast on a target temporarily 
   prevent the paladin from sensing the target's evil emanations. But as 
   soon as the spell ends, the paladin is free to make another attempt.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A paladin can't detect an evil presence 
   through 3 feet or more of wood, 1 foot or more of stone, or 1 inch or 
   more of metal. A thin coat of lead also prevents the use of this 
   ability. A paladin perceives such barriers as nonspecific 
   obstructions, without knowing their composition or widths.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Interpreting the Results</B></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If an attempt at sensing evil fails, or 
   if there's no evil present, the paladin feels nothing out of the 
   ordinary. If evil is present, the paladin might experience an 
   unmistakable physical sensation. Though the type of sensation varies 
   among paladins, a given paladin always has the same reaction. Typical 
   reactions include tingling in the fingertips, a warm flush, a cold 
   chill, or a dull throb behind the eyes; the DM can make up 
   sensations. Usually the sensation lasts only a moment.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If the paladin scans a crowd of people, 
   tingling fingers won't pinpoint the character responsible for the 
   evil emanations. If scanning a pool of murky water, throbbing eyes 
   won't reveal the number or species of evil creatures lurking below 
   the surface. However, the paladin may determine the degree of evil 
   from the intensity of the sensation. Table 11 lists four general 
   degrees and examples of sources. Two ways that a paladin might 
   experience the corresponding sensations also appear. In an encounter, 
   the DM describes only the sensation when a paladin successfully 
   detects evil; the player must interpret the meaning of the sensation.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; At the DM's option, the paladin may 
   discover the general nature of the evil as well as its degree. A 
   pickpocket may radiate an expectant evil, a vampire's evil may be 
   malignant. The DM may use the sensations suggested in Table 11 to 
   indicate the nature of evil (the paladin experiences an expectant 
   evil as an itch on his fingertips), or may employ a different set of 
   sensations (a warmth in the chest indicates expectant evil).</FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Ambiguous situations produce ambiguous 
   results. If a vampire waits behind a 3-inch-thick stone wall 
   fortified with 2 feet of wood, a paladin may detect a moderate or 
   strong sensation of evil, rather than an overwhelming one. If a 
   murderer hides behind a window with a coat of flaking lead paint, a 
   paladin may detect a moderate instead of a strong sensation.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If the DM can't decide which category in 
   Table 11 to use, it's acceptable to give the paladin mixed signals. 
   If a vicious mugger hides in a closet, but plans to surrender rather 
   than fight if discovered, a paladin may detect both faint and 
   moderate sensations (fingertip itches alternating with pinpricks).</FONT></P>
