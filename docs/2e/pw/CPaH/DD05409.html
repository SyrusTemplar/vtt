<P></P>
<B>   Description:</B> Historically, a Squire functioned as an apprentice, serving his master both
at home and on the battlefield while honing his skills. When his training ended,
the Squire became a paladin himself, sometimes continuing the cycle by taking
on a Squire of his own.
<P></P>
   Occasionally, however, Squires made a career of service. By choice or
circumstance, the Squire has spent his life as an aide to a high-ranking paladin, an
elder of his church, or a government official. Although never quite attaining the
status of other paladins, the career Squire—the type described in this
kit—commands respect for his loyalty and devotion to duty.
<P></P>
   <B>Requirements:</B> There are no rigid requirements for a Squire, but the player should consider
why the character would opt for this kit, which offers less status than a full
paladin but demands the same adherence to an ethos. Some possibilities include:
<P></P>
 • The character doesn't want all the responsibilities associated with a full
paladin.
<P></P>
 • The character lacks the noble blood required of full paladins in his culture.
<P></P>
 • The character's paladin ancestor committed an ethos violation so severe that
his descendants were forbidden to become  full paladins.
<P></P>
   The player may also name the master his Squire will serve. The master is
usually a high-level paladin, but can also be an aristocrat, a military officer, or
a church dignitary. The master may be another PC, but this isn't recommended,
as complications may arise if the PC master is unavailable for a particular
adventure or drops out of the campaign.
<P></P>
   Preferably, the player should select an NPC paladin to be the Squire's master,
approved of and controlled by the DM. For convenience and expediency, the NPC
operates &quot;offstage&quot;—that is, he rarely, if ever, makes an actual appearance in
the campaign. The master may be infirm, permanently confined to bed in his
stronghold, or perhaps his duties have indefinitely taken him to the other side of
the world. Squire and master communicate through messengers or intermediaries,
or they may arrange meetings between adventures. Alternately, the master may be
dead; rather than finding a new master, the Squire dedicates the rest of his
career to the master's memory. In any case, the Squire carries out the master's
wishes, looks after his interests, and represents him in quests and adventures.
<P></P>
<B>   Ministration:</B> A Squire takes orders from his master. If the master is dead, the Squire
obeys the master's heir.
<P></P>
<B>   Role:</B> A Squire performs household chores, cares for horses, and maintains weapons.
If he has the appropriate skills, he may also cook meals, repair clothing, or
do leatherwork. These functions may be part of his regular duties, or he may
take it upon himself to help out; Squires are eager to pitch in when there's work
to be done.
<P></P>
   Despite their reputation for dedication and hard work, Squires lack the
stature of other paladins. They are rarely invited to state banquets or other formal
functions, except as waiters or chefs. They never become high-ranking military
officers, nor are they eligible for the honors available to other paladins. (If
a Chevalier and a Squire are equally responsible for defeating an enemy army,
the Chevalier may receive a festival in his honor and a gift of a golden spurs;
the Squire may have to settle for a pat on the back.) While commoners respect
the Squire, open admiration is rare; unfairly or not, many believe that career
Squires have some deficiency that prevents them from becoming full-fledged
paladins.
<P></P>
   A Squire's party finds him a tireless worker and supportive companion. He
graciously volunteers his aid to whomever needs it; he's always willing to repair a
torn tunic for a comrade who can't sew, groom the horse of a friend who's too
tired to do it himself, or teach a novice the way to hold a shield. He avoids
leadership roles, deferring to those in authority positions, but follows orders
to the letter. No job is too menial, no request too trivial.
<P></P>
 <B>  Symbol: </B>The Squire adopts the same symbol as his master.
<P></P>
   <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Armorer, Groom, Tailor/Weaver, Weaponsmith, Woodworker/Carpenter.
<P></P>
<B>   Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Any.
<P></P>
   <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Recommended:</I> Armorer, Blacksmithing, Brewing, Carpentry, Cobbling, Cooking, Etiquette,
Leatherworking, Seamstress/Tailor, Weaponsmithing, Weaving.
<P></P>
<B>   Armor/Equipment:</B> Standard. The master will usually supply all basic equipment at no charge,
including a suit of chain mail, a short sword, a lance, a dagger, a mount
(usually a riding horse or light war horse), and tack. Unless the Squire loses
equipment through carelessness or ineptitude, the master will also supply replacements.
<P></P>
   <B>Bonded Mount:</B> Mounts of higher intelligence, such as unicorns or pegasi, are rarely drawn
to Squires, nor are unusually strong war horses, such as greater or standard
paladin mounts. Medium war horses, light war horses, and riding horses are the
most likely mounts.
<P></P>
<B>   Special Benefits:</B>
<P></P>
   <I>Punishment Buffer:</I> Technically, the master is responsible for the Squire's actions. Therefore,
if a Squire commits a crime or some other indiscretion, the master may share the
punishment or speak on the Squire's behalf to have the punishment suspended.
In game terms, the DM has the option of reducing or setting aside punishments
when the Squire commits minor ethos violations. For instance, if the Squire
accidently insults an aristocrat, the DM may let him off with a warning rather than
have him perform a penance (offstage, the master has taken the punishment for
the Squire, apologized on his behalf, or bargained for a reduced punishment).
The Squire takes full responsibility for all serious ethos violations; the master
can't—or won't—help him.
<P></P>
   <I>Economic Advantages: </I>The master not only supplies his Squire with basic equipment, he also pays him
a regular stipend, typically 5-10 gp per month. (The Squire must tithe from
this stipend as he would any other income.) The master may also be able to supply
other needed equipment for free or at a reduced cost, and loan money with
little or no interest.
<P></P>
<B>   Special Hindrances:</B>
<P></P>
<I>   No Privileged Relationships.</I> A Squire has no special access to officials, sages, and other elite
characters, unless his master paves the way.
<P></P>
   <I>Subservience:</I> A Squire can't marry, undertake a long trip, or make any other major decision
without his master's permission. The master decides where the Squire's tithes
go, how much treasure he may keep, and if a particular mission is worth the
Squire's time. If the master is dead, the Squire must pray to the master's spirit;
the master's answer will come in a dream, or as decided by the DM.
<P></P>
   The Squire may also be required to meet regularly with the master—say, at
least once a year. Failure to show up constitutes an ethos violation. If the master
is dead, the Squire must visit his grave and commune with his spirit.
<P></P>
   Additionally, a Squire must obey the orders of <I>all</I> paladins, not just his master, including those whose levels are lower than
his.
<P></P>
<I>   No Strongholds.</I> In most cultures, law and tradition prevent Squires from building strongholds
or holding real estate. The DM may make an exception for a high-level Squire
(at least 15th level) who demonstrates outstanding service (he saves the king's
life or rescues a kidnapped prince). Even then, a Squire is most likely to be a
trustee or regent.
