   All paladins have an abiding faith that serves as a moral compass and
foundation for their ethical principles. Although most follow established religions,
others draw spiritual sustenance from non-traditional philosophies and even
natural forces. All paladins, however, believe in something: Their faith provides
them with not only their spells, but also their special powers.
<P></P>
   This chapter looks at the medieval relationship between paladins and the
church, as well as some alternatives to the historical model. It also examines the
paladin's duties and responsibilities to his faith, along with the penalties
imposed for violating religious edicts.
