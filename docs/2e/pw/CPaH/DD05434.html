   Because of their sterling reputations, paladins can often get an audience with
officials of their government and church. Affluent citizens, renowned sages,
and other influential nonplayer characters in the paladin's territory also
extend this courtesy, as do elite NPCs the paladin meets on his travels. As soon as
the paladin requests to see him, the influential character usually arranges a
meeting as soon as possible. A meeting doesn't guarantee that the NPC will help
the paladin or even be sympathetic to his plight. However, the paladin can
reasonably expect a fair hearing.
<P></P>
   If the paladin is sincere and convincing, an elite NPC is inclined to respond
positively. At the DM's discretion, paladins earn a +2 bonus when encountering
good or neutral elite NPCs with whom they have an established relationship, and
a +1 bonus for good and neutral elite NPCs the paladin is meeting for the
first time. Evil NPCs, likely to be unmoved, receive no special bonuses to their
reaction rolls.
