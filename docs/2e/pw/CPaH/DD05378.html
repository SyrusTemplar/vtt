   As detailed in Chapter 3, a paladin's ethos compels him to put his life on the
line far more often than other characters. While companions may hesitate, a
paladin will fight to the last enemy, volunteer for near-suicidal missions, and
face death to defend a principle.
<P></P>
   To compensate for these risks, a paladin's faith grants increased immunity to
poisons, death magic, and similar hazards. This immunity is manifested as a
permanent +2 bonus to all saving throws. The bonuses take effect at 1st level.
Table 5 in Chapter 1 summarizes the paladin's saving throws.
<P></P>
   These bonuses do <I>not</I> apply to a paladin's ability checks. A paladin with a Strength of 16 attempts
a Strength check at 16, not 18. However, the paladin does benefit from the
saving-throw bonuses available to other characters, such as those awarded for high
Dexterity and Wisdom scores (shown on <A HREF="../PHB/DD01428.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01428.html">Tables 2</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> and <A HREF="../PHB/DD01434.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01434.html">5</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"> in the <I>PH</I>) and magical armor.
