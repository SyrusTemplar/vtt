   What Is a paladin like as a person? His statistics and special abilities
distinguish him from other characters, but are his feelings and motivations
different? What does he do with his time? Where does he get his money? And how do you
get to <I>be</I> a paladin, anyway?
<P></P>
   Because no two paladins are alike, there are no fixed answers to these
questions, just as there are no fixed rules for designing personalities. As you look
over the topics in this chapter, consider how they apply to your paladin
character. Think about where he came from and what he wants from life, what makes him
happy or miserable. Focus on the basics, and don't worry too much about
details. Remember that a paladin's personality isn't set in concrete, but will grow
and change as he responds to new experiences.
