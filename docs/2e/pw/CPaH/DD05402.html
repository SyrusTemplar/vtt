<P></P>
<B>   Description:</B> The Errant is an independent warrior who roams the countryside searching for
adventure and offering his assistance to any good beings in need. Though he
technically owes fealty to a government or church, he has few, if any, formal
obligations. His superiors have granted him an indefinite leave of absence to
pursue his own interests and make his own way.
<P></P>
   An Errant may be granted independence because his government no longer has a
need for a standing army, or because his church elders have encouraged him to
explore the world outside their jurisdiction and report what he discovers. Most
often, however, governments and churches grant independence for economic
reasons. An Errant assumes responsibility for his own equipment and funds, freeing
official treasuries for more pressing expenditures.
<P></P>
   <B>Requirements:</B> Standard.
<P></P>
   <B>Ministration: </B>Although he may have pledged fealty to a government or a church, an Errant
essentially functions as an independent fighter.
<P></P>
   <B>Role:</B> An Errant is often amiable, cooperative, and eager to ally himself with any
party or individual of lawful good intention. His destiny, he believes, is with
the gods, and he readily agrees to undertake all good missions that come his
way, providing they promise adventure and don't compromise his principles.
<P></P>
   Between adventures, an Errant is preoccupied with earning a living.
Tournaments provide the best opportunities for income. Because an Errant doesn't depend
on government or church sponsorship, he can keep his winnings for training
(aside from his tithe).
<P></P>
   When tournaments are scarce, an Errant may work as a mercenary for any lawful
good government or church. The Errant receives no benefits from this
arrangement, other than those specified in his contract. A typical contract includes the
following terms:
<P></P>
 • <I>Length of service.</I> This is often defined in quarter-year periods. Typically, an Errant serves no
less than six months, and  no more than a year. The Errant pledges temporary fealty to his employer
during this time; all obligations to the employer end when the contract expires.
<P></P>
 • <I>Salary.</I> An Errant is usually paid every quarter-year period, with the first period's
payment made in advance. He usually earns 30-50 gp per period, depending on his
experience, reputation, and special skills. Without the backing of a  government or church, an Errant commands less of a salary than other mercenary
paladins (see Chapter 8).
<P></P>
 •<I> Theater of operations.</I> An Errant is not required to fight for his employer outside of a specified
area.
<P></P>
 • <I>Financial obligations.</I> An Errant furnishes all of his own equipment and assumes responsibility for
his own food and supplies. The employer arranges transportation to and from the
battlefield if the Errant has no mount of his own. An Errant is <I>not</I> allowed to use a loaned mount in battle, unless he agrees in advance to make
restitution in case the mount is wounded or killed.
<P></P>
 • <I>Division of spoils.</I> All hostages, weapons, land, and other spoils of war claimed by the Errant
become the property of the employer. A benevolent employer may give the Errant a
monetary bonus for such spoils, though the employer is under no obligation to
do so.
<P></P>
 • <I>Loaning of services.</I> While under contract, the employer may loan the services of an Errant to
another lawful good liege, a church, or an adventuring party. The employer claims
50% of all treasure or salary obtained by the loaned Errant (because the Errant
must also tithe from this money, he forfeits a total of 60% of his income).
<P></P>
 <B>  Symbol:</B> An Errant displays the same symbol as his church or government, or he can
design a unique, personal one. Personal symbols might include his initials, a
profile of a favorite animal, or a numeral (the age a parent died, the number of
siblings in his family, or the day of his birth).
<P></P>
   <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Farmer, Fisher, Groom, Hunter, Trapper/Furrier.
<P></P>
   <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonus:</I> The Errant receives a free specialization in the jousting lance. <I>Required:</I> Sword (any).
<P></P>
<B>   Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonus:</I> Jousting*. <I>Recommended:</I> Animal Handling, Bowyer/Fletcher, Endurance, Etiquette, Fire-building,
Fishing, Hunting, Mountaineering, Riding (Airborne and Land-based), Survival.
<P></P>
   <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> At the outset of his career, an Errant receives only 25-100 (5d4¥5) gp. In
addition to his weapons, armor, and mount, an Errant must also buy a jousting
lance or a lance cup (see Chapter 6) as soon as possible.
<P></P>
<B>   Bonded Mount:</B> Any.
<P></P>
<B>   Special Benefits:</B>
<P></P>
   Usually, an Errant continues to follow the laws of his government and the
tenets of his faith. However, his superiors rarely issue any direct edicts,
allowing the Errant to choose his own allies, go where he pleases, and make his own
decisions. He seldom has to fight wars, attend state functions, or train novice
warriors.
<P></P>
   An Errant's superiors expect him to make reports of his activities once a year
or so, but this requirement is flexible. An Errant may miss his report date by
several months before his superiors consider penalizing him, and even then,
the penalty may be suspended if the Errant offers a reasonable excuse.
<P></P>
   <B>Special Hindrances:
<P></P>
</B>   Although an Errant has few of the responsibilities of fealty, neither does he
have any of the advantages. He must be totally self-supporting, supplying his
own mounts, weapons, shelter, and clothing. He can't count on his church or
government for emergency funds, nor can he ask for bodyguards or troops. For a
stronghold, he must acquire land through conquest or purchase, as grants, charters,
and benefices aren't available.
