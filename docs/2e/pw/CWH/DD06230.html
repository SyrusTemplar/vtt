 If the DM is using the optional rules for spell components (page 44 of the <I>Dungeon Master's Guide</I>), the components for the proposed spell should be established before the
research begins. If the spell is of a relatively low level, the components should
be fairly simple, but higher-level spells might require unusually obscure
components, such as the cloak of a spectre, the freshly-clipped toenail of a troll,
or a handful of dust from the Abyss. (The quest for a needed component makes for
an excellent adventure springboard.)  In any case, the wizard must have all
necessary components in hand before he can begin his research
