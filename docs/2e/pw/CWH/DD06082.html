<P></P>
  <B>Description:</B> This school includes two different types of magic, though both involve
bringing in matter from another place. Conjuration spells produce various forms of
non-living matter. Summoning spells entice or compel creatures to come to the
caster, as well as allowing the caster to channel forces from other planes. Since
the casting techniques and ability requirements are the same for both types of
magic, conjuration and summoning are considered two parts of the same school. 
<P></P>
  <B>Specialist Name:</B> Conjurer. A specialist who has learned only summoning spells sometimes calls
himself a summoner, but this is merely a matter of semantics and has no bearing
on the specialist's abilities, restrictions, or effectiveness. 
<P></P>
  <B>Allowed Races:</B> A wizard must have human blood to be a conjurer. Therefore, humans and
half-elves can specialize in this school, but elves cannnot. 
<P></P>
  <B>Ability Requirements:</B> A wizard must have exceptional stamina to spend a lifetime casting
conjuration and summoning spells, since he is at times tapping into his own life force in
order to create conjured matter or lure summoned creatures. Therefore, a
wizard must have a Constitution score of at least 15 to specialize in this school. 
<P></P>
  <B>Saving Throw Modifiers:</B> All opponents modify their saving throws by -1 when attempting to save
against a conjuration or summoning spell cast by a conjurer. A conjurer adds a +1
bonus when saving against conjuration spells or attacks from creatures or forces
created by summoning spells. 
<P></P>
  <B>Bonus Spells and Acquired Powers:</B> A conjurer can memorize an extra spell at each spell level, providing that at
least one of the memorized spells is from the school of conjuration/summoning.
When a conjurer reaches 17th level, he no longer requires any material
components to cast conjuration and summoning spells. When a conjurer reaches 20th
level, he gains the ability to instantly dispel creatures conjured by an opponent
who has used a<I> monster summoning</I> spell or its equivalent. The conjurer can dispel up to 10 Hit Dice worth of
creatures with this ability; only creatures with 5 HD or fewer are affected
(therefore, the conjurer could dispel two 5 HD creatures or ten 1 HD creatures, but
not a 6 HD creature). The conjurer can use this ability up to three times per
day by pointing at the creatures to be affected and concentrating. 
<P></P>
  <B>Oppositional Schools:</B> A conjurer cannot learn spells from the schools of greater divination and
invocation/evocation. 
<P></P>
  <B>Spell Analysis:</B> Although the conjurer doesn't have an excessive number of specialty spells
from which to choose, spells of the conjuration/summoning school are among the
most potent of all, comparable only to the school of necromancy in sheer power. 
<P></P>
  Though useful in a wide variety of situations, conjuration/summoning spells
are particularly effective in combat, since the majority of them are capable of
inflicting damage. 
<P></P>
  Generally, conjuration spells such as <I>Melf's acid arrow</I> inflict damage directly, while summoning spells, such as <I>monster summoning</I>, use an intermediary force or monster to attack opponents. Direct attacks
have the advantage of immediacy; <I>Melf's acid arrow,</I> for instance, is sent directly at its target. Indirect attacks using an
intermediary have the advantage of versatility; giant rats summoned by <I>monster summoning I</I> can be directed to attack the stationary Opponent No. 1, then can be ordered
to run down the fleeing Opponent No. 2. 
<P></P>
  Many summoning attacks require the continual participation of the conjurer; he
can't control his summoned creatures if he can't communicate with them. This
is especially crucial with spells such as<I> conjure elemental,</I> where the summoned creature will turn on the conjurer if the conjurer breaks
his concentration. 
<P></P>
  Conjurers who learn a large number of spells to summon creatures are better in
large parties; the more companions he has, the more protection he has
available if a need arises for his comrades to run interference, helping to ensure that
his concentration remains unbroken. When traveling, such conjurers should
remain in the center of the party, traditionally the safest spot. As members of
smaller parties, conjurers are more effective knowing a variety of
conjuration/summoning spells, particularly those that inflict damage directly; a conjurer with
only one or two companions may find it difficult-- and dangerous-- to cast <I>conjure elemental</I>. 
<P></P>
  <B>Most Desirable Spells:</B> 
<P></P>
  Low-Level:<I> Melf's acid arrow, summon swarm</I>, and <I>flame arrow</I> are excellent offensive spells, but <I>monster summoning I</I> is the prize -- a clever conjurer should find numerous uses for, say, eight
giant rats. 
<P></P>
  Medium-Level: The monster summoning spells are the best. <I>Conjure elemental, Mordenkainen's faithful hound</I>, and <I>summon shadow</I> can turn the tide in just about any battle with low or medium level
opponents. 
<P></P>
  High-Level: This group includes what most wizards consider to be the most
prized spell of any school, <I>wish</I>. <I>Limited wish</I> is nearly as potent. 
<P></P>
  Because DMs vary widely in how they handle wishes, players with conjurer
characters might want to discuss with their DM his parameters for adjudicating these
types of spells. (See the <A HREF="DD06210.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD06210.html">Spell Commentary</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> section in Chapter 7 for more about <I>wishes</I>.)  In addition to wishes, high-level conjuration/summoning spells offer the
conjurer some extremely powerful offensive spells. The all-around best in combat
are <I>power word, kill; prismatic sphere</I>; and the <I>monster summoning</I> spells. 
<P></P>
  <B>Ethos:</B> Because of the great power they wield, most conjurers are utterly convinced
that their specialty is superior to all others. Illusion and divination are
trivial, alteration and invocation are inconsequential, abjuration and enchantment
are too weak, and necromancy is too repulsive. Though tending toward smugness
and arrogance, conjurers are also confident, courageous, and bright. 
<P></P>
  Conjurers tend to rely on summoned creatures to perform difficult tasks for
them; hence, many conjurers grow flabby as the years pass. Many consider
conjurers to be downright lazy. 
<P></P>
  Conjurers recognize the importance of keeping evil in check, and most are of
good alignment. Evil conjurers flourish, however, particularly those who
maintain contact with evil entities summoned from other planes of existence. 
<P></P>
  Conjurers speak their minds freely and have little patience for the opinions
of those they consider to be inferior; it takes a leader of proven worth and
unyielding strength to earn the respect of a conjurer. In an adventuring party,
conjurers tend to prefer action to discussion, and attacking to negotiating.
Conjurers relish every opportunity for combat in order to demonstrate their power.  
<P></P>
  Since conjurers have little interest in associating with common people, they
prefer to live in isolated areas of the countryside. Most consider children a
nuisance, so even the few conjurers who marry typically remain childless by
choice. 
<P></P>
  Aside from magical research, conjurers shun all activities that would normally
constitute a career or occupation. When funds are low, conjurers can always
summon creatures to fetch treasure for them
