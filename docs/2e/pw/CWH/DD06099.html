  To illustrate this procedure, a new school is created here. First, one of the
categories of channelled energy is chosen. The school will involve changing one
type of item into another, so the choice is the Transformation category.
<P></P>
  Next, we define the type of Transformation effects the school will produce.
This definition needs to be as clear as possible; writing down the definition in
a sentence or two will put it on the right track. Our school will feature
spells that cause an object or condition to change into a different but related
object or condition. That description is vague, but good enough to get started. 
<P></P>
  Is this school sufficiently different from existing schools? Our school sounds
very similar to the school of alteration, so it needs some adjustments. Since
many of the alteration spells imbue a creature with special abilities, such as <I>water breathing</I> and<I> fly</I>, we can decide that the spells from our school will deal with physical
transformations only. Further, all of our physical transformations will be permanent
(subject to the usual limitations, such as cancellation by <I>dispel magic</I>).  
<P></P>
  Throughout the remainder of this chapter, we'll continue to develop this
school as a demonstration
