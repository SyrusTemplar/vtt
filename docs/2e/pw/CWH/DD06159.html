 A wizard's quest for hard-to-find components for his spells and his research
can take him to cities and villages around the world. A career as a tradesman
can be a natural outgrowth of these travels. Wizard traders are most likely to
deal in precious gems, potions, and various collector's items. A wizard may also
earn a living as a broker in spell components, dealing exclusively with other
wizards.
