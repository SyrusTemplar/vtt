  Each potential spell should be checked against the spells in the <A HREF="../PHB/DD02320.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD02320.html">Player's Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> to see if it already exists. Considering that the <I>PH</I> lists hundreds of spells, re-inventing an existing spell is easy. A DM need
not be obsessive about this; a large number of existing spells inflict damage or
add bonuses and penalties to saving throws. As long as the new spell has a
unique twist of its own, it can be deemed acceptable.

  Of our examples, we notice that <I>blood to dust</I> is superficially similar to the 7th-level <I>finger of death</I> spell, since they both instantly take a victim's life. But the methods of
achieving this effect are distinctly different; <I>blood to dust</I> changes the victim's blood to an inert substance, while <I>finger of death </I>snuffs out the victim's life force. Further, <I>blood to dust</I> is only effective on victims with blood in their veins.<I> Blood to dust</I> is different enough to stand on its own.
