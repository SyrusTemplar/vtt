  All existing schools use 4-sided dice to determine their specialists' hit
points. The power wielded by a specialist, especially in the higher levels, more
than compensates for his relatively low number of hit points. If the specialist
is too weak, consider creating more spells, adjusting the current spells to make
them stronger, or giving him access to spells from more schools
