 At the end of this book is a blank Kit Creation Sheet. Copies of this sheet
may be made to help you design new kits. The DM or players can design new kits
appropriate to the character types they would like to play. However, if a player
designs his own kit, he should check all details of the kit with his DM. The DM
may make changes, or he may disallow the kit altogether
