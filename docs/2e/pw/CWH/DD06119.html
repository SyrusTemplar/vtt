  In Chapter 1, we discussed at length the schools of magic described in the <I>Player's Handbook</I>. In Chapter 2, we explained how to design new schools. Specialization in a
school is an excellent way to individualize a wizard character, but it is not the
only way. 
<P></P>
  In this chapter, we'll show you how to further individualize a wizard
character by choosing a wizard kit. A kit is a collection of skills, proficiencies,
advantages, and disadvantages used to help define a wizard's personality and
background as well as his role in the campaign
