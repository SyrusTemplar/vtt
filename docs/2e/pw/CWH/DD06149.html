<B> Character Description:</B> The Neophyte is a young, low-level wizard: an inexperienced novice anxious to
begin his life as an adventurer and excited about the prospects ahead. 
<P></P>
 However, the Neophyte's eagerness is more than matched by his naivete. He has
seen little of the world outside of his homeland; when encountering new
cultures or experiencing new situations, he may be confused and intimidated or curious
and impulsive. Since he tends to overestimate his abilities and underestimate
dangers, he constantly gets himself into trouble. Still, his cheerful outlook
and youthful enthusiasm endear the Neophyte to his companions, and he is a
welcome member of any party, even if his friends usually have their hands full
looking after him. 
<P></P>
 Hopefully, the Neophyte will not be naive forever. With experience comes
wisdom, and with wisdom comes sophistication. As a campaign progresses, the Neophyte
should temper his impulsiveness with caution and his brashness with maturity.
Therefore, this personality type is only a temporary one-- at some point, the
character will abandon the role of the Neophyte and grow into a different
personality. The road from innocence to maturity is a fascinating one, making the
Neophyte an excellent choice for novice wizards and beginning role-players. 
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <B>Best Suited For</B>: The entire range of neutral and good alignments are open to the Neophyte.
Characters with evil alignments should be avoided-- they aren't trusting or naive
enough to make enjoyable Neophyte characters. 
<P></P>
 Since all wizards begin their careers as novices, any kit suits the Neophyte,
although the serious-minded Wu Jen and Academician are less likely to exhibit
the Neophyte's enthusiasm and impulsiveness. 
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <B>In Combat Situations:</B> The Neophyte has probably experienced little combat in his life, especially
the life-threatening variety. Although understandably nervous, he is also
determined to do his best and prove to his comrades that he is not just a child who
needs to be protected. Unfortunately, this attitude often results in
inappropriate and ineffective tactics; the Neophyte is likely to charge his opponents
head-on, regardless of their size or strength, or fire missile weapons at anything
that moves. He might seem to cast spells at random, sometimes squandering his
most powerful magic on relatively defenseless foes. As an inexperienced spell
caster, he is not familiar with sophisticated casting techniques; for instance,
when faced with a charging wolf pack, he's more likely to use <I>magic missile</I> on a single wolf instead of casting it on a nearby cliff-face to cause an
avalanche, thus destroying the entire pack. 
<P></P>
 Assuming his companions can keep him from accidentally killing himself, the
Neophyte gradually learns from experience, becoming a more skillful combatant as
he matures. Eager to learn, a Neophyte will make a good student to a more
experienced comrade. An older and wiser PC wizard might wish to take a Neophyte
under his wing to show him the ways of the world. 
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <B>In Role-Playing Situations:</B> Generally, the Neophyte does not know how to act around NPCs, particularly
those older than him. He might be shy and say nothing, or he might blurt out
something inappropriate. Figures of authority intimidate him, smooth-talkers take
advantage of him, and attractive members of the opposite sex reduce him to a
blathering, stammering idiot. 
<P></P>
 The Neophyte tends to accept people on face value; he never guesses that a
friendly stranger might be picking his pocket. Friendly, personable NPCs will find
the Neophyte charming and amusing; impatient, businesslike NPCs will find him
exasperating and annoying
