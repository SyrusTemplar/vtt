<B>Sink 
<P></P>
 </B>This spell is a terrific way to help a character who is on the verge of
falling off the edge of a cliff or losing his grip when hanging from the edge of a
building. While the subject clings to the cliff, the wizard casts <I>sink.</I> If the spell is successfully cast, the subject becomes stuck to the cliff and
won't fall. However, the spell expires in four turns, at which time the
subject risks falling.
