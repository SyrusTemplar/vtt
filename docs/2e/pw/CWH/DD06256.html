<P></P>
 As a condition of graduation in many magical academies, a new wizard is
obligated to promise to uphold the academy's principles of conduct. A sampling of
these principles are listed below. 
<P></P>
 Not all academies subscribe to all of these principles, while others might
include principles other than the ones given here. Further, these principles
primarily apply to academies who accept students of good and lawful alignments; the
principles of evil and lawless academies will probably be significantly
different from these. The DM must decide which principles apply to specific academies
and what penalties--if any--might apply to a graduate who violates them. 
<P></P>
 1. The wizard will operate discreetly. He will reveal the secrets of his
teachings to no one. 
<P></P>
 2. The wizard will operate within the laws of his country. 
<P></P>
 3. The wizard will meet all of his expenses from his own funds. He will not
accept charity. 
<P></P>
 4. The wizard will live in seclusion. He will strive to minimize his social
contact with non-wizards. 
<P></P>
 5. The wizard will minimize his contact with kings, princes, and other rulers. 
<P></P>
 6. The wizard's home will include at least one room reserved exclusively for
research and study. 
<P></P>
 7. The wizard will be patient. He will persevere in the face of adversity. 
<P></P>
 8. The wizard will not attempt to circumvent accepted magical procedures. 
<P></P>
 9. The wizard will strive to add to the existing body of magical knowledge
through original research.
