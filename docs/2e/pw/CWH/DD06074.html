  Does the wizard character have easy access to a mentor of his preferred
school? Is the mentor in ill health, is his city under siege, or is his future
otherwise in question? Although there are ways to learn spells without a mentor (or
magic academy), the wizard may want to think carefully before committing to a
specialization if he can't depend on the availability of his mentor (or academy)
for consultation and further training.
