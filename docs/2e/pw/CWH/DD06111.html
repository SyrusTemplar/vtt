<P></P>
  Not all races can become specialists of all schools. Usually, these
limitations are due to a particular race's body chemistry, mental or emotional
predisposition, magical resistance, or cultural restrictions. The history of the DM's
campaign world might also suggest limitations. 
<P></P>
  If the DM imposes racial restrictions on a new school, he should present
justification for them. For instance, gnomes are restricted from specializing in our
school of metamorphics. The reason? A thousand years ago in our campaign
world, a brotherhood of transfigurist gnomes accidently developed a metamorphics
spell that permanently transformed a city of gnomes into a field weeds. The gods
were so upset by this carelessness that the transfigurist specialty has been
forbidden to gnomes ever since.
