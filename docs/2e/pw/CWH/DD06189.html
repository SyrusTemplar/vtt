 Reconnaissance spells neither inflict damage nor provide protection, but they
serve a vital function in combat by furnishing crucial information in the
following ways:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> By revealing the presence of enemies (<I>detect evil</I>)
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> By revealing enemy motivations (<I>ESP</I>)
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> By revealing enemy actions (<I>clairvoyance</I>)
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> By revealing future events (<I>foresight</I>)
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> By revealing past events (<I>legend lore</I>)
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> By employing supernatural guidance (<I>vision</I>)
<P></P>

<P></P>
 Obviously, most Reconnaissance spells come from the school of greater
divination, but other schools have them as well, including abjuration (<I>alarm</I>), alteration (<I>comprehend languages</I> and <I>wizard eye</I>), and illusion (<I>magic mirror</I>). Following are some general situations in which a wizard will find
Reconnaissance spells particularly useful:
<P></P>
 
<P></P>
 <I>The party is entering an unknown area.</I> The more a party knows about the potential dangers of a previously unexplored
castle, jungle, or stretch of enemy-occupied terrain, the better they can cope
with whatever they meet. A quick survey of the territory by a wizard using <I>clairvoyance, detect evil, </I>or similar spells can be an effective deterrent against ambushes and other
unexpected surprises. 
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <I>The party is unsure of the enemy's motivations.</I> Not all NPCs are enemies (maybe they are hostile because they assume the PCs
are the bad guys), and not all enemies are bent on destroying the party (maybe
they are trying to get back to their leader as quickly as possible and the PCs
are in their way). A wizard using <I>ESP, know alignment,</I> or similar spells can clarify the motives of NPCs, possibly allowing the
party to avoid combat entirely. 
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <I>The party needs a lookout or a volunteer for guard duty.</I> A wizard armed with spells such as <I>clairaudience, clairvoyance, foresight,</I> and <I>wizard eye</I> makes an excellent lookout. He can also serve as a party's communications
officer in combat, keeping track of his companion's actions, tracking the actions
of the enemy, and becoming alerted to companions in need of assistance. 
<P></P>

<P></P>
 <I>The party needs a spy.</I> The wizard who knows a variety of Reconnaissance spells makes a perfect spy,
either acting by himself (in which case he should ensure that his chances of
being discovered are small, since he has no armor) or in conjunction with a
companion who can serve as his bodyguard. Unlike rogues or invisible characters, who
are also good candidates for spying missions, a wizard using <I>clairaudience, ESP,</I> and similar spells can gain a lot of information from relatively safe
distances.
