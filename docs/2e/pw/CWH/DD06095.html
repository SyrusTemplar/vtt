  The first step in designing a new school is to decide what type of magical
energy will be wielded by the specialist and how that energy will manifest itself.
The type of magic must be general enough to encompass a variety of spells and
effects, but it also must be specific enough to differentiate it from existing
schools.

  Before examining the specifics, consider the differences between the magic of
wizards and the magic of priests. Though some duplication exists-- both have
access to necromantic and summoning spells, for instance-- the way they acquire
spells is strikingly different
