  Before attempting to design new spells, first look at the existing spells for
other schools. Notice that a number of spells listed in the <I>Player's Handbook</I> belong to more than one school; <I>rainbow pattern</I>, for instance, belongs to the schools of alteration and illusion, while<I> limited wish</I> belongs to conjuration/summoning and invocation/evocation. Do any of the <I>PH</I> spells (or any of the new spells listed in Chapter 8 of this book) seem
appropriate for your new school? The alteration spells <I>transmute rock to mud</I> and<I> transmute water to dust</I> are perfect for our school of metamorphics-- they both cause one substance to
change to another, they both cause physical changes, and in both cases the
effects are permanent. 
<P></P>
  There are other likely candidates from the <I>PH </I>spells for our school, but using an excessive number of duplicate spells (more
than two or three) compromises the individuality of a new school.
