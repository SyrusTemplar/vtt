     <B>Description:</B> Amazons belong to matriarchal societies that thrive in a world otherwise
dominated by males. Women occupy all important positions in Amazon societies-- they
are the rulers, artisans, soldiers, and scholars. 
<P></P>
     Most Amazon societies have existed unchanged for thousands of years,
living in relative isolation from the rest of the word, but others have more recent
origins. Some were established by disgruntled women who tired of their
subservient roles in male-dominated cultures and decided to rule themselves, while
others were created by deities sympathetic to the plight of women. 
<P></P>
     Men are second-class citizens in Amazon cultures, occupying positions of
menial servitude to their female superiors. In some societies, men are kept as
slaves, treated only marginally better than domestic animals. Still others have
eliminated men entirely. 
<P></P>
     Amazons from totally male-free societies make occasional forays into
neighboring communities to fraternize with men. Others perpetuate their
civilization by being extremely friendly with male adventurers passing through their
territory; when the Amazons tire of their company, the adventurers are sent on their
way or killed. 
<P></P>
     An Amazon society may be as small as a single village or large enough to
fill an entire continent. Because they are continually under siege from
male-dominated civilizations, Amazons have mastered the art of war. Traditionally,
Amazons are superior horse breeders and riders, excelling with spears, bows, and
other weapons that can be wielded from horseback. 
<P></P>
     A character must be female to be an Amazon. There are no other
requirements. 
<P></P>
     To abandon this kit, the character must renounce her Amazon citizenship,
most likely because she has grown to identify more closely with a different
culture. 
<P></P>
    <B> Preferred Schools:</B> Amazons with high Constitution tend to be drawn to the schools of
conjuration/summoning and invocation/evocation; both are especially useful on the
battlefield. Diviners are also common, as they make excellent administrative advisors
and counselors. 
<P></P>
     <B>Barred Schools:</B> Amazons shun the dark forces associated with the school of necromancy.
Because of its perceived uselessness in combat, they also avoid the school of
illusion. 
<P></P>
    <B> Role:</B> Most Amazons are warriors, but the few wizards among them are held in high
regard, as is any person who has mastered a difficult art. Amazon Sorceresses
typically serve as seers, advisors, counselors, and administrators. Because of
their formidable power, Amazon Sorceresses especially invokers and conjurers-- are
always welcome on the battlefield. 
<P></P>
     In male-dominated cultures, the Amazon is regarded as a curiosity at
best. She is stared at, whispered about, and sometimes openly ridiculed.
Well-meaning women who have accepted subservience as a cultural norm may try to convince
the Amazon to change her unnatural ways, while chauvinistic men, seeing her as
a threat to their masculinity, may feel compelled to dominate her in any number
of ways. Even open-minded citizens will likely be suspicious of a female with
such unusual attitudes. 
<P></P>
     Among her peers in an adventuring party, the Amazon Sorceress will prove
to be a courageous fighter and a capable spell caster. Although the other
player-characters may harbor some prejudices of their own about the role of females,
the DM should discourage any overt discrimination; once she has proven herself
in tough situations, the Amazon should be accepted as an equal in all regards. 
<P></P>
     <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Required: Groom. 
<P></P>
     <B>Weapon Proficiency:</B> Required: None. Recommended: Spear or long bow. This is contrary to the
weapons usually allowed wizards, but is typical for Amazon cultures. 
<P></P>
     <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Bonus Proficiencies: Riding (Land-based), Animal Training. Recommended:
(General) Animal Handling; (Warrior) Animal Lore, Armorer, Bowyer/Fletcher, Hunting,
Running, Survival, Tracking. 
<P></P>
     <B>Equipment:</B> When an Amazon character is first created, she must buy her weapons from
among the following choices only: bow (any type), dagger/dirk, javelin, knife,
spear. Once she has adventured elsewhere in the world, she may purchase other types
of weapons. 
<P></P>
     <B>Special Benefits:</B> Male opponents who have never encountered the formidable Amazon women tend to
underestimate them. Therefore, the first time such a male encounters an Amazon
in combat, the Amazon receives a +3 bonus to hit and +3 to damage on her first
blow only. These bonuses reflect the fact that the opponent is taken off guard
by such an able female. 
<P></P>
     This bonus is not applicable in every situation. The DM should consider
the following guidelines when ruling on the Amazon Sorceress's bonus. 
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The bonus does not apply to opponents of 5th level or higher. Such opponents
are too seasoned to be surprised in this manner. 
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The bonus does not apply to opponents from cultures where females are accepted
as equals and female warriors are common. 
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The bonus does not apply to opponents who have fighting females as comrades,
who have faced fighting women before, or who have seen the Amazon use her bonus
on someone else. 
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The bonus does not always apply to player characters. The DM might ask a
quick, guarded question of the player to learn whether his character would
underestimate a female opponent.
<P></P>
     
<P></P>
     Regardless of whether the Amazon's first blow hits or misses her intended
victim, the victim will never be subject to the bonus again; the bonus can be
used only once per victim. 
<P></P>
     <B>Special Hindrances:</B> The Amazon suffers a -3 reaction roll adjustment from NPCs from male-
dominated societies. This reaction adjustment no longer applies once characters come
to know and respect her. Likewise, player characters need not respond with
hostility toward their Amazon companion unless they want to do so for role-playing
purposes. 
<P></P>
     <B>Wealth Options:</B> The Amazon Sorceress receives the normal (1d4 + 1) x 10 gp as starting money. 
<P></P>
    <B> Races:</B> Most Amazons are human, but other races are acceptable, with the adjustments
that follow. 
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Half-elves: Substitute either short bow or spear for the required Weapon
Proficiency. 
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Gnomes: Substitute throwing axe or short sword for the required Weapon
Proficiency, use ponies for mounts, and substitute Tracking and Survival for the bonus
Nonweapon Proficiencies. 
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Elves: Substitute Endurance and Set Snares for the bonus Nonweapon
Proficiencies.
