 The DM is encouraged to modify the kits to more accurately represent the
history, cultures, and events of his campaign world. 
<P></P>
 However, he should not violate the nature of the kit; males should not be
allowed to be members of the Amazon kit, nor should Patricians be allowed to be
necromancers. Common sense must prevail. However, if there are no oriental or
eastern-styled cultures in his world, the DM is free to disallow the Wu Jen kit.
Similarly, if a natural disaster wiped out all traces of Amazon society in his
world, he can disallow the Amazon kit
