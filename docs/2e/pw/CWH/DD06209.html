 There are no spells higher than 9th-level, and there never should be.
Including higher-level spells would not only greatly imbalance the game, it would also
give characters access to magic reserved exclusively for gods. 
<P></P>
 DMs contemplating the idea of designing 10th-level or higher spells in spite
of this advice should first consider the implications of <I>wish</I>, generally considered to be the most powerful of all the spells. To be worthy
of its superior ranking, any 10th-level spell would have to be significantly
stronger than a <I>wish</I>, and if the game is to retain its integrity, that's a mighty tall order. 
<P></P>
 In a high-level campaign, the DM might decide that his characters do not have
access to an adequate number of high-level spells. Rather than fuss with
10th-level spells, the DM is encouraged to add to the list of 9th-level spells (see
