  The most important part of creating a new school is designing new spells that
are different enough to set it apart from existing schools. There must be
enough new spells to provide the user a reasonable variety of options. At the same
time, duplication of existing spells should be avoided. Minor variations of
existing spells should also be avoided. The spell selection should be attractive
enough so that novice wizards will consider specializing in it, but not so
powerful that the school overwhelms all others
