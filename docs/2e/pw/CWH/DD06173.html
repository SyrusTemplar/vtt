 An elderly wizard might grow weary of his sedentary existence and welcome any
opportunity to add some excitement to his life. Such a wizard would eagerly
join any party of player characters if the party's mission promised to be exciting
and didn't violate the wizard's personal values (a PC wizard of good alignment
is unlikely to join an evil party about to embark on a murder spree unless he
is pretending to be evil in order to stop them). 
<P></P>
 Since a party can always use an extra wizard, a group of player characters
might coax an old PC wizard out of retirement to help them on a mission. The PC
wizard might be enticed by a monetary reward, the lure of adventure, or the
possibility of settling an old debt (perhaps the party believes they will be facing
an old nemesis of the PC wizard). The PC wizard also might agree to help them
out of a sense of loyalty to his former companions
