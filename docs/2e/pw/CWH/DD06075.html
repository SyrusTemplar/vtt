  If the character's party already includes one or more mages, the wizard might
choose a specialization to give the party a wider variety of character types.
If the party is small, it might be less risky to become a mage so that the
character has access to spells of all the schools. Are there other player-character
wizards with spell books they'd be willing to share? Would a specialist or a
mage have a better chance of learning those spells? (If one PC wizard is a
conjurer, his spell book probably won't be useful to a PC wizard who wants to be a
diviner.)
