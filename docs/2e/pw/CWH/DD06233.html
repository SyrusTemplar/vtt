</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> After the Basic Investment is made (or avoided, if the wizard already owns or
has access to a suitable library), the wizard must spend preparation time
before the actual research begins. This initial preparation involves basic reading
and reviewing of notes; in addition, the wizard must prepare himself mentally
and physically for the grueling task ahead. This initial preparation lasts a
number of weeks equal to the level of the proposed spell, plus one. Therefore, a
wizard attempting to research a 5th-level spell must spend six weeks in initial
preparation
