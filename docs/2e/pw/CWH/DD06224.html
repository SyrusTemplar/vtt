 As explained on page 84 of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>, if one subject successfully disbelieves an illusion and informs another
subject of the illusion, the second subject receives a modifier to his saving
throw. The amount of this modifier depends on the reliability of the informant and
the magnitude of the illusion. If the informant in unreliable and the illusion
is formidable (for instance, an illusion of a deadly monster), the subject might
ignore the informant entirely; in this case, no special saving throw modifier
applies. If the informant is reliable (the subject's commander or friend), and
the illusion is relatively minor (such as the image of a small fire), the
subject's saving throw can be modified by as much as +4
