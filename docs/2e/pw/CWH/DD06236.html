<P></P>
 In addition to researching new spells, a wizard can research existing spells
(those listed in the <I>Player's Handbook</I> and--if the DM allows them--the new spells from Chapter 8 of this book).
Since it makes sense that information about existing spells is easier to find than
information about spells that do not yet exist, it is easier for a wizard to
research them. 
<P></P>
 To account for this difference, make the following adjustments in the above
procedures when a wizard is researching an existing spell: 
<P></P>
 1. The Operational Cost is reduced to 100-600 (1d6 x 100) gp per week. 
<P></P>
2. The base chance of success is increased from 10 percent to 30 percent. 
<P></P>
 The lab costs, library costs, preparation time, and minimum number of weeks
for researching existing spells are the same as research of new spells. The cost
of increasing the base chance is also the same (2,000 gp per 10 percent
increase), as is the total amount that can be spent (8,000 gp). Notice, however, that
spending the 8,000 gp maximum increases the base chance to 70 percent (20
points higher than the 50 percent limit when researching new spells.)
