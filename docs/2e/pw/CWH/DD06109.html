  All spells must state their casting times. A guideline is to make the casting
time equal to the level of the spell (a 7th-level spell has a casting time of
7), but casting times of one or more rounds are also common. Complex spells
might have casting times of one or more turns. Avoid short casting times for
high-level spells and excessively long casting times for all but the most powerful
spells.  
<P></P>
  We'll give our 1st-level evaporation spell a casting time of 1 and our
7th-level <I>blood to dust</I> a casting time of 1 round
