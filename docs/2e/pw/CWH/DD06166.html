 Many wizards with a flair for research and laboratory technique become
successful alchemists. Most of their work is non-magical in nature, creating
fertilizers, perfumes, cough medicines, tooth powders, and food coloring for modest
fees. Magical potions, while requiring more skill and effort, are also sold,
although few commoners can afford such expensive creations.
