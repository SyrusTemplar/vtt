  Priests are granted the use of spells by deities of specific mythoi. Each
deity has authority over particular groups of concepts, forces, and things, and
these groups are called spheres. A priest's allegiance to his deity gives him
access to certain spheres of magic that reflect the deity's special interests.
Consequently, the magic of each sphere tends to be quite specific; spells from the
sun sphere, for instance, deal primarily with light and darkness, while spells
from the healing sphere deal primarily with curing. 
<P></P>
  Unlike the priest, a wizard isn't bound to a particular deity, and therefore
does not depend on a deity for his magical abilities. A wizard learns and
masters his spells in much the same way that a professor learns and masters a
particular science. This is why the wizard class is a function of Intelligence.
Wizardly schools focus on general categories of magical energy and effects and
encompass a wide variety of spells. 
<P></P>
  To preserve the integrity of these differences between wizard magic and priest
magic, any new wizard school should avoid focusing on magical effects stemming
from one particular condition or thing. Instead, the school should be
concerned with the manipulation of general energies and forces
