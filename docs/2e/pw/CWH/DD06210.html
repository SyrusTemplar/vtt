 Part of the fun of playing a wizard is developing new applications for spells
through experimentation and improvisation. However, the creative use of many
spells may not be immediately obvious. If a wizard always uses his spells in the
same old ways, he is not taking full advantage of them. 
<P></P>
 The following list features some unusual applications for a variety of spells
from all levels. Players can also use these suggestions for inspiration when
inventing new uses for other spells in their arsenals. Additionally,
clarifications of several of the game's more esoteric spells are provided, which can be
used by the DM to help adjudicate their effects
