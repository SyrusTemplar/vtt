   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>The Outer Planes</B></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">From the wizard's perspective, the key features of the 
   outer planes include the following:</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Spells that require 
   access to powers and creatures in the inner planes and Prime Material 
   planes do not function (unless otherwise noted below).</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Cantrips will not function.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Creatures and 
   phenomena native to the outer planes are unaffected by Prime Material 
   planar spells that summon, communicate, control, or prevent entry. 
   Comparable spells exist for each plane, but they must be learned by 
   the wizard in that plane; <I>animal growth</I> for animals of Elysium 
   is an example. These are not considered modifications of existing 
   spells, but different spells altogether.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">The schools of magic are affected as follows:</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Abjuration:</B> These spells are useless against 
   beings native to the plane the wizard is in (for instance,<I> 
   protection from evil</I> has no effect on the evil occupants of the 
   Nine Hells). However, <I>dispel magic</I> disrupts spells cast by 
   creatures native to the outer planes.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Alteration:</B> The Chaos planes (Happy Hunting 
   Grounds to Tarterus, inclusive) have a random effect on alteration 
   spells that create matter (such as <I>fog cloud</I>) or change matter 
   into other shapes (the various <I>polymorph</I> spells). The chance 
   of a random effect depends on the plane (see Table 10).</FONT></P>

   </TABLE></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Conjuration/Summoning:</B> Non-native beings cannot 
   be summoned unless they are in adjacent planes or planar layers. 
   Creatures native to the plane can be called upon, but they are not 
   controlled by the wizard; any tasks given such creatures must be 
   negotiated. Protective spells that are effective in the Prime 
   Material plane do not function against native creatures.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><I>Find familiar</I> will bring an imp, quasit, 
   brownie, or pseudo-dragon. The DM is free to add other suitable 
   candidates or to modify the appearance (but not the abilities) of 
   these familiars.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Enchantment/Charm:</B> Spells directed toward 
   specific creatures (such as <I>charm person</I>) will not function 
   against their outer planar equivalents. Planes other than the one 
   occupied by the wizard cannot be accessed, though extradimensional 
   space can be (so spells such as <I>deeppockets</I> function normally, 
   but spells such as <I>shadow walk</I> will not). <I>Magic jar</I> or 
   any similar spell that leaves the caster's original body unoccupied 
   creates the risk of that body being occupied by a native of the other 
   planes (see the Necromancy entry below for details).</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Divination:</B> Spells that detect or identify 
   mainly respond to the alignment of the plane, overwhelming the 
   alignment of any beings in the plane. For instance, if a good warrior 
   is in the Nine Hells, <I>know alignment</I> is overwhelmed by the 
   plane's evil nature and will not reveal that the warrior is good. 
   However, a detect good will reveal the warrior's goodness.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Illusion/Phantasm:</B> These spells function 
   normally, though the caster should keep in mind that many of the 
   powerful beings inhabiting these planes are immune to illusionary 
   attacks and effects. However, spells that rely on <I>demi-shadow magic</I> 
   and <I>shadow magic</I> function at half strength and half effects. <I>Shadow
    monsters</I>, for instance, creates creatures with half the standard 
   hit points that inflict half the standard damage when attacking; 
   shadow magic inflicts only half damage and effects.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Invocation/Evocation:</B> These function normally, 
   although they may be changed due to prevailing conditions in a 
   particular plane. Generally, these changes are similar to those 
   experienced in the inner planes. For instance, a <I>wall of ice</I> 
   will begin to melt immediately in the heat of the Nine Hells.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Necromancy:</B> These spells have no effect on the 
   natives of the planes. <I>Reincarnation</I> causes revived 
   individuals to be of the same alignment as the plane; for instance, a 
   PC reincarnated in the Nine Hells will be evil. Spells that involve a 
   body uninhabited by a spirit, such as magic jar, have a 1 percent 
   chance per day per depth of layer of being inhabited by native 
   spirits. For instance, a character who died on the eighth layer of 
   the Nine Hells has an 8 percent chance per day of his body being 
   occupied unless it is raised, while a body on the 100th level of the 
   Abyss has a 100 percent chance of being occupied on the first day). 
   The spirits will not voluntarily release the body (a<I> limited wish</I> 
   or spells of similar power will dispel them).</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Magical Items:</B> Weapons are reduced by one plus 
   for each plane they are taken through; this applies only when moving 
   from plane to plane, not when moving through planar layers. If a 
   weapon becomes non-magical, all special abilities are lost. These 
   penalties do not apply to weapons designed to affect particular 
   creatures of the outer planes. Armor and other protective devices are 
   similarly affected. All other magical items suffer the same 
   limitations as the spells they mimic. Magical items that reach into 
   extradimensional space function normally, but those that draw power 
   from the inner planes or access the Ethereal planes do not function.</FONT></P>
