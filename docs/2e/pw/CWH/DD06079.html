<P></P>
  Following are details about specialists for each school of magic. Each
includes the following information: 
<P></P>
  <B>Description:</B> This section explains the general effects created by spells from the school,
along with how the magical energy is channelled. 
<P></P>
  <B>Specialist Name:</B> The common name for a specialist of this school. 
<P></P>
  <B>Allowed Races:</B> Only humans, gnomes, elves, and half-elves can be specialists, and not all
races are able to specialize in every school. This entry indicates which races
are eligible to specialize in a particular school. 
<P></P>
  <B>Ability Requirements:</B> Though all schools require a minimum Intelligence of 9, each has an
additional minimum requirement in another ability and is listed here. 
<P></P>
  <B>Saving Throw Modifiers:</B> Because of their familiarity with the arcane arts, specialists are able to
resist the effects of certain forms of magic. Additionally, their opponents are
less able to resist certain spells cast by specialists rather than
non-specialists. These are listed here. 
<P></P>
  <B>Bonus Spells and Acquired Powers:</B> These are the special abilities and extra spells that specialists
automatically receive when they reach high levels. (The use of acquired powers is an
option only; at the DM's discretion, he can eliminate them from his campaign, or
even develop others for high-level specialists. ) 
<P></P>
  <B>Oppositional Schools:</B> The specialist is unable to learn spells from these schools. He is also
forbidden to use magical items that duplicate the effects of schools in opposition
to his own school. 
<P></P>
  <B>Spell Analysis:</B> This section discusses the spells available to the school, including their
general types and their overall usefulness to the wizard. For convenience, spells
are divided into three categories: Low (1st-3rd level), Medium (4th-6th
level), and High (7th-9th level). The most versatile and powerful spells are
designated as the &quot;Most Desirable&quot; for each of these categories. 
<P></P>
  <B>Ethos: </B>This section details the wizard's relationship to society, his goals and
values, his overall philosophy, how he spends his time, and his likely role in an
adventuring party. Since certain types of people tend to veer toward the same
fields of study, some personality descriptions common to specialists of the school
are also included. 
<P></P>
  Note that these are general guidelines only, and any number of exceptions are
possible, but they can be used to help the player shape his character's
personality or help him decide which school seems most appropriate for the character
he has in mind
