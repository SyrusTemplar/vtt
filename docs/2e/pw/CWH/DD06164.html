 Experienced wizards sometimes record their research procedures, tips for
successful spellcasting, or techniques for magical item creation in detailed
manuscripts. Depending on the reputation of the wizard, such tomes can command hefty
sums. Rarely are more than a few copies of any such manuscript produced, but
each copy may fetch thousands of gold pieces for the author. Some wizards also
have made names for themselves as authors of history, mathematics, and philosophy
texts.
