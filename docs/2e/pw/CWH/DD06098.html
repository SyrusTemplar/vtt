  To begin the design of a new school, the DM must first define the type of
effects it produces. Any definition is likely to be vague. But at this stage, it
should be. Unlike the intentionally specific priestly sphere, a wizardly school
must be general enough to accommodate a large variety of spells.  
<P></P>
  Use the steps that follow. 
<P></P>
  1. Choose one type of channelled magical energy from the four categories
described above: Transformation, Creation, Requisitioning, or Paranaturalism. If you
know what type of school you plan to design, the choice of category probably
will be obvious. If you do not yet have any ideas about your school, pick any of
the categories-- it's a good place to start. (If your choice of categories
seems less appropriate as your school develops, you can always pick another.)
<P></P>
  2. Define what specific type of effects these channelled energies will
produce. If it is a Transformation school, what types of things or conditions will be
transformed? If it is a Paranaturalism school, what type of paranatural
energies or forces will be involved.
<P></P>
  3. Ensure that the definition of the new school does not resemble the
definitions of existing schools too closely. Compare them with the school descriptions
in Chapter 1.
