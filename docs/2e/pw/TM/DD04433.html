<TITLE>Curdled Death-- Aromatic Oil (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B>Curdled Death:</B> Perhaps the most powerful of all aromatic oils, the smell of <I>curdled death</I> has the ability to slay all living creatures of 3 or fewer Hit Dice or
experience levels who come within 5' of the wearer. Magical, undead, and extraplanar
creatures are immune to this oil, as are all creatures of 4 or more Hit Dice or
experience levels.
<P></P>
 Upon smelling the oil, potential victims are allowed a saving throw vs. spell.
If successful, a creature suffers no effect and may remain near the wearer
without need of further saving throws. Those who fail the save drop dead in their
tracks.
<P></P>
 When a dose is worn, it remains potent enough to kill creatures for 1d3
rounds. After this time, the fragrance evaporates and another dose must be applied if
the wearer wishes to renew the effect.
