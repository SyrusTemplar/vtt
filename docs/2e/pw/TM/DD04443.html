</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B>Powder of Magic Detection</B>: Under close inspection, this ordinary-looking powder can be seen  for what
it truly is--an extremely fine powder of minute, crystalline granules. When this
powder contacts a magical object, the crystals spark and flash with a rainbow
of colors. This effect does not reveal the nature or intensity of the
enchantment--only that the item is magical.
<P></P>
 A small pinch of powder is needed for each use, no matter how large or small
the object. Each packet contains 1d10+10 pinches. Powder that is placed on a
nonmagical item yields no effect and cannot be reused.
