<TITLE>Liquid Road-- Miscellaneous Magic (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B>iquid Road:</B> When sprinkled on water, swampland, quicksand, or a similar surface, <I>liquid road</I> causes the terrain to harden to the density of granite, enabling easy
passage. Liquid road is also effective in negating the effects of spells such as <I>transmute rock to mud</I>. The <I>liquid road</I> stays hard for one hour, after which the terrain returns to its original
state. One <I>flask of liquid</I> road can harden a 5'x 5' surface (for example, a path 25' long and 1' wide).
