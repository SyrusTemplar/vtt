spells by 30%, 2nd-level spells by 20%, and 3rd-and 4th-level spells by 10%.
Fractions of one-half and greater are rounded up; all others are rounded down.

 The amulet affects only range and does not alter a spell's area of effect. The
amulet cannot affect spells with ranges of 0 or touch.

 A maximum of 1d10+4 spell levels can be affected by the amulet each day. Each
amulet has its own individual limit, secretly determined when it is found.
