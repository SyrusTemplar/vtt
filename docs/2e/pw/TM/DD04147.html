  Quest spells are not granted without a price. A priest receiving a quest spell
is unable to memorize spells of the highest level which he is allowed. He
loses any memorized spells of that level (e.g., a 13th-level cleric is unable to
use 6th-level spells). 
<P></P>
 Once a cleric has been granted a quest spell, he does not gain the ability to
automatically cast it again. Each time a priest wishes to use a quest spell, he
must repeat the described procedures.
