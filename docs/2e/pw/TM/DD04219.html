 When this spell is cast, the subject's hands widen and his fingernails thicken
and grow, becoming equivalent in size and power to the iron-like claws of an
umber hulk. The transformation takes one full round and is excruciatingly
painful, requiring a system shock roll. A failed roll causes the subject to suffer
3d4 points of damage.
<P></P>
 The subject can burrow as an umber hulk, cutting through 10 feet of solid
stone or 60 feet of soil per turn. The only limitation to this is the subject's
stamina; at the end of each turn of burrowing, the subject must succeed a
Constitution check or be forced to rest for one turn.
<P></P>
 Burrowing through soil does not necessarily create a passable tunnel. If the
subject wishes to make a passage in which others can travel or that he can exit
when the spell ends, he must dig at a rate of 30 feet per turn. Cutting a
tunnel through solid rock does not require extra care or time.
<P></P>
 The recipient of this spell can make two claw attacks per round, each
inflicting 2d6 points of damage plus any Strength bonuses. Each attack is made with a
-2 penalty to hit. This penalty applies until the subject has made two
successful consecutive attacks (not necessarily in the same round), at which time he is
accustomed to using the claws. The penalty is dropped for the remainder of the
spell.
<P></P>
 The material component is an umber hulk's claw.
