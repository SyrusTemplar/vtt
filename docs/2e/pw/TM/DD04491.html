<TITLE>Lorloveim's Obsidian Mortar and Pestle-- Miscellaneous Magic (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B>Lorloveim's Obsidian Mortar and Pestle:</B> This magical tool allows the wielder to grind even the hardest materials into
a fine powder. Rocks, metals, and even gemstones of all types may be ground to
dust in as little as 1d4 rounds.
<P></P>
 Magical items pounded beneath the pestle are allowed a saving throw vs.
disintegration. If the save is successful, the enchanted item cannot be destroyed in
this fashion. If the saving throw fails, the item is reduced to nonmagical
powder.
<P></P>
 The obsidian mortar is commonly used by wizards in the preparation of spell
components and ingredients for magical items. Neither the mortar nor the pestle
is effective without the other.
