 Magical powders are usually stored in small paper packets, cloth pouches, or
hollow blow tubes made of glass, wood, metal, or bone. A packet or pouch can be
shaken out to cover the area all around the user to a radius of 5 feet. This
action lasts an entire round. Note that powders used in this manner can affect
the user.
<P></P>
 Alternatively, powder in a tube can be blown outward in a ten-foot-long cone
shape that is one foot wide at the apex and five feet wide at the end. Used in
this manner, the powder has no chance of affecting the user (unless it rebounds
on him due to wind or similar circumstances).
<P></P>
 Powders may also be blown from the user's hand, but can only affect a single
individual within five feet of the user.
