 This spell is one of the few cooperative spells that requires one priest to
cast the transfer spell, but another priest to use its effect. On one round, a
priest (or priests) casts the mystic transfer. The spell is then active for the
remaining nine rounds of the turn.
<P></P>
 <I>Mystic transfer</I> allows a priest to receive spells from another priest of the same ethos. Any
priest of the same religion can cast a spell and transfer it to a second priest
within that spell's maximum range. The spell does not take effect; instead, it
is channelled through the <I>mystic transfer</I> into the receiving priest. This priest must immediately cast the spell or
pass it to another priest cloaked in a <I>mystic transfer</I> within the spell's range. Any number of transfers can be made in the same
round, provided each new recipient is within spell range of the previous
recipient. If the spell is not transferred, the spell takes effect.
<P></P>
 For example, a 3rd-level priest casts a <I>mystic transfer</I>. On the following round, a 10th-level priest &quot;passes&quot; a <I>flame strike</I> to the 3rd-level priest. The two priests could be 60 yards apart (the maximum
range of the <I>flame strike</I>). The 3rd-level priest could then use the <I>flame strike</I> to attack any target within 60 yards, or could pass the spell on to another
priest who has an active <I>mystic transfer</I>.
<P></P>
 The spell passed by the <I>mystic transfer</I> has the range, area of effect, damage, and other effects equal to the level
of the original caster. In the example above, the flame strike would function as
if cast by a 10th-level priest.
<P></P>
 The <I>mystic transfer</I> does not require concentration. However, on any round in which a priest is
receiving and/or transferring a spell, the caster cannot take any other
significant action.
<P></P>
 A priest can receive spells only from priests who worship the same deity and
who specifically target spells to him. Area effect spells may be passed. A
priest can never use <I>mystic transfer</I> to pluck an opponent's spells out of the air.
