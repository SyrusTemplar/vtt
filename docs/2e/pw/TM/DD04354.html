<P></P>
 This cooperative spell requires only one priest to cast it, but can be cast
only on another priest of the same faith. The recipient of the spell must
voluntarily surrender himself to the spell. The recipient becomes a host for the
caster. While the recipient does not lose his own persona or ability to act, the
host can be dominated by the caster at any time. For the most part, this
domination is complete.
<P></P>
 For the duration of the spell, the caster is essentially detached from his own
body. He can neither move nor act on his own. His mind is connected to the
host's. He sees, hears, smells, tastes, and otherwise senses everything the host
does. He can telepathically communicate with the host. Once the spell is
completed, there is no limit to the range over which it can function. However, both
the caster and host must remain on the same plane. Since the spell relies on
telepathic communication, thin lead sheeting will effectively block the connection.
<P></P>
 When desired, the caster can dominate the host. When this happens, the host's
own mind is pushed to the background and the caster's personality dominates.
The host's personality, memories, proficiencies, and spells are temporarily
replaced by those of the caster. While occupying the host, the caster can cast any
spell he himself has memorized, provided that the necessary components are on
hand. These spells function exactly as if the priest had cast them from his own
body.
<P></P>
 The caster can return control to the host at any time, restoring the
character's abilities and personality without harm.
<P></P>
 The spell is not without limitations and risks. The domination must be
voluntary. If the host resists the casting of the spell, it automatically fails. Once
the spell is in effect, the host can attempt to resist the domination. He is
then allowed a saving throw. If successful, the spell immediately ends.
<P></P>
 Whenever the host suffers damage, the caster must make a saving throw vs.
death to maintain the spell. If the save is failed, a wave of pain is transmitted
to the priest, causing 1d6 points of damage and canceling the spell. If the host
should die, the caster must make a system shock roll with the risk of
suffering instant death.
<P></P>
 The material component is a chalice worth no less than 1,000 gp. This chalice
must be given as a gift to the host (who cannot return it to the donor for any
reason).
