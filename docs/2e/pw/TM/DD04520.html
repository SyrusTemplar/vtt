and equations relating to several of the spells belonging to the sphere of
Numbers. It can be used as the material component for the spells<I> personal reading, telethaumaturgy,</I> and <I>addition</I>. If it is used in this manner, the casting time for the spell is halved, and
any saving throw that the subject of the spell might be entitled to suffers a
-2 penalty.
