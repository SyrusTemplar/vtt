 When a priest casts the 7th-level <I>astral spell</I>, he leaves his physical body in suspended animation while his astral body
travels. By touching the comatose body and casting <I>speak with astral traveler</I>, a priest can mentally communicate with the projected individual. Although
communication is mental, it takes the same amount of time as a normal, verbal
dialogue. The spell ends abruptly when its duration expires.
