</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B>Everbountiful Soup Kettle:</B> When this two-gallon metal kettle is filled with water, the liquid is
transformed into steaming, nutritious vegetable soup. One full kettle is sufficient to
provide a single meal for up to six normal appetites. No ingredients are
required for the soup, nor is heat necessary. Any nonmagical, nonpoisonous liquid
can be used in place of water. The <I>everbountiful soup kettle</I> can be used once per day.
