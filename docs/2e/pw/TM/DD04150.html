 The core of faith magic is devotional power. This power comes from the
dedication of ardent followers and priests. It is not something that can be
manipulated directly (like a spell), although it is the source of power for spells.
Unlike magical energy, devotional energy is not tied to a particular character
class. Ordinary people are as much a source of this power as are adventurers. Only
priests are significantly different, their lifelong dedication to their god
being the wellspring for even greater power.
<P></P>
 Not everyone is a source of devotional energy. Almost every character
generates a small amount of power, but only those persons dedicated in their beliefs
provide the amounts needed for faith magic. Even at this level, the total energy
provided by each person is very small. Thus, faith magic can be used only when
large numbers of sincere worshipers gather, such as particularly devout
congregations, monasteries, seminaries, and universities operated by a religious
order. Sincere belief is the most important factor. While persons attending a
service may be numerous, casual followers do not contribute to the effect.
<P></P>
 Before its power can be harnessed, the devotional energy of a group must be
gathered and concentrated toward a single effect. This is known as focusing the
effect. Once focused, the devotional energy provides power needed to maintain a
spell effect, increase its area of effect, or create a number of other
different results. A focus is created by means of the spell <I>focus</I>.
<P></P>
 Once the devotional energy has been focused, the cleric or clerics can cast
the spell to be amplified. Using the devotional energy gathered by the <I>focus</I>, the spell's effect is increased in area of effect and duration. The exact
increase depends on the level of the priest who casts the <I>focus</I>. Such amplified spells typically affect a building (such as a church or
hospital), group of buildings, or even an estate. 
<P></P>
 The spell remains in effect as long as the <I>focus</I> exists. This requires a minimum number of worshipers and periodic renewals of
the spell. Since the duration of a <I>focus</I> is long, these renewals often coincide with important festivals of the
religion, when numerous worshipers are present to provide devotional energy.
