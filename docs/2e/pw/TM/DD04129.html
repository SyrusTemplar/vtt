 Of all the new material in this book, magical items require the least effort
to introduce. Many are simply treasures that can be discovered in a newly-won
hoard. In this case, DMs are encouraged not to reveal all the powers of a
newly-found item. Rather, the player should be forced to puzzle out an item's powers.
For example, the characters find a magical quill. What does it do? How is it
used? Answering these questions is a goal that players can set for their
characters. After spending time, spells, and money on research and possibly more
adventures, the characters may discover that they own a <I>quill of law</I>.

 Another effective and logical method for introducing never-before-seen magical
items is for NPCs to possess these fascinating new devices. Thus, a wild mage
might own a <I>rod of disruption</I> or an elementalist a <I>wand of corridors</I>.
