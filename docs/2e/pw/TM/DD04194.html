 Dilation I</I> allows a wizard to increase the area of effect of any one spell of levels
1-3. The area of effect is increased by 25%; thus, a <I>stinking cloud</I> would fill a 25-foot cube, while a slow spell would affect creatures in a
50-foot cube. Fractions of feet or yards (as appropriate to the spell) are dropped.
<P></P>
 <I>Dilation I</I> must be cast immediately prior to the spell to be dilated; if a complete
round or more elapses, the dilation is wasted. The dilation spell affects only
spells which have areas of effect defined in feet or yards (numbers of creatures
cannot be increased). The dilation affects only spells cast by the same wizard.
