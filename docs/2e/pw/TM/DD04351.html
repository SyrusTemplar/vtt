 Grounding</I> offers protection against normal and magical electrical attacks within the
area of effect. The protected area and creatures within it suffer no damage from
normal electrical attacks (such as those caused by lightning bolts in a
thunderstorm and nonmagical creatures such as electric eels). Magical electrical
attacks (including lightning bolt breath weapons) cause only 50% of their normal
damage. Additionally, creatures within the area of effect receive a +2 bonus to
saving throws made against electrical attacks, regardless of whether the attacks
originate inside or outside the warded area.

 The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a coil of silver
wire.
