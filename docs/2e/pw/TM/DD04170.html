 Patternweave</I> allows the caster to make sense of apparent chaos. The caster can see such
things as pottery shards reformed into a whole pot, shreds of paper formed into a
page, scattered parts as a working machine, or specific trails appearing out
of overlapping footprints.
<P></P>
 After casting the spell, the mage studies seemingly random elements--broken
bits of glass, shreds of paper, intermingled trails, etc. The items to be studied
must be tangible--coded flashing lights, garbled speech, or thoughts of any
kind cannot be studied.
<P></P>
 The wizard must study the random elements for one round, after which the DM
secretly makes a saving throw vs. spell for the wizard. If the saving throw is
failed, the spell fails. However, if the saving throw is successful, the caster
sees in his mind the pattern these objects form. If the items studied are truly
random, no information is gained.
<P></P>
 After the caster has visualized the pattern, he can attempt to reassemble the
parts into their original form. This requires another saving throw vs. spell to
determine whether the mage remembers sufficient details to accomplish the
task. The amount of time required and the quality of restoration vary according to
the complexity of the pattern. Reassembling a shredded map may be easy;
reassembling a broken clock is significantly more difficult; rebuilding a shattered
mosaic is extremely difficult. In any case, the wizard can make only a reasonable
copy of the item. He can use this spell to restore works of art, but they will
be worth only a small percentage of their original value.
<P></P>
 The material component is a small hand lens through which the caster studies
the objects. The lens is not consumed in the casting.
