 This spell must be cast on stony ground, such as a manmade stone floor, a
natural cavern floor, or a boulder-strewn field. It is not possible to cast the
spell on a stone wall or ceiling. The spell causes an arm made of stone (about the
same size as a normal human limb) to rise from the ground beneath any creature
targeted by the caster. The stony hand attempts to grasp the leg of the
targeted creature, who is allowed a saving throw to avoid the effect; if the save is
successful, the hand disappears. Each round thereafter, the hand has a 5%
chance per level of the caster of reappearing and attacking.
<P></P>
 Creatures grasped by the hand suffer a movement rate of 0, AC penalty of -2,
and attack penalty of -2. Grasped characters lose any Dexterity bonuses. The
hand causes no damage to its victim.
<P></P>
 The stony limb has AC 2 and hit points equal to triple the caster's maximum
hit points. The maximum number of hit points a stony hand may have is 60.
<P></P>
 The material component is a miniature hand sculpted from stone, which crumbles
to dust when the conjured hand is destroyed or the spell expires.
