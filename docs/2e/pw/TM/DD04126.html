 The <I>Tome of Magic</I> is written with both the DM and player in mind. Dungeon Masters who keep this
book out the hands of their players are doing their game a disservice.
Likewise, players who want this book only to learn about the new magical items are
missing the point. Both player and DM can use this book to improve and expand the
game.
