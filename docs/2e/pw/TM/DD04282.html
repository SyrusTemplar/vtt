 This spell allows the subject unit to make an immediate rally check. It allows
the check during the Magic Phase, rather than forcing the unit to wait for the
Rally Phase in the BATTLESYSTEM™ rules. If the priest casting the spell is of
12th level or higher, the subject unit receives a +1 bonus to its rally check
die roll. The priest must have an uninterrupted line of sight to the unit. 
<P></P>
 The material component is a miniature duplicate of a pennant or standard that
represents the cause for which the unit is fighting (such as a national flag or
the blazon of the unit's liege lord). The pennant is consumed in the casting.
