 With over two hundred new spells for wizards and priests and a host of new
magical items, the question of how to use this book may seem fairly obvious to
most players. It appears to be a simple matter of opening the pages, selecting
spells and magical items, and tossing these into a campaign.
<P></P>
 Of course, it can be done that way, but players and DMs who take this route
will miss many of the new possibilities and expansions the <I>Tome of Magic</I> has to offer. On the surface, the <I>Tome of Magic</I> may appear to be just a collection of spells and magical items. But it
contains new game rules and information that goes much deeper.
<P></P>
 This volume introduces a new type of wizard magic, expanded specializations,
new priest spheres, and new variations on priest magic. These rules have the
potential to impact a campaign in a way greater than a first glance might suggest.
To benefit the most from these expansions, the DM should carefully consider
how to introduce and use the new rules.
