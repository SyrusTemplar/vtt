 This spell partially surrounds the recipient in a shimmering, hemispherical
field of force. The field is transparent and moves with the subject, forming a
shell about one foot away from his body. The shell serves as a shield against all
forms of individually targeted missile attacks (including magic missiles and
other spells). The caster designates the position of the shell (protecting the
front, rear, side, or top of the recipient). The spell does not protect against
area effect spells or other attacks that strike several creatures at once.
<P></P>
 Whenever an individual missile attack is directed at a protected creature, the
baneful deflector activates. Instead of striking the target creature, the
missile's target is determined randomly among all creatures within a 15-foot
hemisphere of the protected creature, including the protected creature. The missile
then changes course toward its new target with normal chances to hit. If the new
target is beyond the range of the missile, no target is hit. If the protected
creature is struck, the spell immediately fails. If several people are
protected by <I>baneful deflector</I>, a missile will change course several times before reaching its target.
<P></P>
 The material component is a small prism that shatters when the spell is cast.
