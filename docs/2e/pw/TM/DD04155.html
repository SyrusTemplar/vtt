 The Sphere of Numbers revolves around the concept that numbers and
mathematical relationships between numbers represent the &quot;core truths&quot; of reality or the
&quot;secrets of the universe.&quot; By studying numbers and their relationships, some
scholars believe they can learn truths otherwise inaccessible; by manipulating
numbers, they believe they can actually alter the fabric of reality.
<P></P>
 This sphere uses spells that allow a priest to comprehend and use the
mysteries of numbers. Since many of these spells are incredibly intricate and depend on
very esoteric concepts in mathematics and hypermathematics, only priests with
relatively high intelligence (13 or higher) are allowed access to these spells.
<P></P>
 Spells from this sphere are most likely to be granted by deities of knowledge
(particularly arcane or hidden knowledge).
<P></P>
 Many of the philosophies central to this sphere sound unusual, illogical, or
even insane -- things one might expect to hear from the lips of a senile
&quot;prophet&quot; who has discovered the &quot;truth of All&quot; in the pseudomathematical scratchings
he makes in his notebooks. There are many cranks and charlatans claiming to
predict the future who are often mistaken for true practitioners of this sphere
and vice versa. A priest who is granted spells from the Sphere of Numbers may
sound like a crank when he claims the birth dates of kings predict the date of
Doomsday, but there is one fundamental difference between him and the charlatan:
The priest's spells work.
