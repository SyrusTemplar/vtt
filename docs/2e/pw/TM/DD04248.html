 This spell is similar in effect to <I>wildstrike</I> and <I>wildzone</I>. When cast, a wall of faint, multi-colored lights springs into existence at
the point indicated by the caster. These lights form a line 150 feet long. After
the first round of the spell, the wizard can move the wall of lights. Each
round, the caster can move the wall in the same direction or as much as 45 degrees
to either side. Once the wall is set in motion, it cannot be stopped unless
the spell is cancelled or dispelled. The lights can move 60 feet per round.
<P></P>
 The <I>wildwind</I> has two significant effects. First, all creatures struck by the magical
lights suffer 2d6 points of damage. Second, any spellcaster struck while attempting
to cast a spell automatically triggers a wild surge (use <A HREF="DD04136.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD04136.html">Table 2</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">). Magical items that expend charges that touch the wall of lights
automatically release one charge, also resulting in a wild surge.
