 By means of this spell, the wild mage is able to channel raw magical energy
through himself, shaping it into any form or effect he desires. The energy is
similar in many ways to a <I>wish</I> spell, but has unique differences.
<P></P>
 <I>Wildfire</I> allows the caster to create the effect of any wizard spell of 8th level or
lower. He need only have general knowledge of the spell and its effects; the
spell does not need to be in his own spellbooks.
<P></P>
 Any normal saving throws vs. the spell effects are made at a -2 penalty.
<P></P>
 <I>Wildfire</I> can also be used in the creation of magical items. The energy created by the
spell may be used to generate effects that are not created by known spells.
<P></P>
 <I>Wildfire</I> can also be used to create items out of nothing. The magical energy can be
shaped and hardened to form solid objects. These objects have a greenish, glowing
tinge and radiate magic. These objects are stronger than steel yet possess
almost no weight. They are immune to fire, cold, electricity, and all forms of
magical attack except <I>dispel magic</I> and <I>wish</I> spells. Even if they are subjected to these spells, a saving throw is allowed
(equal to the creator's saving throw vs. spell).
<P></P>
 When creating objects, the caster is limited only by his own skill and the
dimensions of the object. Items larger than a 10-foot-radius sphere cannot be
fashioned. Creating the object requires only one round, regardless of size. Thus, a
wizard could make an impenetrable dome or a small boat with this spell.
<P></P>
 Objects made of <I>wildfire</I> are neither stable nor permanent. Since the object is made of magic separated
from the magical continuum, the material gradually deteriorates until the
magical bonds become too weak to hold the <I>wildfire</I> in the chosen form. This decay takes 1d6+4 hours.
