 When a wizard wishes to create the magical item known as the <I>philosopher's stone</I>, he must first discover its alchemical formula, which tells him the necessary
ingredients and the method of preparing them. This information is not provided
by this spell, and this spell is useless without the formula. (The exact
ingredients and formula are decided by the Dungeon Master and must be discovered by
the wizard by adventuring.)
<P></P>
 When the formula has been discovered and the ingredients prepared, the wizard
enchants the alchemical mixture with the <I>enchant an item</I> spell. <I>Hatch the stone from the egg</I> is then cast upon the mixture. This spell slowly transmutes the mixture into
its final form as the philosopher's stone. The process is completed with a <I>permanency</I> spell.
<P></P>
 The material component for this spell is a magical item known as the <I>philosopher's egg</I>, which is an enchanted retort used to hold the alchemical mixture. The egg is
not destroyed upon completion of the spell and may be used again. (Further
details about the <I>philosopher's egg</I> are found in <A HREF="DD04501.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD04501.html">Chapter 4</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> of this book.)
