 This spell operates exactly like the 3rd-level <I>minor malison</I> spell except that the wizard places a -2 penalty on all saving throws of all
hostile creatures within the area of effect. Optionally, the wizard may create
a -3 penalty to saving throws against spells from one school of magic. This
penalty is not cumulative with a saving throw penalty which derived from the
wizard being a specialist; the penalty is not increased to -4.
