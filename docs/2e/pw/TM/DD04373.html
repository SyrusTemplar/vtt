 This spell causes a localized folding of space. The folded space takes the
form of an invisible disk up to 20 feet in diameter. Any missile weapon or spell
that intersects this disk is instantaneously reversed in direction. Melee
factors such as speed, range, and damage are unaffected; the direction of the object
or force is simply rotated through a 180 degree arc. The sender of the spell or
missile finds himself the target of his own attack.
<P></P>
 The <I>physical mirror</I> operates from only one direction; that is, only one side of the mirror
reflects attacks. The caster of the mirror may direct spells and missile attacks
normally through the space occupied by the mirror.
<P></P>
 In the case of physical attacks, the attacker must roll to hit himself
(without the armor class benefits of Dexterity or shield). Spells turned back may
require the caster to make a saving throw vs. his own spell. In both of these
cases, range is important. If the distance between the initiator of the attack and
the <I>physical mirror</I> is more than twice the range of the attack, the attacker is safe; the attack
has insufficient range to travel from the attacker to the mirror and back again.
<P></P>
 When the priest casts the spell, he must specify the location and orientation
of the <I>physical mirror</I> disk. Once it is created, the disk cannot be moved.
<P></P>
 If two <I>physical mirror</I> disks touch or intersect, they destructively interact and both immediately
vanish. The resulting &quot;ripples&quot; in the space-time continuum are exceedingly
destructive and inflict 3d10 hit points of damage on any creature within 35 yards (a
saving throw is allowed for half-damage). This always includes the casters of
the physical mirror spells.
<P></P>
 The material component is a tiny mirror of polished platinum, worth at least
500 gp.
