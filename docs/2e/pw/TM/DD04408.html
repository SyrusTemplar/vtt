 By casting this spell, the priest reverses certain recent events in the area
of effect. The spell affects only creatures friendly to the priest. The magic
takes effect immediately after the spell is completed rather than at the end of
the round.
<P></P>
 All damage suffered by the priest's allies during the previous turn is undone.
This includes energy drains, poison, and all special attack forms unless these
resulted in instantaneous death. Death from cumulative physical damage is
undone, however. Any creature brought back to life by the <I>reversion</I> spell is not required to make a resurrection survival roll.
<P></P>
 Any spells cast by the priest's allies during the previous turn are restored
and may be used again. This does not apply to magical or spell-like effects from
magical items or scrolls. Material  components consumed in spellcasting during
this time are also restored.
<P></P>
 The <I>reversion</I> spell affects only creatures and characters. Equipment and magical items are
not affected.
<P></P>
 Casting this spell ages the priest one year.
