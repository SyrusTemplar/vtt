<A NAME="598bd5c1"></A><A NAME="598bd5c1"></A><B>Rod of Distortion:</B> This unpredictable device is capable of affecting the operation of all rods,
staves, and wands within a 20-foot radius for a single round. The wielder rolls
1d20. On a roll of 1-15, the <I>rod of distortion</I> does not influence other items. On a roll of 16-19, it acts as a <I>wand of negation</I> and rods, staves, and wands within 20 feet simply do not function during that
round (but are otherwise unaffected). On a roll of 20, the <I>rod of distortion</I> completely disrupts the functioning of rods, staves, and wands. This
distortion results in the backfiring of these devices, causing maximum damage to their
users if the item is used during that round (e.g., a <I>wand of lightning</I> will fire a backward-directed bolt striking its user, a <I>rod of cancellation</I> will affect one random magical item possessed by its owner, and so on). Items
used by the wielder of the rod are unaffected.
<P></P>
 This rod cannot be recharged.
