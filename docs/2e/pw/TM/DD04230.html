 When this spell is completed, one of the caster's hands (his choice) bursts
into light and is surrounded by an aura of flame. The caster suffers no damage
from this effect. Illumination is equal to that of a torch.
<P></P>
 If the wizard successfully touches an opponent, the subject must attempt a
saving throw. If the roll is successful, the flame remains on the caster's hand
(and he may use it to make further attacks until the spell's duration expires)
and the touched creature suffers 1d4+2 points of fire damage. If the save is
failed, the flame leaves the caster's hand to surround the victim's body in an aura
of searing fire. The superheated aura burns for 1 round, inflicting 1d4 points
of damage per level of the caster.
<P></P>
 Instead of attacking a creature, the caster may choose to touch any single
object, which is automatically surrounded by the searing aura for 1 round and must
succeed at an item saving throw vs. magical fire or be destroyed. The aura can
surround an object up to 5 cubic feet in volume per level of the caster.
