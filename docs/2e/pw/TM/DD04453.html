<A NAME="a582af4e"></A><A NAME="a582af4e"></A><B>Wand of Corridors:</B> This wand allows its user to clear short corridors through the plane of
elemental Earth and the quasi-elemental plane of Minerals. It does not function on
any other plane, although it radiates magic. It is especially useful on the
plane of minerals since travelers need not contact the sharp edges of the minerals.
<P></P>
 One charge clears a 10' x 10' x 50' path. The corridor is completed in 1 turn.
The wand has no effect on animals or living creatures. Thus, if the wand
clears a path through a space occupied by an earth elemental, the creature is
unharmed, but is alerted to persons in the corridor. The wand can be recharged.
