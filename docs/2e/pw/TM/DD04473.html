<TITLE>Dimensional Mine-- Miscellaneous Magic (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B>Dimensional Mine:</B> This nasty device can take the form of any small item, but most often appears
as a small figure carved of jet or other black stone, similar to a <I>figurine of wondrous power</I>. As soon as the mine is taken into an extradimensional space, such as that
created by a <I>rope trick, extradimensional pocket</I>, or a <I>bag of holding,</I> it ruptures that space. Everything in the space, including the mine itself,
is spewed into the Astral plane and is lost unless someone can retrieve it. If
the extradimensional space was created by a magical item, such as a bag of
holding, that item is destroyed.
