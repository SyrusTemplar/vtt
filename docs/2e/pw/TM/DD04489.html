<FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B>Lens of Speed Reading:</B> While looking through this lens, the user can read any book, document, or
other written material at three times his normal speed with full comprehension.
When used in conjunction with <I>read magic</I>, the <I>lens of speed reading</I> enables the user to quickly scan scrolls and magical tomes to learn their
contents, but it has no effect on the time required to cast spells. The lens will
not decipher codes, improve illegible writing, or allow magic to be read
without the proper spells.
