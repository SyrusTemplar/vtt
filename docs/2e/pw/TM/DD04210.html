in addition to magic resistance.
<P></P>
 If the victim does not resist the effects of this spell, his magic resistance
is reduced by a base 30% plus 1% per experience level of the wizard casting the
spell.
<P></P>
 This spell has no effect on creatures that have no magic resistance.
<P></P>
 The material component is a broken iron rod.
