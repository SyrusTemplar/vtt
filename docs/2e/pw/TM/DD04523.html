<TITLE>Zwann's Watering Can-- Miscellaneous Magic (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B>Zwann's Watering Can:</B> Invented by the noted botanist Salerno Zwann, this otherwise ordinary
watering can is activated when the user fills it with two gallons of water and lets it
stand undisturbed for 30 days. At the end of that period, the user may
sprinkle the water from<I> Zwann's watering can</I> over a patch of tilled soil no larger than a 25-foot square. Seeds
subsequently planted in this treated soil grow normally, but are permanently immune to
disease, drought (the plants never need to be watered again), insects, bad
weather (such as hailstorms and early frost) and all other forms of nonmagical
trauma. The plants can be harvested normally by the planter.
<P></P>
 Water from <I>Zwann's watering can</I> has no effect on already maturing plants. It cannot revive withered,
diseased, or insect-infested plants.
<P></P>
 The patch of soil retains its effectiveness for one year, after which time it
must be watered again for the effect to be renewed.
