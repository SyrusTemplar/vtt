 A priest may cast <I>warband quest</I> on any group of 200 creatures who are capable of understanding his commands.
The creatures are then affected in a manner similar to the 5th-level priest
spell, quest. Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw with a -4 penalty to
avoid the effects.
<P></P>
 The specified quest must be related to the reason that the Power granted this
spell (perhaps a quest to slay or overcome a specified enemy).
<P></P>
 <I>Warband quest</I> gives subjects of the spell a bonus of 2 hp per level of the caster (maximum
20 hp). Subjects also gain the effects of a <I>prayer</I> spell and have Morale of 18 while on the quest. These benefits last for the
duration of the spell; the spell ends when the specified task is completed. A
creature who abandons the quest is subject to the wrath of his deity.
