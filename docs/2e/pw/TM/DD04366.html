 This spell prevents any dragon who fails its saving throw from entering the
area of effect. The spell affects a cubic area whose sides equal the caster's
level times 5 feet; thus, a 16th-level caster could affect a cube whose sides each
equal 80 feet. The dragon can cast spells, blast breath weapon, or hurl
missiles (if possible) into the area of effect.
<P></P>
 Dragons within the area of effect when the spell is cast are not affected. If
such dragons leave the area of effect, they must succeed a saving throw to
reenter the area.
<P></P>
 The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a dragon scale.
<P></P>
 The spell's effectiveness can be greatly increased with the casting of a <I>focus</I> spell.
