 By casting this spell, the priest transports himself and as many as 50
followers (who must join hands at the time of casting) to the Border Ethereal.
Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw at a -4 penalty to avoid transportation.
<P></P>
 The spell then allows the priest and his party to make as many as three
round-trip journeys to and from the Inner Planes. It then allows them to return to
the Prime Material plane.
<P></P>
 Travel rates in the Ethereal plane are at four times normal speed. Travel
times for locating or searching along curtains are all at the minimum time
possible. Encounters with monsters occur at one-fifth the normal frequency. The priest
and his party are not affected by the ether cyclone.
<P></P>
 The spell expires when the priest and his party return to the Border Ethereal
from an inner plane for the third time. They are then instantly transported to
the Prime Material plane.
