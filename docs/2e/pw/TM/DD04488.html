<TITLE>Law's Banner-- Miscellaneous Magic (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B>Law's Banner:</B> This blazing red standard has the magical ability to raise the morale of
troops when held at the front of a lawful army. The banner inspires any soldier in
the army who is within a quarter-mile of the banner and can see the flag.
Troops inspired in this manner receive a +2 modifier to their base morale as per
BATTLESYSTEM™ rules. In order for an army to be considered lawful, at least 90% of
the troops must be of lawful alignment and no more than 1% can be chaotic. 
<P></P>
 If the banner falls, the effects are lost immediately. If the banner is raised
within 1 turn, the effect returns. If the banner is not raised within 1 turn,
the inspired troops become filled with dread, feeling that the battle has
clearly gone against their cause. The same troops now suffer a -2 morale penalty for
the duration of the battle. The standard may be raised any number of times,
but will improve or impair morale only once per day.
