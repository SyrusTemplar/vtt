 This spell creates a vivid illusion of incoming artillery fire (ballista
bolts, catapult stones, etc.) at a target indicated by the caster. The illusion is
complete, comprising both audial and visual elements. It is impossible for
victims to determine where the missiles were fired from; creatures under attack
notice the missiles only when they are about to strike.
<P></P>
 The missiles never actually strike--they vanish inches above the victims'
heads and do no damage. The illusion is so terrifying, however, that victims must
immediately make a morale check. The first time a group or unit is the target of
this spell, this morale check is made with no modifier. The second and
subsequent times that the same unit is attacked with this spell, the unit receives a
+1 bonus to its morale score (for checks against this effect only) <I>unless</I> the unit has been the target of <I>real</I> artillery fire in the interim. In this case, the bonus does not apply.
<P></P>
 The material component is a small, empty cylinder made of brass.
