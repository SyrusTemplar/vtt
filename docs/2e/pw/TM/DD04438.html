<TITLE>Oil of Preservation (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B>Oil of Preservation:</B> Any nonliving, non-magical object may be coated with a layer of<I> oil of preservation</I>. If every surface of the object is covered, it will suffer no ill effects
from the passage of time. Thus, wood will not rot, metal will not rust, and
masonry will not crumble. The oil provides protection from both natural and magical
aging.
<P></P>
 One flask of <I>oil of preservation</I> will protect 1 cubic foot of surface area. The effects of the oil wear off
after one century, at which time normal aging resumes.
