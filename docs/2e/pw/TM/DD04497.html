<TITLE>Mordom's Cauldron of Air-- Miscellaneous Magic (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B>Mordom's Cauldron of Air:</B> <I>Mordom's cauldron of air</I> is a round pot about two feet in diameter, weighing 60 pounds. There are two
handles on either side of the pot and a compartment built like a small shelf
under the cauldron. The compartment can be filled with wood or coal to heat the
cauldron.
<P></P>
 Although the device is heavy and bulky, the cauldron is valuable for
characters planning an expedition to a place with little or no air. The cauldron
functions as an air generator. To operate the device, the cauldron is filled with
water and a fire is lit in the compartment. When the water boils, vapor is
released. The air from the vapor creates a bubble of breathable air 10 feet in radius
centered on the cauldron.
<P></P>
 The water must not be allowed to spill out of the cauldron and the fire must
be kept burning. As long as these conditions are met, the cauldron will provide
air continuously.
<P></P>
 The air produced is the same temperature as the surrounding environment. The
device needs a minimum of one gallon of water per hour.
