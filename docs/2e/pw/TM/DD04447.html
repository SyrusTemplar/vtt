elements. When one of these rings is discovered, the type is determined randomly.

 Each of these rings has the power to<I> polymorph</I> the wearer into an elemental of the appropriate type. When the transformation
occurs, the subject's equipment is absorbed into his new form. The affected
character retains his mental abilities, but cannot cast spells.
<P></P>
 Characters who are not accustomed to the new form suffer a -2 penalty on
attack rolls until they successfully strike an opponent in two consecutive combat
rounds. After this occurs, it is assumed they have mastered their new shape.
<P></P>
 The <I>polymorphed</I> character acquires the form and physical abilities of the appropriate
elemental. This includes Armor Class (but the character is subject to attacks by
weapons of less than +2 enchantment), movement rates, and attack routines (including
special attacks). Hit points and saving throws are identical to those for the
character's natural form.
<P></P>
 Additionally, the character is immune to damage from exposure to the element
he has become, and may move and breathe freely within the natural element. Thus,
a character metamorphosed into a fire elemental could swim in a pool of
non-magical lava without risk of injury, but the same character could be damaged by
magical fire, such as that from a <I>fireball</I> spell.
<P></P>
 The ring may be used once per day for 1d4+1 turns, at which time the character
reverts to his normal form. The wearer can end the metamorphosis at any time.
When returning to his own form, the wearer regains 1d12 hit points.
<P></P>
 If a successful <I>dispel magic</I> spell is cast upon the subject at any time while he is transformed, he is
forced back into his normal form and must succeed at a system shock roll or die.
The wearer returns to his own form when slain or when the effect is dispelled,
but no hit points are restored in these cases. 
<P></P>
