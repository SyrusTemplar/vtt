<FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B>Jar of Preserving:</B> This piece of magical glassware is able to hold up to one cubic foot of
material. The round jar is equipped with a glass lid that screws into place.

 Any animal or vegetable matter placed in a <I>jar of preserving</I> enters a form of suspended animation. A rosebud never wilts, for example, and
a small animal never ages and does not require food, water, or air. Spell
components placed in the jar never lose potency.
