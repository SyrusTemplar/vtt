<TITLE>Philosopher's Egg-- Miscellaneous Magic (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B>Philosopher's Egg:</B> This item is an enchanted retort: a long-necked piece of glassware in which
substances are distilled. It is a highly prized addition to a wizard's
laboratory, for it has two very important uses.
<P></P>
 The first use of the <I>philosopher's egg</I> is in the creation of any magical or mundane fluid. The time required to
create such a fluid is cut in half through use of the <I>philosopher's egg</I>.
<P></P>
 The <I>egg's </I>second use is as a required component for creating the substance that turns
lead into gold--the legendary philosopher's stone. Thus, it is sometimes said by
wizards that &quot;the stone hatches from the egg.&quot;
