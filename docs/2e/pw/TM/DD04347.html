 This spell enables a number of creatures equal to the caster's level to force
march for a number of days equal to the caster's level. Creatures affected by <I>easy march</I> can travel 2 ½ times their normal movement rate without any risk of fatigue;
thus, they are not required to make a Constitution check at the end of the day.
<P></P>
 All creatures affected by this spell suffer a -1 penalty to their attack rolls
for the duration of the spell; this modifier is not cumulative (that is, a
party experiencing its second day of <I>easy march</I> suffers only a -1 penalty). The modifier cannot be negated by resting. 
<P></P>
 <I>Easy march</I> has no effect on modifiers to movement due to terrain, fatigue, weather, or
other normal factors. (Refer to Chapter 14 of the <A HREF="../PHB/DD01777.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01777.html">Player's Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> for more about force marching.)

 The material component is a piece of shoe leather.
