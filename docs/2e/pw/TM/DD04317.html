 This spell helps to discourage predators and trespassers from disturbing a
campsite. The caster sprinkles salt in a circle enclosing an area up to 50 feet in
diameter. For the duration of the spell, all sounds and scents generated
within the circle are muted, making the area less noticeable to those outside the
circle. Therefore, the group's chance of encounter is reduced by 50% for the
duration of the spell. The spell provides no protection against infravision or
other forms of magical detection.
<P></P>
 The material components are a hair from a skunk, a whisker from a mouse, and
enough salt to make a 50-foot-diameter circle.
