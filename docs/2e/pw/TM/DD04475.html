<TITLE>Dust of Mind Dulling-- Miscellaneous Magic (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B>Dust of Mind Dulling:</B> This harmless-looking dust is the bane of spellcasters. One pinch of this
dust can be flung up to 30 feet from the user and will scatter to fill a
5-foot-radius sphere.
<P></P>
 All spellcasters within the area must make a saving throw versus spell or find
their minds dulled and their wits slowed. All casting times less than 1 round
are increased by 2 as the wizards hesitate, trying to remember the procedures.
Spells which normally require 1 round to cast now require 1 full round plus a
casting time of 5 on the following round; spells which normally have a casting
time of 2 rounds or longer now require 50% longer than normal to cast. The dust
persists in the area for 1 turn unless somehow removed (e.g., a <I>gust of wind</I> spell). Those affected by the dust are impaired in their spellcasting for
1d4+1 turns thereafter.
