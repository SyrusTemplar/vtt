 This spell allows the caster to temporarily convince himself that certain
objects or as many as four creatures within the area of effect do not actually
exist. While <I>disbelief</I> remains in effect, these objects or creatures cannot harm or hinder the
caster. He can pass through them as if they did not exist and takes no damage from
their attacks or actions. However, since these objects or creatures temporarily
do not exist for the priest, he can take no action against them. If the
creatures attack, the caster receives no Dexterity bonus to armor class (since this
bonus represents dodging, and the priest is unable to dodge a creature that does
not exist for him).
<P></P>
 The caster can attempt to disbelieve as many as four creatures within 60 feet
of his position at the time of casting. He disbelieves the same four creatures
for the duration of the spell. Alternatively, the priest can disbelieve any or
all inanimate objects of up to 20-cubic-yard volume (thus, he may disbelieve a
12 foot by 15 foot area of 3-foot-thick wall). This volume must be centered on
a point no more than 20 yards from the caster. These two options are mutually
exclusive; the priest can disbelieve only creatures or objects, not a
combination of both.
<P></P>
 Disbelieving a creature includes all gear, equipment, or treasure carried or
worn by that creature; it does not include other objects that come into contact
with that creature, such as walls, doors, chairs, etc.
<P></P>
 <I>Disbelief</I> is not automatic; it requires an extreme effort. To successfully disbelieve,
the priest must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation. A <I>successful</I> save means the priest has disbelieved; an <I>unsuccessful</I> check means that the spell has failed and the priest has not convinced
himself of the creatures' or objects' non-existence.
<P></P>
 While this spell is in effect, the DM must record any damage suffered by the
priest from disbelieved creatures. When the spell ends, the caster makes a
saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is successful, the priest suffers only
one-eighth of any damage inflicted by the creatures (round all fractions down);
if the priest fails the saving throw, he suffers one-half of any damage
inflicted (round fractions down).
