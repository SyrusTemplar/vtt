 Two circumstances are most likely to warrant the granting of a quest spell to
a priest. First, a Power may contact the priest in a dream or omen, or by
sending a servant or avatar. In this case, the Power requests that the priest
perform a vital service on behalf of the Power (the nature of such a request is
discussed later). The priest is effectively commanded to go on a quest--hence, the
generic title of quest spell.
<P></P>
 A second case for the granting of a quest spell may occur if a priest were to
discover something of fundamental importance to the faith which the Power must
be appraised of (not all powers are omniscient). A priest contacting the Power
(with a commune spell or by prayer) might beseech the Power to grant him some
exceptional magic to address the situation. The request for a quest spell must
never be motivated by selfish considerations on the priest's part (such hubris
is grossly offensive to any Power), and circumstances must be truly exceptional.
The Power then considers the priest's request and responds accordingly.
<P></P>
 In game terms, the first condition translates to the DM using a quest spell as
a plot device to spice up a quest for the priest and his party. The second
condition translates to a player requesting exceptional aid for his priest PC
followed by the DM's decision whether to allow this.
