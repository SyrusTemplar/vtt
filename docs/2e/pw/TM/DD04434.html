<TITLE>Murdock's Insect Ward-- Aromatic Oil (Tome of Magic)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B>Murdock's Insect Ward:</B> This fragrance is a boon to travelers, since it repels insectoid creatures
(both normal and monstrous) that come within 5 feet of the wearer of this
fragrance. Insectoid monsters with Intelligence scores of 5 or more are allowed a
saving throw vs. spell. If successful, they suffer no effects and may remain near
the wearer without need of further saving throws. If the save is failed, the
creature cannot approach within 5 feet of the wearer. (Note that this still may be
close enough to cause harm.) One dose is effective for 1d3+1 hours.
