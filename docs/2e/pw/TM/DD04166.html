 This spell increases the amount of time a character can hold his breath. As
described in the <A HREF="../PHB/DD01779.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01779.html">Player's Handbook</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, a character can hold his breath for a number of rounds equal to one-third
his Constitution score. The effect of this spell is added to that figure.
<P></P>
 The duration of the spell is always unknown to the recipient; the DM secretly
rolls 1d4 to determine the exact duration. At the end of this time, the
character must succeed a Constitution check or be forced to take a breath as per the
rules.
