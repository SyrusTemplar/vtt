 Zone of sweet air</I> creates an invisible barrier around the area of effect that repels all
noxious elements from poisonous vapors, including those created magically (such as a <I>stinking cloud</I>). The spell offers no protection against poisonous vapors created by a
dragon's breath weapon (such as the chlorine gas of a green dragon). Noxious gases
already within the area of effect when the spell is cast are not affected. Fresh
air passes into the area normally.
<P></P>
 If a poisonous vapor is expelled within the area of effect (for example, a <I>stinking cloud</I> is cast), the spell takes effect normally but dissipates in half the time
normally required.
<P></P>
 The spell affects a cube whose sides equal the caster's level times 10 feet
(for instance, a 10th-level caster could affect a cube whose sides are 100 feet
long).
<P></P>
 The material components are the priest's holy symbol, a silk handkerchief, and
a strand of spider web.
