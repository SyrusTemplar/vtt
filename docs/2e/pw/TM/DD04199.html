appear to be someone else. The caster must possess an accurate portrait of the
individual to be duplicated, or must have a clear mental image of the person based
on personal experience.

 If <I>animate dead</I> is cast on the body, it can be animated to become a zombie that looks exactly
like the copied person. The double is a mindless automaton, however, having
