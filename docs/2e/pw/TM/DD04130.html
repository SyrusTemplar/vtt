 An important thing for both the DM and players to remember is that the
existence of <I>Tome of Magic</I> does not mean that everything in it needs to be rushed into play. If the need
for a particular spell does not exist right away, don't worry. Sooner or
later, a player or DM will discover that it suits his needs perfectly. Properly
used, the <I>Tome of Magic</I> will become a source of surprises and inspiration for many adventures to
come.
