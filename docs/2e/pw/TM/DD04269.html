 When the words of this spell are uttered, a holy symbol appropriate to the
priest's deity appears out of thin air. The item appears in the priest's hands. It
may be used as a component for spells or for any other purpose for which the
priest would normally use his holy symbol (such as turning undead). He may also
opt to give it to a lower level priest of the same deity. The holy symbol is a
permanent object.
