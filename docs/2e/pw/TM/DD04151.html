 Cooperative spells are unique to priests. These spells allow several priests
to combine their abilities to create a greater effect. <I>Combine</I> is one type of cooperative spell.
<P></P>
 Cooperative spells do not require a focus or devotional energy; all that is
required are two or more clerics of sufficient level to cast any cooperative
spell. Casting times for cooperative spells are not excessive and their results are
spectacular, making cooperative magic practical and useful to adventuring
priests.
<P></P>
 All priests who attempt cooperative magic must know the spell to be cast and
must be of the same ethos. Generally, only priests of the same religion can use
cooperative magic. However, priests of deities known to work in close harmony
are sometimes able to use cooperative magic with each other. The decision lies
with the DM, since the relations between different deities vary greatly from
campaign to campaign.
