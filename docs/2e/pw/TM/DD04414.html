 A priest casting this spell conjures 1d4+2 plant creatures which have
statistics identical to shambling mounds of 11HD. These creatures will aid the caster
in combat or battle, perform a specific mission, or serve as bodyguards. The
creatures remain with the priest for seven days unless he dismisses them. If the <I>stalkers</I> are summoned only for guard duty, however, the duration of the spell is seven
months. In this case, the <I>stalkers</I> can only be ordered to guard a specific site or location.
<P></P>
 The <I>stalkers</I> gain resistance to fire as per shambling mounds only if the terrain is
suitable (marshy, close to a body of water, etc.)
