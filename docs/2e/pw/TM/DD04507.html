<FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B>Reglar's Gloves of Freedom:</B> These gloves appear to be thick, leather, combat gloves. Silvered pearls are
sewn along the stitching.
<P></P>
 A character under the influence of a <I>charm</I> spell or similar enchantment can be freed of the enchantment by shaking hands
with the wearer of the gloves. This item frees only characters who are
enchanted against their will. Those who have willingly submitted to a charm (such as a<I> quest</I>) are not affected by the gloves. The former victim retains all memories of
his enchantment.
<P></P>
 The gloves do not protect or release the wearer from such spells.
