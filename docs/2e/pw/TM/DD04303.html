 This spell increases the amount of time that fruits, vegetables, and grains
remain wholesome and ripe. The spell will not take effect upon meat of any kind.
<P></P>
 The caster can affect as much as 100 cubic feet of plant material per level.
Thus, even a low level priest could effectively keep a farmer's grain from
rotting while in storage or keep the fruit on the trees in his orchard ripe until
they are harvested. This spell does not prevent pests (such as rats) from eating
the food.
<P></P>
 The material component is a pinch of sugar.
