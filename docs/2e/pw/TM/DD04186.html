 With this spell, the wizard empowers himself and others of his choosing with
the ability to speak a secret language incomprehensible to others. Creatures
designated to speak the language must be touching each other when the spell is
cast.
<P></P>
 Once cast, the characters can choose to speak normally or in their secret
tongue. They can speak and understand this mysterious language fluently.
<P></P>
 <I>Fool's speech</I> is not recognizable as any known language, nor does it remotely sound like
any language. A <I>comprehend languages</I> or <I>tongues</I> spell will not translate it. It can be understood by a character wearing a <I>helm of comprehending languages and reading magic</I>, although the normal percentage chances apply.
<P></P>
 The material component is a small whistle made of bone.
