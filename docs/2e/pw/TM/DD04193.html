 Upon completion of this spell, the caster's eyes glow blue and he is able to
see the magical auras of spellcasters and enchanted objects. Only the auras of
those things normally visible to the caster are seen; this spell does not grant
the wizard the ability to see invisible objects, nor does it give him X-ray
vision. This spell does not reveal the presence of good or evil or reveal
alignment.
<P></P>
 While <I>wizard sight</I> is in effect, a wizard is able to see whether someone is a spellcaster and
whether that person is a priest or a wizard (and what type of specialist, if
any). He can sense if a nonspellcaster has the potential to learn and cast wizard
spells (e.g., whether a fighter will someday gain the ability to cast a spell).
<P></P>
 Although a spellcaster's level cannot be discerned, the wizard can see the
intensity of a spellcaster's aura and guess at the individual's magical power
(dim, faint, moderate, strong, overwhelming). This can be extremely ambiguous even
when a wizard has some method of comparison; the DM might announce that a
subject's intensity is roughly equivalent to that of a companion, or he might
announce that a subject's aura is the strongest the wizard has ever encountered.
<P></P>
 An object's magical abilities cannot be discerned. The fact that it is magical
and the type of magic (abjuration, alteration, etc.) are obvious. The wizard
can see the intensity of an item's magical aura and guess at its power, but
cannot tell whether a magical item is cursed.
