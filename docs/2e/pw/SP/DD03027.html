<TITLE>Astrology-- Nonweapon Proficiency (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Astrology:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This character has a general understanding of the movement of celestial
bodies, and the influence of that movement upon the beings of the campaign world.
The astrologer can identify numerous constellations, and knows many of the
legends behind their naming. The character can make limited predictions for the
future, always in vague terms—whether these are accurate is up to the DM. A
character with this proficiency gains +2 on all checks made using the navigation
proficiency, providing the stars can be seen. A character with the trait of empathy
gains a +1 bonus to the astrology proficiency rating.
