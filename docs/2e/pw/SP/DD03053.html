<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hunting:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The hunting proficiency allows a character to find game and get reasonably
close to it. The actual kill is handled using rolls to hit and for damage.
Hunting is a proficiency that always requires a successful proficiency check when it
is used.
<P></P>
 If the check is successful, the hunter will reach a position within 1d100 +
100 yards of the quarry. Generally it will take about 2–12 daylight hours to
reach this position, though an abundance or scarcity of game can decrease or
increase this time at the DM’s option. Night hunting might be possible for characters
with infravision.
<P></P>
 The hunter also possesses a basic skill at removing skin from an animal, and
butchering the carcass into usable meat. These tasks require no checks.
