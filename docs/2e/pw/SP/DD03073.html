<TITLE>Seamanship-- Nonweapon Proficiency (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Seamanship:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> These characters are trained to help operate galleys and sailing ships. They
can row, hang rigging, steer a helm, patch canvas, and repair hulls (with tar
or pitch). This proficiency does not allow characters to navigate.

 The captain of a vessel, who presumably possesses this skill at a high level,
must make proficiency checks to avoid certain hazards of the sea. Such a seaman
might take the ship into a reef-lined bay with no difficulty if a local pilot
is there to act as a guide. But if the captain has to pick a path through
coastal breakers, a failed check might mean a bump on the bottom of the hull, or
that the ship has run aground. Bad weather and treacherous currents can penalize
these proficiency checks, while fair breezes and superb visibility should convey
positive modifiers.
