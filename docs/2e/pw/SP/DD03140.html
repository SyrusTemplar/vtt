<TITLE>Tongue-Tied-- Disadvantage (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Tongue-Tied:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This disadvantage crops up when the character tries to discuss important
topics with companions and NPCs. The character has the tendency to incorrectly
state facts, forget names, and just generally say the wrong thing. The main effect
of the disadvantage is to enhance role-playing, though the DM should modify NPC
reaction rolls, typically by –2.
