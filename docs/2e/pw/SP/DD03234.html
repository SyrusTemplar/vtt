 With this power, the user can detect auras (the normally invisible envelope of
colored light that surrounds all living things). Each use of the power gives
the user one piece of information—either the target’s alignment (one portion of
it) or relative level of power, but not both simultaneously.
<P></P>
 This power can be used twice per round (for two PSP costs and with two MTHAC0
rolls) to examine two different auras or the same aura twice. The user can be
discreet, but he needs to gaze at the target. Using the power from a distance is
less noticeable than using it up close.
<P></P>
 The level (or Hit Dice) of the target character affects the MTHAC0 roll. The
higher the level of the target, the tougher it is to interpret the aura. The
power’s MAC should be improved by 1 for every three levels (or HD) the target has,
rounded down. For example, an 8th-level target improves the power’s MAC by 2,
making it MAC 5 (and therefore harder to roll against).
<P></P>
 The DM should relate game-related information in a story sense, rather than in
mechanical terms. In the case of alignment, the user sees colored light that
represents an element: 1) blue (lawful); 2) gray (neutral); 3) red (chaotic); 4)
white (good); or 5) black (evil). Relative level of power can be described as
follows: 1) dim aura (a low-level target, 1st to 5th level); 2) bright aura (a
mid level target, 6th to 13th level); 3) dazzling aura (a high-level target,
14th to 20th level); and 4) blinding aura (a target above 20th level).
