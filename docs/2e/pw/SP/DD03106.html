<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Keen Hearing: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This trait means that the character possesses excellent aural acuity—able to
hear the proverbial pin drop. In cases where hearing can be a factor in avoiding
surprise, this character receives a +1 bonus. This applies whenever the PC
approaches an ambush, unless background noise (a waterfall, bustling marketplace,
windstorm, etc.) could be expected to drown out the inadvertent sounds of the
ambushers.
<P></P>
 If the character is a thief, this trait adds +10% to every attempt to<I> detect noise</I>. Halflings can purchase this trait for 1 less character point than the listed
amount.
