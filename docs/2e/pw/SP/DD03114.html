<TITLE>Obscure Knowledge-- Trait (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Obscure Knowledge:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The character with this trait is the fantasy version of the trivia buff. The
character has a mind that grasps, permanently, little bits of information from
here and there—items that, at first blush, might not have any useful
application. The typical procedure for the character using this trait would require an
Intelligence/Learning check. If the check is successful, the character has stored
away some trivial bit of information about a topic at hand.
<P></P>
 The use of this trait is up to the DM, though the player can make requests
when an opportunity arises. For example, as the character approaches Castle
Dunleven, the player might ask the DM if his character remembers anything about the
castle or its occupants. If the Intelligence/Learning check is successful, the
DM can inform the character that Lord Dunleven is an elderly widower, who has a
beautiful daughter whom he jealously guards against any potential suitors. Or,
just as likely, the character might remember that Dunleven is known for its
fine wines or cheeses, and that the vintage of five years back is particularly
prized. Gnomes can purchase this Trait for 1 character point less than the listed
amount.
