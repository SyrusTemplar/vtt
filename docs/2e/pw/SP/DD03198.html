<TITLE>Ego Whip (EW) -- Psionic Attack (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Ego Whip (EW)
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This attack assaults a target’s self-esteem and individuality. It strikes like
a glowing whip, its crack slicing open the wells of inferiority and
worthlessness buried deep behind the target’s defenses. For every 4 PSPs put into the
attack (declared after a successful attack roll is made), the attacker rolls 1d6
to determine psionic damage against his foe. If hit, the defender loses that
many PSPs or has his mind opened to further psionic contact if no PSPs remain. A
failed attack costs 2 PSPs.
<P></P>
 Ego whip has three ranges: short (40 yards), medium (80 yards), and long (120
yards). At medium range, the defender receives a +2 bonus to his MAC; at long
range, the bonus is +5.
<P></P>
 If used against an open mind, ego whip leaves the target dazed for 1d4 rounds,
costing the attacker 4 PSPs. Though no psionic defenses remain, the attacker
must roll the defender’s MAC to successfully hit (this attack receives a +2
bonus). While dazed, all of a character’s die rolls (attacks rolls, saving throws,
etc.) receive a –5 penalty, and the character can’t cast spells above 3rd level.
