<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Character Backgrounds</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">  Now that the character’s numbers have been generated, it’s time to flesh out
a background. This Player’s Option book introduces several new elements to
developing characters’ histories and personalities. Two of these elements, traits
and disadvantages, are detailed in <A HREF="DD03089.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03089.html">chapter six</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">. Briefly, traits are minor benefits or advantages that players can purchase
with character points. These include: internal compass, keen eyesight, light
sleeper, lucky, and precise memory.
<P></P>
 Disadvantages are minor hindrances or inconveniences that yield bonus
character points. Some disadvantages are: allergies, clumsy, colorblind, greedy, lazy,
unlucky, and a number of phobias. Players might want to look ahead to the
traits and disadvantages section of <A HREF="DD03116.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03116.html">chapter six</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> to get an idea of which traits and disadvantages they want to work into a
character’s background.

<A NAME="fe296d2c"></A><A NAME="fe296d2c"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Background Events
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> 
<P></P>
 Another new aspect of character creation is determining the events that turned
a player’s character into an adventurer.
<P></P>
 Below is a list of 20 sample events that might have sent a character on a life
of adventure. After all, every character needs some reason to live such a
dangerous life. The list can be expanded, and details can be added about each
event. Recommended nonweapon proficiencies that could fit with the listed background
event are included for reference and inspiration. Roll 1d20 to randomly
determine a background, or choose one that suits the character.
<P></P>
<A NAME="3b888163"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Accused of a crime:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The character is publicly accused of a crime he did not commit. It might be a
case of mistaken identity, or the character could have been framed for a
crime. The character was forced to flee and become an adventurer rather than face
certain punishment. <I>Suggested NWPs:</I> Any.
<P></P>
<A NAME="0e997639"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Apprenticeship:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The character entered into an apprenticeship—an arrangement where a practiced
craftsman taught him a skill in exchange for money or services.
Apprenticeships need not be limited to mundane trades; characters can enter into
apprenticeships with other adventurers. Many a fighter began his career as a mere squire,
and more than one young person with a talent for the Art signed with the local
hedge wizard.<I> Suggested NWPs:</I> Vocational skills such as animal handling, animal training, blacksmithing,
boat piloting, cobbling, engineering, gem cutting, sculpting, weaving, and so on.
Adventuring skills such as blind-fighting or spellcraft also might be learned.
<P></P>
<A NAME="6aa3926e"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Enslaved:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The character was a slave or indentured servant. The details of the
character’s escape are left to the player and the DM. It is likely such a character will
carry a grudge against those who owned him or will strive fervently to free
other slaves. <I>Suggested NWPs:</I> Survival, hunting, fishing, foraging, bowyer/fletcher, and weaponsmithing.
<P></P>
<A NAME="c0486431"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Exiled:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> For some reason—bad behavior, an unacceptable profession, an incompatible
alignment, shady associates, etc.—the character is banished from his family. Or
perhaps the character is cast out from the society in which he was raised. The
offense could be a breach of some tribal or community law or religious taboo.
With nowhere to turn, the character is forced to live by his wits. The PC might
develop many skills, including thieving abilities. <I>Suggested NWPs:</I> Fire-building, fishing, tracking, hunting, healing, herbalism, set snares,
and survival.
<P></P>
<A NAME="5c8e780e"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Failed business venture:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Perhaps the character was a cobbler and opened a shoe store. Maybe he owned a
tavern, was a brewer, or made a living painting portraits. No matter the
character’s profession, his business venture failed and he had to pursue another
line of work—as an adventurer.<I> Suggested NWPs:</I> Any appropriate to the character’s previous profession.
<P></P>
<A NAME="118b43a0"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fell in love: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The character becomes attracted to someone, and their relationship propels the
character toward an adventuring career. Perhaps the love interest is an
adventurer, whom the character accompanies on quests. The love interest might be
outside the character’s social class, and either or both families could protest or
attempt to end the courtship. The outcome of the romance is left to the player
and the DM. Questing to find a lost love or to avenge the loss of one can make
for powerful role-playing and exciting adventures. <I>Suggested NWPs:</I> Dancing, etiquette, gaming, musical instrument, and so on.
<P></P>
<A NAME="8039c25d"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fled a disaster:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The character’s homeland suffered a tremendous disaster—an earthquake, flood,
plague, or war. The character managed to escape, perhaps just barely. Without
a home to return to, the character becomes an adventurer, maybe with the goal
of preventing the spread or future occurrence of the disaster that cost his
home. Or it could be he searches for loved ones lost when the disaster struck. <I>Suggested NWPs:</I> Hunting, fishing, set snares, fire-building, and survival.
<P></P>
<A NAME="83a90549"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Found or stole a valuable item:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The character uncovered or stole something of value or interest to others. It
could be gold; jewelry or gems; a minor magical item; a map to a dungeon, lost
city, or treasure hoard; a prized horse and carriage; or a glass slipper.
Whatever the item, someone wants it back. The previous owner might believe the
character stole the item—whether the PC actually did. Or the owner might try to
reward the observant character for recovering the item. Either way, this item can
be the cause of a long-term relationship between the character and the owner.
This background event also helps explain how a 1st-level rogue gained his
abilities.<I> Suggested NWPs:</I> Appraising, forgery, gem cutting, heraldry, and other skills that allow the
character to notice the item’s true worth.
<P></P>
<A NAME="8a6d2678"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Homeless:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The character has no place to live. Perhaps he sold the homestead to raise
money for an adventuring career. Maybe his property was seized by unscrupulous
means. The landlord could have foreclosed, or the land could have been
confiscated by the crown for back taxes. With nothing to hold the character in one place,
he sets out on a life of adventure—and, perhaps, revenge. <I>Suggested NWPs:</I> Agriculture, mining, carpentry, and local history.
<P></P>
<A NAME="5b170621"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ideological differences:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The character wasn’t comfortable in the society in which he was raised. The
character could be religious in an agnostic culture, lawfully-inclined in a
chaotic society, or disgusted by his homeland’s evil practices. One example of the
latter is Drizzt Do’Urden and his loathing of the drow culture from which he
came. The character leaves his society behind to find one that suits him better.<I> Suggested NWPs:</I> Any.
<P></P>
<A NAME="83348045"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Joined the circus:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Many are fascinated by the color, excitement, and romance of a traveling
troupe of performers. The character was one such person, and he left home and
hearth behind to take up a life with entertainers. <I>Suggested NWPs:</I> Juggling, jumping, musical instrument, tightrope walking, throwing, singing,
dancing, tumbling, and ventriloquism.
<P></P>
<A NAME="b120e020"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Kidnapped: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The character was kidnapped as a young child. The kidnappers could be evil
relatives, people wandering through the character’s homeland, monsters, or simply
strangers who want to raise a family and can’t have children of their own. The
details are left to the player and DM. As many kidnappers might not make
effective parents, the character likely would become self-sufficient. Perhaps the
character is obsessed with finding his natural parents or discovering where he is
from and who he really is. <I>Suggested NWPs:</I> Survival, hunting, fishing, foraging, bowyer/fletcher, and weaponsmithing.
<P></P>
<A NAME="ebcfe136"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Killed someone:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Either through intent or accident, someone dies and the character is accused.
The authorities and the victim’s relatives are after the character, and if
caught, the character will likely face death. <I>Suggested NWPs:</I> Skills such as disguise, survival, and forgery would be useful in evading
capture.
<P></P>
<A NAME="13ac15ec"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Made an enemy:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The character has an eternal foe. This foe could be a business competitor, a
rival for a lover, a relative overcome by jealousy, or a villain the character
defeated but did not kill. Whatever the case, this enemy caused the character to
flee and take up the adventuring life.<I> Suggested NWPs: </I>Any.
<P></P>
<A NAME="132f0cb3"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Orphaned:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The character’s parents died when the character was young. Causes include:
sickness, war, assassination, accident, or mysterious disappearance. Parents who
mysteriously vanished might be alive, but they’ve been gone so long that
everyone, including the character, believes them lost forever. Perhaps the character
was raised in a group home or in a state or religious institution. Maybe the
character became a street urchin with budding thief skills. The particulars are
left for the player and the DM. <I>Suggested NWPs:</I> Any.
<P></P>
<A NAME="f1d393ed"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ran away from home:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The character fled home early in life. Possible reasons include: boredom,
wanting to see the world, breaking free from an unhappy home life, and wanderlust.
Perhaps someone searches for the character, and the character believes someone
is hounding him. <I>Suggested NWPs:</I> Any.
<P></P>
<A NAME="77d92a5a"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Reformed: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The character was a criminal who decided to change his lifestyle. Perhaps he
saw how his villainous acts hurt others, or maybe he became a victim, too, and
decided it was time to change professions. Because the character is likely
wanted in one or more communities, he had to take on the adventuring life, traveling
from place to place with no plans to settle down. Such an individual might go
out of his way to help those victimized by crimes or to prevent young people
from pursuing criminal careers. <I>Suggested NWPs:</I> Appraising, forgery, disguise, gaming, and gem cutting.
<P></P>
<A NAME="f51d4ec6"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Touched by magic:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The character became an adventurer because something magical happened in his
life. Perhaps he was ripped from his home world or plane because he unknowingly
triggered a portal. Maybe he was an animal who became a man because of a
wizard’s experiment. Or he could have been a priest killed in a disaster and
reincarnated into a new form—and he must start a career from scratch. The
possibilities are endless. <I>Suggested NWPs:</I> Any.
<P></P>
<A NAME="3a1fe4aa"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Went to sea:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The character is from an ocean-going community or culture and decides to seek
his fortune on the waves. The many lands and peoples he encounters open his
eyes to the diversity in the world.<I> Suggested NWPs: </I>Boat piloting, rope use, seamanship, navigation, and weather sense.
<P></P>
<A NAME="9fa0fdd1"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Witnessed a crime:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The character saw, heard, or has evidence that a terrible crime took place.
However, turning in the culprits is not possible. The culprits might be powerful
in local politics, they could be foreign spies or saboteurs, or the crime may
be so out of character for them that simply no one would believe the
character’s outrageous accusation against them. In any case, the culprits would not be
made to pay for their crimes and thus would be free to take vengeance against the
witness. Perhaps the player character’s family sent him away to avoid
retribution. Or maybe the character fled on his own to protect others. <I>Suggested NWPs:</I> To flee the criminals, the character might need to learn disguise, reading
lips, running, endurance, ventriloquism, navigation, boat piloting,
charioteering, and seamanship.
