<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Climate Sense:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This trait provides a character with an innate sense of impending (within one
hour) changes in the weather. The DM might require a Wisdom/Intuition check
before the character can make the determination. Other circumstances may be
obvious enough that the character will know with certainty that the temperature will
fall drastically, or that a tremendous rainstorm is about to begin.
