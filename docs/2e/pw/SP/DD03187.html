 The power of music and words has long been acknowledged as an important source
of inspiration and amusement. The School of Song concentrates on spoken
spells, using the wizard’s skill at weaving melody, lyrics, and rhythm to create
enchantments of great power. Elves and great bards have tapped into this source of
magic for countless years, but now more wizards are investigating the
intriguing possibilities of this school of magic. Musical proficiency or knowledge is
not a strict requirement for this school, but most song wizards are also virtuoso
vocalists—the subtleties of pitch and expression can have tremendous effect in
the casting of the spell.
<P></P>
 Song wizards gain the normal benefits and hindrances of a specialist wizard,
including the +1 bonus to saves versus spells of their own school, and a –1
penalty for their target’s saving throw when casting song spells. Note that magical
song or vocal attacks, including a harpy’s song, a banshee’s wail, or a
sphinx’s roar are all considered to be magical sound or song attacks for purposes of
the mage’s saving throw.

 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>The School of Song:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The School of Song is opposed by the Schools of Necromancy, Greater
Divination, and Invocation/Evocation; magical songs are much better suited to tasks of
influence, change, or summoning. All spells appearing in this list are
considered to have neither somatic nor material components for specialist song
mages—song wizards can cast these spells with nothing more than a verbal component.
While this renders song wizards particularly vulnerable to silencing, it also means
that they can cast spells while bound, restrained, or stripped of all their
possessions. The spells of the School of Song are listed below; spells from the <I>Tome of Magic</I> are in italics.
