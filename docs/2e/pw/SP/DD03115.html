<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Precise Memory:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This trait indicates a character who has a “photographic memory.” For
example, once seeing a piece of heraldry, the character will remember what house or
noble that symbol represents. If this character looks at a map, and has the time
to study it in detail, he can be expected to remember that map with a great
deal of accuracy. In most circumstances this memory is fairly automatic. But in
cases of intricate detail, or if a long time lapses since the character first
observed something, the DM can require an Intelligence/Learning check before
providing the player with the information.

 This trait refers primarily to the recollection of things that the character
has seen written down or rendered in artwork. If the character has the <A HREF="DD03066.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03066.html">reading/writing</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> proficiency, it applies also to things that he has read.
