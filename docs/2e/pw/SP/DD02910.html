locations. They are covered with smooth, mottled green hide, with huge frog-like
faces and bulging eyes. Bullywugs are strong swimmers and comfortable in water
or out of it, but they are vulnerable to dehydration once they leave their
native swamps.

 A player character bullywug is actually a member of an advanced variety of
this species, since most bullywugs are savages and marauders of the worst sort.
Common bullywugs are scarcely able to wield a stone spear or club, but advanced
bullywugs are able to wear armor and use most human weapons with little trouble.
