<A NAME="9acd9be3"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Allure:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This trait allows a character to attract romantic attention from NPCs, at the
player’s option. The character can conceal the trait any time, but when it is
in effect it can modify the reaction rolls of NPCs who might be
affected—perhaps by as much as +3. The trait is only effective if there is a reasonable chance
of the PC drawing romantic attention from the NPC—at the very least the NPC
must be of the opposite sex and of at least young adult age.
<P></P>
 A character with the allure trait can receive one henchman above the normal
maximum—if at least one of the henchmen has a romantic interest, however
unrequited and hopeless, with the player character. Elves can purchase this trait for 1
less character point than the listed amount.
