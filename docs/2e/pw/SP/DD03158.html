<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Monsters and Weapon Mastery</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">  No player would be so unfair as to feel that his character should benefit
from weapon mastery rules, while the monsters retain their previous level of
mediocre skill. (Well, okay—no DM would want to allow this!) In a campaign where
characters can achieve levels of specialization and mastery, so, too, can the
monsters. As with PCs, the development of specialization and mastery skills for
monsters should reflect an unusual level of dedication and training.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Determining Monster Weapon Mastery
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Naturally, not all monsters have even the basic requirements for one of their
number to become a weapon master.
<P></P>
 While the final adjudication of monster weapon mastery is up to the DM, some
basic elements should be taken into account:
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Weapons
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The monster in question must use an actual weapon—mastery cannot be obtained
in the use of fangs, claws, breath weapons, etc. Neither can simple weapons such
as clubs or thrown boulders be effectively mastered.
<P></P>
 Additionally, the weapon must be fairly common in that monster’s culture. Such
weapons are usually listed in the monster description as part of the monster
type’s combat repertoire. Some examples: a goblin might become a master in the
spear or short sword; a wemic, the javelin or short sword; troglodytes have been
known to specialize in their unique javelin; tritons, the trident; kuo-toa,
the pincer staff or harpoon; and gnolls, the pole arm or battle axe.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> As a general rule, a monster must have a minimum Intelligence score of 8 to
master a weapon. The higher the intelligence, the greater the likelihood of
encountering a weapon master among a group of the creatures.
<P></P>
 If the creatures are known to be very intelligent, one of them might reach the
level of mastery. Only monsters of high intelligence or greater can aspire to
grand mastery.
<P></P>
 Additionally, intelligence should be the primary indicator of how many
specialists and masters might be encountered in the monsters’ population. The
relatively stupid goblins will have very few individuals even of specialist level,
while the exceptionally intelligent githyanki will likely include a number of
masters and probably a grand master in each sizable tribe.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<A NAME="e7d48771"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Population
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> As with characters, the greater the number of monsters in a campaign world,
the greater the odds that one or more of them will reach the highest levels of
weapon mastery available. Though this does not rule out the case of the solitary
firbolg giant being a grand master in the use of the halberd, it is more likely
that such a skilled individual will be the chieftain of a tribe—or at least
the important bodyguard standing alertly at the high chief’s side.
<P></P>
 For those monsters ranked with improved hit dice for their subchiefs, battle
leaders, captains, etc, the specialists and masters will invariably fall among
the improved HD members of the band. If there is more than one type of elite
monster, the lowest of these will be no more than specialists, with the masters
and grand masters found among the second and third tiers.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Restrictions
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Undead cannot become weapon masters. Likewise lycanthropes, highly chaotic
creatures, and those of good alignment and a generally pacifistic nature will be
very unlikely to generate weapon masters from among their numbers. Monsters of
low intelligence (or less) will be incapable of any level of weapon mastery.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Effects of Monster Weapon Mastery</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
 Monster weapon masters should be more than just beasts with increased attack
and damage chances—though, naturally, they should receive all the benefits
commensurate with their level of weapon skill. Additionally, the DM might create
some special combat benefits for a monster weapon master, reflecting the general
tactics of that monster in play. A troglodyte who masters the use of his
javelin, for example, might modify it by barbing the head and attaching some kind of
light rope. If the weapon hits a target, the monster can reel in the
victim—unless that victim can work free with a successful Strength check. However, the
victim still suffers extra damage from the weapon.
<P></P>
 Beyond these battle considerations, however, monster weapon masters should add
important story and role-playing elements to the campaign. Because of their
increased power and fearsome reputations, these creatures will be generally
feared and obeyed by the lesser monsters of their clan. They will command these
lackeys, sending them on raids or posting them to guard the lair.
<P></P>
 Through encounters with these lackeys, the player characters should learn
details about the weapon master. Beyond his mere existence, the monster should
become a fearsome figure to the PCs. Perhaps its extermination can be used as the
impetus behind an ongoing campaign adventure.
