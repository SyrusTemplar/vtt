<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This attack takes the form of a wave of mental force that jolts a defender’s
mind. For every 10 PSPs put into the attack (declared after a successful attack
roll is made), the attacker rolls 1d12 to determine psionic damage against his
foe. If hit, the defender loses that many PSPs or has his mind opened to
further psionic contact if no PSPs remain. A failed attack costs 5 PSPs.
<P></P>
 Psionic blast has three ranges: short (20 yards), medium (40 yards), and long
(60 yards). At medium range, the defender receives a +2 bonus to his MAC; at
long range, the bonus is +5.
<P></P>
 If used against an open mind, psionic blast causes 1d8 points of physical
damage (hit point loss) for every 10 PSPs put into the attack. While no psionic
defenses remain, the attacker must still roll the defender’s MAC to successfully
hit (with a +2 bonus to the attack roll).
