<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Each time a character advances a level, he gains character points (the DM
decides how many, see <A HREF="DD02863.html#57b7e2df"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02863.html#57b7e2df">Chapter One</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">) to use on weapon and nonweapon proficiencies or to hold for use during the
game. A character can add only one new weapon or nonweapon proficiency per level
advancement unless that character has a special class ability that allows
otherwise. For example, Blutor has just reach 7th level and currently has 5
character points. He can spend these point on one weapon proficiency or one nonweapon
proficiency, but not both. If he has points left after buying a proficiency, he
can spend them to improve his other proficiencies or same them to use during
the game.
