<TITLE>Bruise Easily-- Disadvantage (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Bruise Easily:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This disadvantage can be a real drawback for a character who spends a lot of
time in harm’s way. Every time the character suffers damage from a blunt
weapon, or a mishap such as a fall, he suffers 1 extra point of damage for each die
of damage rolled. This damage is not as long-lasting as normal damage,
recovering at a rate of 1 hit point per turn after the fight. However, if a character’s
hit points are reduced to zero, and some of the points of damage are bruise
damage, he is rendered unconscious but not dead—much like the damage inflicted by
punching.
