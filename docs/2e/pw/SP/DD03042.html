activity for twice as long as a normal character before becoming exhausted. If
the character is ever required to make a Strength/Stamina check or a
Constitution/Fitness check, the character can add his endurance score to his success
number. If the fatigue rules from the <I>Player’s Option: Combat &amp; Tactics</I> book are in play, the endurance proficiency is treated differently (see <A HREF="../CT/DD02440.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="../CT/DD02440.html">Combat &amp; Tactics</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, Chapter One).
