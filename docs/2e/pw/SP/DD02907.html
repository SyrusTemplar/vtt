The average aarakocra stands about five feet tall, with a wingspan of nearly
20 feet. An aarakocra’s feet are powerful talons that can be used to grasp and
manipulate objects, and it also has small wing-hands about halfway along the
leading edge of each wing. Like all true avians, aarakocra have hollow bones, and
most weigh no more than 80 or 90 pounds. The aarakocras’ voices are not
well-suited for common, and they punctuate their speech with caws, screeches, and
whistles.

  Aarakocra are strong and swift fliers, and they can make a special diving
attack with a drop of 200 feet or more. They receive no penalties for aerial
missile fire. Aarakocra avoid grappling or combat on the ground, but their talons
and beak serve as formidable weapons in a pinch. As a race, aarakocra are
extremely claustrophobic, and dislike being indoors or underground.
