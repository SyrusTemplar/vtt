 Rather than simply assigning numbers to subability scores, players can
determine the scores randomly. First, generate the basic ability score; for example,
Leon rolls 3d6 for his character’s Strength score and gets a 13. Second, the
player assigns the base score to one of the subability scores; Leon assigns his
roll of 13 to his character’s Strength/Stamina score. Third, roll a die or flip a
coin to see if the remaining subability score will be better or worse than the
base score. Leon rolls 1d6 and gets a 4, so his character’s Strength/Muscle
score will be higher than Strength/Stamina. Last, add or subtract 1d4 to the base
score to determine the what the second subability actually is; Leon rolls a 3,
so his character’s Strength/Muscle score is 16.
