can supervise the recovery of themselves and others. If the characters tend a
wound on the round immediately after it is inflicted, a successful proficiency
check means that 1d3 points of damage have been restored (to a maximum of the
damage inflicted the previous round). If they tend a wound within one hour of its
infliction, they can heal 1 point with a successful check. No character can
benefit from this proficiency more than once a day.
