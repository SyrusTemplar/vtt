</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Inherent Immunity/Poison:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This trait enhances the character’s natural resistance to poisons—inhaled,
ingested, and injected. The character receives a +1 bonus to all saving throws
versus any kind of toxin. Additionally, the damage done by virulent poisons is
reduced by –1 point per die (to a minimum of 1), and the duration of paralytic
and other temporary poisons is reduced by 1 round (or turn) per die rolled. 
<P></P>
 Dwarves can purchase this trait for 1 less character point than the listed
amount.
