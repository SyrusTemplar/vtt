<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Spellcraft:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> A character with this proficiency gains no actual spell use abilities, but
does possess significant knowledge about spellcasting. Observing or overhearing a
spell being cast, or a getting a good look at the spell components, lets the
character make a proficiency check. Success means the enchantment is recognized.
Modify the check by +2 if the character can both see and hear, and add another
+2 if the spell components are spotted.
<P></P>
 Wizards using this proficiency gain +2 to checks made if the spell being
studied is one from their own specialty or school. Characters with this proficiency
can also make checks to determine if an item is enchanted.
