<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fire-building:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> A character with this proficiency can build a fire in 1d20 minutes, as long
as there is dry wood and some small bits of tinder. Add another d20 minutes for
each of these factors: the wood (or tinder) is wet, it’s raining or foggy, or
the winds are strong. A proficiency check is required if conditions are bad and
the character is forced to work without shelter.
