<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Lucky:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The luck that seems to bless this character is not a matter of improving the
odds of various die rolls, nor of gaining increased benefits to other game
situations. Rather, it is that this character seems to have a knack for being in
the right place at the right time. The DM may require a Wisdom/Intuition check to
determine if the character will be lucky.
<P></P>
 If the party is searching for a way to cross a deep, placid river—and the
lucky character can make an Intuition check, the party will stumble upon a boat
hidden in the reeds by the shore.
