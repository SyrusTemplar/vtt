<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Armor Proficiency</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">  A character can spend a weapon proficiency slot to buy the armor
proficiency, which indicates that he has become used to wearing a protective shell. Unlike
the shield proficiency, the armor proficiency does not improve armor class.
Instead, it reduces the encumbrance penalties for the wearing of a particular
kind of armor. Thus, a character who is fully proficient with the use of his plate
mail, for example, can move around a lot more easily and quickly than can a
character who does not have this proficiency.
<P></P>
 A character with the armor proficiency suffers only half the normal
encumbrance load of his armor. For example, full plate armor weighs 70 pounds. However,
if a character is proficient with that type of armor, the armor has the
encumbrance effect of only 35 pounds. Naturally, the armor retains its full weight for
all other purposes—such as swimming!
