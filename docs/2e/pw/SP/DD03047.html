<TITLE>Forgery-- Nonweapon Proficiency (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Forgery: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This proficiency indicates a skill at creating false documents, mimicking the
handwriting of others, and detecting forgeries. No check is required if the
character is simply trying to duplicate a style of writing—the issuing of an
anonymous military decree, for example. Characters trying to duplicate the
signatures of specific individuals must see those signatures; the DM rolls the
proficiency checks secretly to see if the forgeries are successful. If a character
writes a longer message in a specific hand, the DM rolls the check with a –2
modifier. The DM should also roll the check if a character seeks to determine if
another document is a forgery. On a 20, the character makes the wrong assumption,
whereas a failure with less than 20 means that the character is not sure of the
truth or falsehood of the sample.
