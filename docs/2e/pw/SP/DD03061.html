<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Musical Instrument:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The character can play a specific type of musical instrument, adding an extra
instrument for every character point expended on this proficiency after its
initial purchase. The skill enables the character to play the instrument very
well, though a proficiency check might be required when attempting a very
difficult piece.
<P></P>
 A character with the music/instrumental trait knows how to play two
instruments immediately (when this proficiency is selected). For each character point
spent, two (not one) additional instruments can be learned.
