<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> A nonpsionic mind is one that has never had any PSPs. Its natural state is
closed unless willingly opened or opened by psionic means. If such a target’s mind
has been opened, but the subsequent psionic attack or power used against it
wasn’t successful, the target can attempt to re-close its mind in the next round.
This requires a saving throw vs. paralyzation at no penalty. If a psionic
power was used successfully against the newly opened nonpsionic mind, the target
can still attempt to close its mind, but its saving throw is at a –4 penalty. The
target may attempt to close its mind every round thereafter.
<P></P>
 For a newly opened psionic mind (one whose PSPs have been reduced to 0), the
target can’t attempt to re-close its mind until 1d4+1 rounds have passed. After
the required rounds have passed, the target can make a Wisdom check at a –3
penalty every round thereafter to attempt to close its mind.
<P></P>
 When either a nonpsionic or psionic character succeeds at re-closing his mind,
the following occurs: any psionic power currently in use against the character
ceases to function, and contact between the two minds is broken. If the
power’s effect already took place in the round in which the mind re-closed, the
psionicist expends the full PSP cost. If the power’s effect didn’t take place yet in
the round, then the lower PSP cost is subtracted from the psionicist’s PSP
total (as if the activation attempt failed). If the psionicist wants to
reestablish contact, he’ll have to once again open the target’s mind.
