<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Deep Sleeper:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The character with this disadvantage will only awaken when disturbed by a
very loud noise, or by physical prodding, shaking, etc. When the character does
wake up, it will take 1–6 rounds before he is capable of any action other than
groggily sitting up and trying to figure out what’s going on.
