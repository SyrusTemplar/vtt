etc.—of whatever type are in use in the campaign world. A serviceable piece of
crockery can be made without a proficiency check. If the character attempts to make a
fine-quality piece, it will take about three days for an average-sized
object—and a successful proficiency check. Failure means the object is useless;
success indicates the degree of excellence, with a roll of 1 indicating that the
character has created a work of unique value.
