<TITLE>Phobia-Enclosed Spaces-- Disadvantage (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Phobia—Enclosed Spaces:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This has effects similar to the darkness phobia, though of course the
presence of light is immaterial—this phobia can strike in a lighted room or in a
narrow, winding tunnel. In general, when the ceiling is no more than two feet
overhead, and the walls are within two feet of the character’s outstretched hands,
he’ll have trouble. As with the fear of darkness, the character must check
Wisdom/Willpower before entering an enclosed area.
