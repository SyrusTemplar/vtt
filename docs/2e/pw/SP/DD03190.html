<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The minds of all characters and creatures exist in one of two states: either <I>closed</I> or <I>open</I>. A closed mind has either natural or enhanced defenses that protect it from
unwanted intrusion. Only those things that enter through the normal senses (such
as sight, sound, taste, touch, or smell) can impact on a closed mind. <B><I>The minds of all characters and creatures are naturally closed.</I></B> A character can voluntarily open his or her mind to psionic contact, or a
closed mind can be opened by psionic attack.
<P></P>
 An open mind is not a natural state. For a mind to be open, psionic defenses
must be voluntarily lowered (in the case of a willing subject) or breached by
psionic attack (in an unwilling opponent). A psionicist’s own mind is considered
open when using a psionic power with an area of effect of “personal” (such as
the heightened senses devotion).
