Weapon Proficiency &amp; Mastery

<P></P>
The weapon proficiency rules of the AD&amp;D game have been expanded with the <I>Skills and Powers</I> campaign. Now there is more flexibility in selecting weapon proficiencies,
and there are opportunities to develop those proficiencies to high degrees of
expertise.
<P></P>
 Fighters can still specialize in specific types of weapons, gaining bonuses
for specialization. Character points can be used to advance the weapon
specialization to mastery, which gives a fighter significant advantages in the use of a
weapon.
<P></P>
 Characters of other classes, through the use of character points, can gain
lesser levels of accomplishment in favorite weapons—this is called weapon
expertise.

 Character points tailor various levels of advancement, making improved combat
abilities available to all characters. While it is relatively easy for fighters
to become accomplished in weapons use, it is more difficult for—and requires
more dedication from—characters of different classes who wish to become truly
accomplished with a weapon.

 In this step of the character creation process, all player characters receive
a final allotment of character points to purchase their initial weapon
proficiencies. Any leftover points from the previous chapters can be used here, or
saved for use during play or to acquire abilities later in the character’s career.
The number of CPs awarded to each type of character in this step appears below.

Warriors: 8

Wizards: 3

Priests: 8

Rogues: 6
