<TITLE>Unlucky-- Disadvantage (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Unlucky:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The character with this disadvantage does not suffer penalties on his die
rolls. However, he has the knack for being in the wrong place at the right time.
He can be in a city of 10,000 people—and if there’s one person he doesn’t want
to see, chances are good that individual is approaching around the next corner.
If this character makes a pass at a young woman, she turns out to be the
Captain of the Guard’s daughter. And if only one member of the party loses his
bedroll in a downpour, the unlucky PC is naturally the one to sleep on the cold,
muddy ground.
