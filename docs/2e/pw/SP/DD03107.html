<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Keen Olfactory Sense: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This valuable trait elevates the character’s sense of smell to an uncanny
level. In any case where the character might detect an approaching encounter by
smelling the other party, this character gets a +1 bonus on chances of being
surprised. In addition, this trait gives the character a +2 bonus when using the
hunting proficiency. At the DM’s discretion, the character can make a
Wisdom/Intuition check to determine whether food or drink has been poisoned or otherwise
tainted.
