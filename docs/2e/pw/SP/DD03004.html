Nonweapon proficiencies are an important part of role-playing a character. The
Skills and Powers book offers several new proficiencies and ways in which they
can be employed during a game. The new rules are tailored to the character
point system.
<P></P>
 The use of proficiencies has been modified slightly from straight ability
checks, providing more flexibility and a little more advantage to characters with
less than, say, a 15 or 16 score in a certain ability. Now proficiencies can
develop during the course of a game. Though characters will often start out with
less likelihood of success when using proficiencies, they will have many
opportunities to develop those skills beyond the limits inherent in the old ability
score system.

 In addition, players can select or create traits for their characters, which
are innate advantages such as talents and keen perceptions. A <A HREF="DD03089.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03089.html">list of traits</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> is presented in this chapter. Countering the strengths of the traits is a

creating countless situations for a little comic relief.
