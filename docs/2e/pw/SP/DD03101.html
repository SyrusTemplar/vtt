<TITLE>Inherent Immunity/Disease-- Trait (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Inherent Immunity/Disease:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The character with this trait has a strong resistance to diseases of all
types. When a saving throw is allowed against a possible infection, the character
gains a +3 bonus. If there is an infection, the duration of the disease is
reduced—by one day, week, etc.,—for each die rolled to determine this time period.
This immunity does not apply to magical enchantments and curses, such as
lycanthropy.
