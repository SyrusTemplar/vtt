<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Phobia—Heights:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This character has difficulty climbing ladders and ropes, perching on walls,
and negotiating steep, cliff-side trails. He will be eager to look for another
way around if such a climb is called for, but if he makes a successful
Wisdom/Willpower check he can overcome his fear. If the check fails, however, the
character will do everything possible to avoid the climb. Another check is allowed
2–12 turns later.
