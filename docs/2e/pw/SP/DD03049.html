<TITLE>Gem-Cutting-- Nonweapon Proficiency (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Gem-cutting:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> A character with this proficiency each day can work 1d10 uncut stones into
finished gems. The worker needs good light and an assortment of chisels, hammers,
and hard cutting blades. 
<P></P>
 The gem cutter can do decent work without a proficiency check; the stones cut
will be valued in the typical range for that type of gem. However, if the
cutter seeks to do a unique and very high-quality job, a proficiency check is called
for. Failure means the stone is destroyed, but success results in a gem of
double the usual value.
