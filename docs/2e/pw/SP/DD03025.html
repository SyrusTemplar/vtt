<TITLE>Appraising-- Nonweapon Proficiency (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Appraising:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This skill allows the character to make generally accurate (+ or –10%)
assessments of common objects, including items made of precious metals and gemstones.
The character can also assess, to + or –25%, the value of objects of art,
tapestries, furniture, weapons, etc.—provided a variety of these items are present
in the game world. These assessments require no proficiency checks, and the DM
can roll (d20 or d100) to determine the accuracy of the appraisal.
<P></P>
 A character who passes a proficiency check will be able to identify a forgery
of a valuable object, to make a very accurate assessment of the value of a
common item (within 5%), or to make a general assessment of the worth of an
uncommon item, including artifacts. The DM may wish to roll this check, and on a roll
of 20 the character makes a wildly inaccurate assessment.
