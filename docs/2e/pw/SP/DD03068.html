<TITLE>Religion-- Nonweapon Proficiency (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Religion:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> A character with this proficiency is familiar with the basic tenets of the
major and minor faiths practiced in the campaign world. Observing an act of
religious significance—a blessing of warriors before battle, for example—means the
character understands the importance of the ritual without a proficiency check.
Checks are required to understand the activities of unique or foreign
religions. Additional character points spent on this proficiency can expand a
character’s knowledge to include other religions, or can increase the level of detailed
knowledge about the faiths already studied.
