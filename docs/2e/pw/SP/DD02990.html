<TITLE>Pugilist-- Kit (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Pugilist</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">  Pugilists are characters who prefer to fight with their bare hands. They
might make a living by fighting in a ring. Or perhaps they specialize in martial
arts. They are strong, tough, and fit into any society that allows professional
or street fights. Pugilists make excellent adventurers, as they have quick
reflexes and are good in a brawl with monsters. Adventuring gives them an
additional outlet for their physical side, and it affords them opportunities to travel
to new communities and find new fights.  Players might want to consult the <A HREF="../CT/DD02666.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="../CT/DD02666.html">Combat and Tactics</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> book for information on unarmed combat and martial arts.

 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Social ranks:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Most pugilists come from poorer families in bad parts of town where people
learned to fight to get what or simply to defend themselves. Roll 2d6 to
determine a pugilist’s social rank at the beginning of the campaign.

 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Requirements:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Pugilists must have minimum Strength/Muscle and Dexterity/Balance scores of
14. This kit is barred to the following races: aarakocra, alaghi, bullywug,
centaur, lizard man, minotaur, swanway, thri-kreen, and wemic. The kit is open to
all classes except wizards.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> These characters can select any weapon proficiencies allowed their
adventuring classes. However, they prefer to fight with their hands. Proficiency and
specialization in any form of unarmed combat (punching, wrestling, or martial arts)
is recommended for the pugilist.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended nonweapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Blind-fighting, endurance, running.
<P></P>
 Equipment: Pugilists prefer to fight in loose-fitting street clothes and
unencumbered. They seek magical bracers and rings to make themselves more difficult
to be struck. They will wear armor while adventuring—if their character class
allows it.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended traits:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Keen eyesight, keen hearing, keen sense of touch, light sleeper,
ambidexterity.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Benefits:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Normally, when a character makes an unarmed attack against an armed opponent
or a monster with natural attacks, his foe gains an immediate attack of
opportunity with a +4 bonus to his attack roll. This makes it very dangerous for
unarmed heroes to attack most enemies. However, pugilists are skilled at fighting
armed opponents and monsters with their bare hands; they are treated as if they
were armed when making unarmed attacks.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hindrances:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Pugilists are admired when they are in a ring and the crowd is cheering them
on. However, people from the middle and upper class prefer not to associate
with the ruffians. A pugilist’s Charisma is effectively lowered by 1 when dealing
with those from the middle class and by 2 when speaking to people from the
upper class.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wealth:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Pugilists begin with the normal amount of gold allowed their character class.
