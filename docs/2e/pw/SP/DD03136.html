<TITLE>Phobia-Spiders-- Disadvantage (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Phobia—Spiders:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Like the monster phobia, this character has a problem with arachnids of all
shapes and sizes, naturally including the monstrous varieties. Additionally,
this character must make a Wisdom/Willpower check with a –4 modifier if ensnared
in a web spell. Failure means the character panics to such an extent that he
enwraps himself in the web for the maximum duration of the spell’s effect.
