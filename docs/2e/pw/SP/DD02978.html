<TITLE>Cavalier-- Kit (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Cavalier</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">  This kit is appropriate only for good-aligned characters, as cavaliers are
of brave heart and honorable bearing. They are the devoted heroes of the realm.
Warriors, wizards, and clerics who love their country, their sovereign, and
their people can be cavaliers. Cavaliers are the noblest of nobles, but they do
not use their positions in society simply to further their own ends. They strive
to aid the less fortunate, protect their ruler, and save their country—whenever
the need arises. Cavaliers can be independent, or they might be employed as
agents of the state, perhaps taking orders from the king or queen.
<P></P>
 Social ranks: Though anyone with the right intentions and determination can be
a cavalier, it is more likely these individuals come from the higher echelons
of a community. Roll 2d6 to determine a cavalier’s rank.

 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Requirements:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Cavaliers must have a minimum score of 13 in their class’s prime requisite.
Also, all cavaliers must a minimum Charisma/Leadership of 14. Cavaliers can be
humans, elves, half-elves, or dwarves; this kit is barred to rangers, thieves,
druids, and bards.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Cavaliers can choose any weapons allowable by their class. Swords and lances
are especially appropriate for warrior cavaliers, as they are suitably noble
weapons for cavaliers to carry.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended nonweapon proficiencies:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Etiquette, riding (any), heraldry, history (local or ancient), languages
(modern or ancient), animal handling, dancing, reading/writing, artistic ability,
and gaming.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Equipment:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Cavaliers can equip themselves how they choose. However, a cavalier must
purchase a mount as soon as he can afford one. Not only does a handsome mount
increase the cavalier’s noble bearing, one will likely come in very handy on his
many travels.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Recommended traits:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Allure, artistic ability, glibness, lucky, music/singing, or music/instrument.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Benefits:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> So good-hearted and strong-willed is the cavalier that he gains a +2 saving
throw bonus against all mind-affecting magics. Such magics include, but are not
necessarily limited to: <I>charm person, friends, hypnotism, sleep, irritation, ray of enfeeblement,
fear, confusion, geas, command, enthrall, cloak of bravery, </I>and <I>symbol.</I>
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hindrances:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Most cavaliers have a strong sense of honor, meaning they will only fight
fairly and chivalrously. For example, during a combat on a high cliff-top, the
cavalier’s foe might slip over the edge and manage to catch onto a handhold. The
cavalier could not leave the miscreant to that fate, nor would he loosen his
foe’s grip on the cliff. Rather, the cavalier would help the foe up, and then
continue the combat. Neither would a cavalier kill any enemy no longer capable of
self defense or one who had surrendered in good faith. Because of this code, a
cavalier can be difficult to play properly.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wealth:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Unless the cavalier comes from the lower class, he begins with 150% of the
starting cash for his profession. If he comes from the lower class, he begins
with the normal starting cash.
