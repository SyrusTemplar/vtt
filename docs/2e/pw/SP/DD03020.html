<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ancient History:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Characters with this proficiency are familiar with the legends, rulers, and
writings of a specific historical period in the campaign world. They will
recognize, without a proficiency check, items, scrolls, artwork, etc. of that period.
They will know the main historical figures, such as kings and powerful
villains, and the major circumstances of those individuals’ lives and deaths. With a
successful proficiency check they will recall lesser figures, such as lords,
knights, and heroes, and recall legendary tales, important sigils, and perhaps be
able to decipher a small bit of text, symbols, or hieroglyphics. The obscure
knowledge trait provides a +3 to this character’s proficiency rating.
