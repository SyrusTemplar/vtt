 A character who seeks to create a truly exceptional weapon, can make a
proficiency check after the item is completed. If the check fails, the weapon is
useless, melted down for its bare metal; if the check succeeds, the character has
created a weapon that is worth 50% more than the typical example. These are the
kinds of weapons selected by wizards for enchantment.

 Dwarves get a +1 bonus to their rating with this proficiency.
