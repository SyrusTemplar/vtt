<TITLE>Tailoring-- Nonweapon Proficiency (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Tailoring:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> A character with this proficiency can sew garments out of all types of
cloth—wool, cotton, silk, and well-tanned leather being the most common in the
typical campaign world. The character can use needle and thread. The amount of time
required for a job naturally varies by its complexity, but proficiency checks
are only required if the tailor is attempting to make something truly unique and
spectacular—a coronation gown for the queen, perhaps.
<P></P>
 The tailor can also make field repairs on clothing that has been damaged by
the vagaries of adventuring. These repairs typically require proficiency checks,
with failure indicating that the patch will hold for only a very short time. A
halfling character gains a +1 to this proficiency rating.
