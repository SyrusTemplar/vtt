<TITLE>Using Proficiencies in Play (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Using Proficiencies in Play</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">  The normal procedure is used for making proficiency checks—i.e., a player
rolls a d20 against his character’s chance of success. However, the procedure for
determining a character’s rating for success has been modified.
<P></P>
 When characters initially acquire proficiencies, their chance for success when
they attempt proficiency checks is somewhat limited. <A HREF="DD03011.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03011.html">Table 45</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> lists, for each nonweapon proficiency, the starting rating for success when a
character uses it in play. Note that there are still many opportunities for
automatic success, so the check is only required on the most challenging tasks.
<P></P>
 This base chance of success can be modified by a high or low score in a
relevant ability. Each proficiency on <A HREF="DD03011.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03011.html">Table 45</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> lists one or two abilities (including subabilities) that are beneficial in
the use of that skill. In cases where two abilities are listed, the player can
choose which ability modifies the proficiency. The modifiers are listed on <A HREF="DD03010.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD03010.html">Table 44</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">.
<P></P>
 For example, Blutor the fighter buys an animal handling proficiency, which has
as its initial chance of success a 5. Blutor has a Wisdom/Willpower of 16,
however, so this +3 increases his initial animal handling chance to a roll of 8 or
less on a d20.
<P></P>
 As usual, a character must have the proper tools and other materials, and a
suitable amount of time to get the job done. No successful proficiency check is
going to allow a weaver to render a beautiful blanket out of raw wool in a
single afternoon. The proficiency descriptions give details on the use of each
skill, as guidelines for the DM.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Traits often benefit characters’ use of proficiencies, improving their chances
for success. These improvements are explained in the trait descriptions,
together with which proficiencies they modify.
<P></P>
 The role that traits play on proficiencies should be factored into the number
needed for success and should be listed on the character sheet.

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Nearly all proficiencies include skills that will not require rolls for
success. Many of these are functions of crafts and trades, and may have little use in
the game beyond their economic functions. Given a shop, raw materials, and
plenty of time, a potter can make a pot, a leather worker can make a tent, and a
cobbler can make a pair of shoes or boots without rolling to see if the attempt
is successful.
