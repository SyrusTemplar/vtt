<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Throwing:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Characters with this proficiency add 10' to each range category of thrown
weapons, and increases the damage or the attack roll by +1 each time they throw a
weapon. The player can elect to improve either the damage or attack roll, but
the choice must be announced before the attack is made.
<P></P>
 For each character point spent on this proficiency (after its initial
purchase) a character adds another 5' to thrown weapon ranges. For every 4 additional
character points spent, another +1 on the damage or attack rolls is gained—this
can be used as a +2 on one or the other, or split as a +1 to attack and +1 to
damage.
