<TITLE>Etiquette-- Nonweapon Proficiency (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Etiquette:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Characters with this skill are familiar with the typical manners of formal
interaction—at least as they relate to the culture in the campaign world. They
know what fanfares are required to greet royal visitors, how to seat the lords
and ladies at a table, how to organize the reception line, and how everyone is to
be addressed. None of these tasks require a proficiency check.
<P></P>
 When dealing with a foreign or completely unknown culture, the characters must
pass proficiency checks to correctly gauge the required etiquette. The check
should be modified—+2 if the foreigners are the same race as the character, +1
or more if the character has had some time to observe the foreigners.
<P></P>
 Characters with the empathy trait gain a +2 bonus to their rating with this
proficiency.
