</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ancient Languages:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Adventurers with this proficiency are familiar with at least one ancient
language—i.e. they have the reading/writing proficiency with the chosen languages.
If confronted with an example of a historically-related language, they can
decipher about a paragraph of that tongue with a successful proficiency check. For
each character point spent on this proficiency (after initially acquiring it)
add one additional ancient language to the list of languages a character knows
fluently. The precise memory trait provides a +2 to this proficiency rating.
