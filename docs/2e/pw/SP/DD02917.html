about six and a half feet tall. They have yellow eyes and sharp yellow teeth, and
favor dressing in brightly colored outfits. Hobgoblins wage a perpetual war
with all other intelligent creatures, especially the other humanoid races. And
they are proud of their status as the pariahs of the humanoid cultures. They feel
that they are only weakened by alliances or treaties with other creatures.

 Hobgoblin society is built around war, with military organization, and they
seek out conflict wherever they can find it. Unlike the giff, who believe in the
“rules” of warfare, hobgoblins seek to terrify and antagonize their enemies at
all times. A player character hobgoblin is a rare individual indeed, since
association with “weaklings” and “inferiors” is taken as a sign of weakness and
decadence in hobgoblin society.
