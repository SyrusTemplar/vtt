<TITLE>Empathy-- Trait (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Empathy:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The character with this trait has an innate ability to sense the motivations,
emotions, and possibly the intentions, of others. If the character can observe
a group of NPCs for 1d6 rounds, the DM can allow a Wisdom/Intuition Check.
Success means that the character has understood something significant about the
discussion or plans of those NPCs. The empathetic character does not have to
speak the language of the NPCs (though the DM can allow a +2 modifier if the tongue
is known).
<P></P>
 If the NPCs are of a very different race (such as monsters), the check can be
modified to 1/2 the character’s Wisdom/Intuition score. However, the DM can
also add positive or negative modifiers if the character has an extra long or
short time to observe, or watches from an especially advantageous or
disadvantageous position.
