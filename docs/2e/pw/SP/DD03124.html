<TITLE>Fanaticism-- Disadvantage (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Fanaticism:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This can be a substantial disadvantage for a character, though it requires a
significant role-playing commitment on the part of the player. The fanaticism
can be dedication to a particular cult, religion, or god, or it can be more
worldly-based, in the sense of overwhelming loyalty to a state, to a military
presence, or to a particular leader. 
<P></P>
 Whatever their sources, the different types of fanaticism have several things
in common. If a certain code of behavior is called for by the belief, then the
character must conform to that behavior—even if it conflicts with the immediate
goals of the PC and his companions. While fanaticism is not necessarily evil,
it may certainly become tiresome to those who do not share the fanatic’s
beliefs.
