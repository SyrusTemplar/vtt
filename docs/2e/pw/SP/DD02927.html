horse. The wemic’s leonine body has a human torso where the lion’s neck and
head would be. The leonine body is covered with dusky golden fur, with a white
underbelly, while the human half tends toward a tawny skin tone and a slight
catlike cast to the face and eyes. Wemics are aboriginal nomads who live through
hunting—they use fire and craft weapons and tools, but rarely build any kind of
permanent dwelling. Wemics believe that everything in the world is a living
thing, from the skies to the sun or earth, and they are very superstitious.

 Wemics are playful and curious as cubs, and a small number never grow out of
this stage. Wemic adventurers are most often characters of this sort, although
other wemics may choose to trade with humans or sell their services as guides,
and come into contact with a player character party in that fashion.
