<TITLE>Inherent Immunity/Heat-- Trait (Skills and Powers)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Inherent Immunity/Heat</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">: Like the immunity to cold, this trait confers an advantage on the character
in certain types of climates, and improves saving throw chances against fire-
and heat-based attack forms. The saving throw bonus is a +1, and applies to
saving throws against such magical infernos as red dragon breath and against the
effects of lava or normal fire.

 The DM can determine the benefits conferred by this trait against
environmental heat, such as deserts and tropical weather. In general, under these types of
conditions, a character with this type of immunity can travel twice as far as
his companions without suffering fatigue.
