 Also known as the rancoon and the rawcon, the ranseur resembles a partisan,
except that the ranseur's flukes are longer, resulting in a three-pronged head.
The flukes are, however, shorter than the middle blade. Partisans are sturdier
than ranseurs. The three prongs are large enough to puncture armor or trap a
weapon and disarm the opponent (considered a Called Shot, -4 to hit, see Combat
chapter of <I>The Complete Fighter's Handbook</I>).
