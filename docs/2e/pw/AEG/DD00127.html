 By far the oldest and most often used polearm, the halberd consists of a
cleaverlike axe blade mounted on a staff averaging six feet in length. The axe blade
is balanced at the rear with a fluke, and surmounted by a sharp spike, usually
of quadrangular design. The fluke is sometimes replaced by a hook used to
dismount cavalry. A halberd can be best described as a cross between a spear and an
axe.

 Though a halberd's main function is to dismount cavalry, it may also be
employed as a thrusting weapon and a cutting weapon. It is not a fast weapon, even
compared to other polearms. Still, it does more damage to a man-sized opponent
than all other polearms.
