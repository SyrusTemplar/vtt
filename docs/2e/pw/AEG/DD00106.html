 The mace is a direct descendant of the basic club, being nothing more than a
wooden club with a stone or iron head mounted on one end. The head design
varies, with some being spiked, others flanged, and still others with pyramidical
knobs.
<P></P>
 The mace has existed since man began working with metal. The first maces were
made in order to give the club wielder more power in his swing.
<P></P>
 High-level priests, knights, and even paladins may have a personalized,
decorated mace that serves primarily as a symbol of rank.
<P></P>
 Since the mace is a weapon that requires very little in the way of specialized
training, it is a favored weapon among goblins.
