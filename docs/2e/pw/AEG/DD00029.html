 A small shield is usually round and is carried on the forearm, gripped with
the shield hand. Its light weight as compared to a <A HREF="DD00030.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00030.html">medium shield</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> permits the user to carry other items in that hand, although he cannot wield
or carry another weapon.
<P></P>
 A small shield (approximately 2' in diameter) can be used to protect against
two frontal attacks of the user's choice. Like the <A HREF="DD00028.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00028.html">buckler</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> above, the user can choose which attacks to use his shield against, but must
decide before the attacks are rolled.
<P></P>
<B> Note:</B> Like the buckler, the small shield should be considered a special item used
for defense, not as a general addition to frontal armor class.
