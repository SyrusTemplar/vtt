 Footman's maces originated as heavy wooden truncheons, about two and a half
feet in length and covered with iron studs. As time went by, flanged heads
similar to the horsemen's mace were used instead. This mace is a two-handed weapon.
<P></P>
 There are two different types of footman's maces: an emergency weapon made
from materials at hand and thrown together by a blacksmith, and the maces made by
professional weaponsmiths for troops. In order to reflect the difference
between the two types, the homemade mace should be given a -1 penalty to attack and
damage rolls.
<P></P>
 The hasty, emergency maces are usually a wooden handle with any sort of metal
head attached.
