 Like the fauchard-fork, the hook-fauchard is another attempt to improve the
fauchard. This weapon has a hook fitted on the blade's back. The hook is used to
dismount cavalry. Like its predecessors, it was not a very effective weapon.
Its damage potential is horrible compared to the fauchards that it was supposed
to improve upon, and it is slower than the original fauchard.
