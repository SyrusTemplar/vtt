 The gladius is the first refined version of the short sword. It has a
double-edged blade and a strengthened tip. The grip is made of wood, bone, or ivory and
is topped with a round pommel. The sword is carried on a warrior's right side,
slung from a baldric passing over the left shoulder. In terms of damage and
length, the gladius or drusus resembles the short sword.
<P></P>
 A drusus is a gladius of exceptional quality, and consequently has a series of
special things associated with its care in order to maintain a sharp edge. The
restrictions are listed in <I>The Complete Fighter's Handbook</I> (Equipment Chapter).
