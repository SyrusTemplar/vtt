</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This is a typically a warm woven blanket laid underneath the saddle,
protecting the animal from abrasion and preventing the saddle from shifting. A rider who
uses a saddle without a saddle blanket will quickly wear his horse down (and
might find himself unceremoniously dumped when the saddle shifts).

 Elven and halfling saddle blankets are wonderfully woven and often decorated
with colorful tassles or jingling bells.
