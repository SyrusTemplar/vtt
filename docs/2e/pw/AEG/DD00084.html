 Stone arrows are considered flight arrows for game purposes, except that the
stone arrowheads cause less damage and have a tendency to shatter if they impact
armor or similarly hard surfaces. If a stone arrow hits any object made of
metal, stone, or a harder substance, it has a 20% chance of surviving the hit
without damage to the arrow. If a die roll does not indicate success, the arrow is
still allowed a saving throw vs. crushing blow with a +4 bonus using the
figures for Rock Crystal. Failure indicates that the arrow shatters.

 Stone arrowheads are almond shaped or rhomboid and are usually made from stone
splinters of flint or obsidian.
