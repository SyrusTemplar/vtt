 A trident is a long pole measuring four to eight feet with a metal,
triple-bladed fork on one end. It is not used as a weapon by professional armies, but has
seen some limited use from peasant guerrillas. The trident is normally a tool
used for fishing, with some limited uses as an agricultural or hunting tool. It
is a two-handed weapon.

 Several aquatic races, such as locathah, mermen, sahuagin, and tritons, use
tridents. They realize the versatility of the trident, since it is effective as
both a fishing tool and a weapon.
