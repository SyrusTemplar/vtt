 Also called the bec de faucon, the names mean &quot;crow's beak&quot; and &quot;falcon's
beak&quot; respectively. This pole weapon has a hook much like a bird's beak and is
ideal for cutting open armor like some great can opener. The weapon also has a
hammer or axe side that delivers a solid hit. This is a highly specialized weapon,
designed for the purpose of cutting armor then striking the now unarmored
victim with the other side of the weapon. The pole shaft is eight feet long.
