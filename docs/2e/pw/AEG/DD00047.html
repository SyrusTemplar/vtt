</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> A late period composite armor made from small metal plates sandwiched between
layers of leather, brigandine is the most advanced barding that a typical
village armorer can make. It is not as encumbering as the more restrictive scale,
weighing 70 pounds.

<B> Half brigandine:</B> This barding protects the front half of the horse and weighs 45 pounds.
<P></P>
 The rogues of the road (including occasional adventurers) tend to use half
brigandine because it is light, generally non-encumbering, and easy to care for.
