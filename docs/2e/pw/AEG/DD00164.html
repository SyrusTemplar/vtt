 Crampons are sold in pairs to be attached to hard boots by several leather
straps. Crampons are spiked and gnarled bands of steel that increase the traction
of smooth-soled boots. They can be used to scale rocky cliffs or cross icy
plains. When worn, crampons increase Climbing ability by +15% or Mountaineering
proficiency by +1. Crampons can also be used as a weapon. If a victim is prone,
stomping on the victim while wearing a pair of crampons inflicts 1d2 points of
damage per 100 pounds of weight of the character. If the victim is in melee, a
successful attack roll must be made. Success causes 1 point of damage (only one
foot can thrust). If an attack roll indicates a miss, the wearer must make a
successful Dexterity check to avoid falling. Using crampons in this way ruins them
in a 1d10 rounds of active use.
