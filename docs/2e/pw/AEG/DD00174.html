 A thieves' toolkit comes in a flat, folding leather case or a rolled suede
case and includes dozens of small tools. A set normally contains 20 wires, ranging
in gauge from the thickness of string to that of a slender pencil. Each is
approximately 12 to 18 inches long. These are used to poke into small holes or
push triggers or buttons from a short distance. The toolkit also includes a set of
12 skeleton keys that fit many standard locks. Also in the set are several
screwdrivers, a wire clipper, clamps, and pincers ranging in three sizes from
minute, small, and average. Bundled with this package may be a small chisel,
hacksaw, and hammer.

 In some of the more deluxe toolkits, small vials of metal-eating acids may be
found, along with magnifying glasses and slender pieces of high-tempered steel
that are used as miniature crowbars. A thieves' toolkit will range in weight
and size greatly, depending on the initial cost of the package.
