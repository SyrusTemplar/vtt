 The flail is a sturdy wooden handle attached to an iron rod, a wooden rod with
spikes, or a spiked iron ball. Between the handle and its implement is either
a hinge or chain link. The weapon was originally used as a tool for threshing
grain. Whether a flail is used by a foot soldier or a horseman, the principle is
the same.
<P></P>
 Rumors tell that the flinds' flindbars are in fact a variation of the flail.
This has not been substantiated, and the flinds have no wish to cooperate in the
research.
