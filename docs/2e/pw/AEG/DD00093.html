 This specialized type of dagger is used in conjunction with a sword. It is
used to catch or break an opponent's sword. Some versions of this dagger are
equipped with spring blades that split into three blades at the push of a button.
When such a dagger is employed in this fashion, it cannot be thrown successfully.
<P></P>
 Most parrying daggers have long, straight or curved quillons, and a tough side
ring that extends perpendicular to the blade in order to protect the user's
fingers.

 Unlike the main-gauche, the parrying dagger is made for a specific purpose, to
deflect or break an opponent's weapon. The main-gauche, while also good for
parrying, is less of a weapon-breaker.
