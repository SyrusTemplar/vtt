 A grappling hook is used to secure a rope for climbing. A grappling hook is
normally made of two, three, or as many as four cast iron bent bars welded or
fused together. Deluxe grappling hooks are sometimes available with folding hooks;
thus, they can be folded flat for easy carrying. Such a hook costs
approximately twice the price of an ordinary hook.

 The grappling hook can be thrown easily into a tree, roof ledge, or rocky
crevice. In determining whether a grappling hook catches in the target object, a
normal attack roll is made vs. AC 10. One round is required to throw the hook;
another round is required to retrieve it.

 In an emergency, the DM might allow clever adventurers to fashion a makeshift
grappling hook from a rope and a wooden slat or metal rod. This may be used as
a normal grappling hook.
