 Mages are the most versatile types of wizards, those who choose not to
specialize in any single school of magic. This is both an advantage and disadvantage.
On the positive side, the mage's selection of spells enables him to deal with
many different situations. (Wizards who study within a single school of magic
learn highly specialized spells, but at the expense of spells from other areas.)
The other side of the coin is that the mage's ability to learn specialized
spells is limited compared to the specialist's.

Mages have no historical counterparts; they exist only in legend and myth.
However, players can model their characters after such legendary figures as
Merlin, Circe, or Medea. Accounts of powerful wizards and sorceresses are rare, since
their reputations are based in no small part on the mystery that surrounds
them. These legendary figures worked toward secret ends, seldom confiding in the
normal folk around them.

 A mage who has an Intelligence score of 16 or higher gains a 10% bonus to the
experience points he earns.
