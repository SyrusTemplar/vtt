 By means of the <I>chant</I> spell, the priest brings special favor upon himself and his party, and causes
harm to his enemies. When the <I>chant</I> spell is completed, all attack and damage rolls and saving throws made by
those in the area of effect who are friendly to the priest gain +1 bonuses, while
those of the priest's enemies suffer -1 penalties. This bonus/penalty continues
as long as the caster continues to chant the mystic syllables and is
stationary. However, an interruption (such as an attack that succeeds and causes damage,
grappling with the chanter, or a <I>silence</I> spell) breaks the spell. Multiple chants are not cumulative; however, if the
3rd-level <I>prayer</I> spell is spoken while a priest of the same religious persuasion (not merely
alignment) is chanting, the effect is increased to +2 and -2.
