</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Once your character or party has an encounter and it has been determined
whether or not anyone was surprised, your DM will tell you the range of the
encounter--the distance separating you from the other group. Many factors affect
encounter distance. These include the openness of the terrain, the weather
conditions, whether surprise occurred, and the time of day, to name a few. Although you
do not know the exact distance until your DM tells you, surprise, darkness, or
close terrain (woods, city streets, or narrow dungeons) usually results in
shorter encounter distances, while open ground (deserts, plains, or moors), good
light, or advance warning results in greater encounter distances (see <A HREF="DD01766.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01766.html">Chapter 13</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">: Vision and Light).
