 A <I>grease</I> spell covers a material surface with a slippery layer of a fatty, greasy
nature. Any creature entering the area or caught in it when the spell is cast must
save vs. spell or slip, skid, and fall. Those who successfully save can reach
the nearest non<I>greased</I> surface by the end of the round. Those who remain in the area are allowed a
saving throw each round until they escape the area. The DM should adjust saving
throws by circumstance; for example, a creature charging down an incline that
is suddenly greased has little chance to avoid the effect, but its ability to
exit the affected area is almost assured! The spell can also be used to create a
greasy coating on an item--a rope, ladder rungs, weapon handle, etc. Material
objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while creatures wielding
or employing items receive a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the
initial saving throw is failed, the creature immediately drops the item. A
saving throw must be made each round the creature attempts to use the greased item.
The caster can end the effect with a single utterance; otherwise, it lasts for
three rounds plus one round per level.

 The material component of the spell is a bit of pork rind or butter.
