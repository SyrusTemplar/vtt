 When this spell is cast, a hypnotic pattern is set up that causes one or more
snakes to cease all activity except a semierect, swaying movement. If the
snakes are charmed while in a torpor, the duration of the spell is 1d4+2 turns; if
the snakes are not torpid, but are not aroused and angry, the charm lasts 1d3
turns; if the snakes are angry or attacking, the spell lasts 1d4+4 rounds. The
priest casting the spell can charm snakes whose total hit points are less than or
equal to those of the priest. On the average, a 1st-level priest could charm
snakes with a total of 4 or 5 hit points; a 2nd-level priest could charm 9 hit
points, etc. The hit points can be those of a single snake or those of several
of the reptiles, but the total hit points cannot exceed those of the priest
casting the spell. A 23-hit point caster charming a dozen 2-hit point snakes would
charm 11 of them. This spell is also effective against any ophidian or
ophidianoid monster, such as naga, couatl, etc., subject to magic resistance, hit
points, and so forth.

 Variations of this spell may exist, allowing other creatures significant to a
particular mythos to be affected. Your DM will inform you if such spells exist.
