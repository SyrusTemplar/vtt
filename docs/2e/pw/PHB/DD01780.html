to climb to some degree or another. Climbing ability is divided into three
categories: thief, mountaineer, and unskilled.
<P></P>
 Thieves are the most skilled at climbing. They are the only characters who can
climb very smooth, smooth, and rough surfaces without the use of ropes or
other equipment. They are the fastest of all climbers and have the least chance of
falling.
<P></P>
 Mountaineers are characters with mountaineering proficiency or those the DM
deems to possess this skill. They have a better climbing percentage than
unskilled characters. Mountaineers with proper equipment can climb very smooth, smooth,
and rough surfaces. They can assist unskilled characters in all types of
climbs.
<P></P>
 Unskilled climbers are the vast majority of characters. While they are able to
scramble over rocks, they cannot use climbing equipment or negotiate very
smooth, smooth, and rough surfaces. They have the lowest climbing success rate of
all characters.
