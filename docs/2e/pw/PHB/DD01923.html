 When this spell is cast, a small written symbol appears in the text of any
written work. When read, the so-called sepia snake springs into being and strikes
at the nearest living creature (but does not attack the wizard who cast the
spell). Its attack is made as if it were a monster with Hit Dice equal to the
level of the wizard who cast the spell. If it strikes successfully, the victim is
engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force, frozen and immobilized until
released, either at the caster's command, by a successful <I>dispel magic</I> spell, or until a time equal to 1d4 days + 1 day per caster level has
elapsed. Until then, nothing can get at the victim, move the shimmering force
surrounding him, or otherwise affect him. The victim does not age, grow hungry, sleep,
or regain spells while in this state. He is not aware of his surroundings. If
the sepia snake misses its target, it dissipates in a flash of brown light, with
a loud noise and a puff of dun-colored smoke that is 10 feet in diameter and
lasts for one round.
<P></P>
 The spell cannot be detected by normal observation, and <I>detect magic</I> reveals only that the entire text is magical. A <I>dispel magic</I> can remove it; an <I>erase</I> spell destroys the entire page of text. It can be cast in combination with
other spells that hide or garble text.
<P></P>
 The components for the spell are 100 gp worth of powdered amber, a scale from
any snake, and a pinch of mushroom spores.
