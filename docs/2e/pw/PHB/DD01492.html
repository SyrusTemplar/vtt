</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Druids do not have the same range of spells as clerics. They have major access
to the following spheres: all, animal, elemental, healing, plant, and weather.
They have minor access to the divination sphere. Druids can use all magical
items normally allowed priests, except for those that are written (books and
scrolls) and armor and weapons not normally allowed for druids.
