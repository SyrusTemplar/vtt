 When creating a priest of a specific mythos, careful attention must be given
to the balance of the character's different abilities. A priest strong in one
area or having a wide range of choice must be appropriately weakened in another
area so that he does not become too powerful compared to the other priests in
the game. If a war deity allows a priest the use of all weapons and armor, the
character should be limited in the spells allowed or powers granted. At the other
extreme, a character who follows a deity of peace should have significant
spells and granted powers to make up for his extremely limited or non-existent
choice of weapons. A druid, for example, has more granted powers than a normal
cleric to compensate for his limited armor and spell selection.
