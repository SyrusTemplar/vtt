 When the priest employs this spell, he confers upon the recipient the ability
to see all things as they actually are. The spell penetrates normal and magical
darkness. Secret doors become plain. The exact location of displaced things is
obvious. Invisible things become quite visible. Illusions and apparitions are
seen through. Polymorphed, changed, or enchanted things are apparent. Even the
aura projected by creatures becomes visible, so that alignment can be
discerned. Further, the recipient can focus his vision to see into the Ethereal plane or
the bordering areas of adjacent planes. The range of vision conferred is 120
feet.<I> True seeing</I>, however, does not penetrate solid objects; it in no way confers X-ray vision
or its equivalent. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced
with known magic.
<P></P>
 The spell requires an ointment for the eyes that is made from very rare
mushroom powder, saffron, and fat and costs no less than 300 gp per use.
<P></P>
 The reverse,<I> false seeing</I>, causes the person to see things as they are not: rich is poor, rough is
smooth, beautiful is ugly. The ointment for the reverse spell is concocted of oil,
poppy dust, and pink orchid essence.
<P></P>
 For both spells, the ointment must be aged for 1d6 months.
