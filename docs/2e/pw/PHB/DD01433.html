<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Wisdom (Wis) describes a composite of the character's enlightenment, judgment,
guile, willpower, common sense, and intuition. It can affect the character's
resistance to magical attack. It is the prime requisite of priests; those with a
Wisdom score of 16 or higher gain a 10% bonus to experience points earned.
Clerics, druids, and other priests with Wisdom scores of 13 or higher also gain
bonus spells over and above the number they are normally allowed to use.

conscious effort from the character.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Bonus Spells</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">indicates the number of additional spells a priest (and only a priest) is
entitled to because of his extreme Wisdom. Note that these spells are available
only when the priest is entitled to spells of the appropriate level. Bonus spells
are cumulative, so a priest with a Wisdom of 15 is entitled to two 1st-level
bonus spells and one 2nd-level bonus spell.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Chance of Spell Failure</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">states the percentage chance that any particular spell fails when cast.
Priests with low Wisdom scores run the risk of having their spells fizzle. Roll
percentile dice every time the priest casts a spell; if the number rolled is less
than or equal to the listed chance for spell failure, the spell is expended with
absolutely no effect whatsoever. Note that priests with Wisdom scores of 13 or
higher don't need to worry about their spells failing.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Spell Immunity</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">gives those extremely wise characters complete protection from certain spells,
spell-like abilities, and magical items as listed. These immunities are
cumulative, so that a character with a Wisdom of 23 is immune to all listed spells up
to and including those listed on the 23 Wisdom row.
