 By means of this spell, the wizard is able to create a duplicate of any
creature. The duplicate appears to be exactly the same as the original, but there are
differences: The simulacrum has only 51% to 60% (50% + 1d10%) of the hit
points of the real creature, there are personality differences, there are areas of
knowledge that the duplicate does not have, and a <I>detect magic</I> spell will instantly reveal it as a simulacrum, as will a <I>true seeing</I> spell. At all times the simulacrum remains under the absolute command of the
wizard who created it. No special telepathic link exists, so command must be
exercised in some other manner. The spell creates the form of the creature, but
it is only a zombielike creation. A <I>reincarnation</I> spell must be used to give the duplicate a vital force, and a <I>limited wish</I> spell must be used to empower the duplicate with 40% to 65% (35% + 5 to 30%)
of the knowledge and personality of the original. The level of the simulacrum,
if any, is from 20% to 50% of that of the original creature.
<P></P>
 The duplicate creature is formed from ice or snow. The spell is cast over the
rough form and some piece of the creature to be duplicated must be placed
inside the snow or ice. Additionally, the spell requires powdered ruby.
<P></P>
 The simulacrum has no ability to become more powerful; it cannot increase its
level or abilities. If destroyed, it reverts to snow and melts into
nothingness. Damage to the simulacrum can be repaired by a complex process requiring at
least one day, 100 gp per hit point, and a fully equipped laboratory.
