 By means of this spell, the wizard is able to either send a message or cause
some desired sound effect. The whispering wind can travel as many miles above
ground as the spellcaster has levels of experience, to a specific location within
range that is familiar to the wizard. The whispering wind is as gentle and
unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its
whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of
whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates. The wizard can
prepare the spell to bear a message of up to 25 words, cause the spell to
deliver other sounds for one round, or merely have the whispering wind seem to be a
faint stirring of the air that has a susurrant sound. He can likewise cause the
whispering wind to move as slowly as a mile per hour or as quickly as a mile
per turn. When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains until the
message is delivered. As with the <I>magic mouth</I> spell, no spells may be cast via the <I>whispering wind</I>.
