<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> To determine the initiative order for a round of combat, roll 1d10 for each
side in the battle. Normally, this means the DM rolls for the monsters (or NPCs),
while one of the players rolls for the PC party. Low roll wins initiative. If
more than two sides are involved in combat, the remaining sides act in
ascending order of initiative.
<P></P>
 If both (or all) sides roll the same number for initiative, everything happens
simultaneously--all attack rolls, damage, spells, and other actions are
completed before any results are applied. It is possible for a wizard to be slain by
goblins who collapse from his <I>sleep</I> spell at the end of the round.
