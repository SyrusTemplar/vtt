</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Since a round is roughly a minute long, it should be easy for a character to
move just about anywhere he wants during the course of the round. After all,
Olympic-class sprinters can cover vast amounts of ground in a minute.
<P></P>
 However, a character in an AD&amp;D game is  not an Olympic sprinter running in a
straight line. He is trying to maneuver through a battle without getting
killed. He is keeping his eyes open for trouble, avoiding surprise, watching his
back, watching the backs of his partners, and looking for a good opening, while
simultaneously planning his next move, sometimes through a haze of pain. He may be
carrying a load of equipment that slows him down significantly. Because of all
these things, the distance a character can move is significantly less than
players generally think.
<P></P>
 In a combat round, a being can move up to 10 times its movement rating (see <A HREF="DD01774.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01774.html">Chapter 14</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">: Time and Movement) in feet. Thus, if a character has a movement rating of 9,
he can move up to 90 feet in a round. However, the types of moves a character
can make during combat are somewhat limited.
