<TITLE>Successful Magic Resistance Rolls (Player's Handbook)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="5">Successful Magic Resistance Rolls 
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> A successful magic resistance check can have four different results, depending
on the nature of the spell being resisted:
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Individually Targeted Spells:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">By definition, these spells affect just one creature, and only the targeted
creature rolls for magic resistance (if it has any). If a spell of this type is
directed at several targets, each rolls independently of the others. (An example
of this would be a <I>hold person</I> spell aimed at four creatures, with each creature getting a magic resistance
roll, if they have magic resistance.)
<P></P>
 If the magic resistance roll is successful, the spell has no effect on that
creature. If the spell is targeted only at the creature, the spell fails
completely and disappears. If several targets are involved, the spell may still affect
others who fail their magic resistance roll.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Area-Effect Spells:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">These spells are not targeted on a single creature, but on a point. The
spell's effect encompasses everything within a set distance of that point. A
successful magic resistance check enables the creature to ignore the effect of the
spell. However, the spell is not negated and still applies to all others in the
area of effect.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>In-Place Spells:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">These spells operate continuously in a particular place or on a particular
creature, character, or item. <I>Protection from evil</I> is one example of this kind of spell.
<P></P>
 Magic resistance comes to play only if a creature or item finds himself (or
itself) in the place where the spell is in operation. Even then, magic resistance
may not come into play--nothing happens if the spell isn't of a type that
affects the character. Thus, a <I>part water</I> spell would not collapse simply because a magic resistant creature walked
through the area. A <I>protection from evil</I> spell, which could affect the creature, would be susceptible to magic
resistance.
<P></P>
 If the DM determines that a magic resistance roll is appropriate, and the roll
succeeds, the in-place spell collapses (usually with a dramatic thunderclap
and puff of smoke).
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Permanent Spells:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Magic resistance is insufficient to destroy a permanent spell. Instead, the
spell is negated (within the same guidelines given for in-place spells) for as
long as the magic resistant creature is in the area of effect.
<P></P>
 Thus, a magic-resistant creature might be able to step through a permanent
wall of force as if it weren't there. However, the wall would spring back into
existence as soon as the creature passed through (i.e., no one else can pass
through).
