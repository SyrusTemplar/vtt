 This spell affords the caster or touched creature partial protection from
undead monsters with Negative Energy plane connections (such as shadows, wights,
wraiths, spectres, or vampires) and certain weapons and spells that drain energy
levels. The <I>negative plane protection</I> spell opens a channel to the Positive Energy plane, possibly offsetting the
effect of the negative energy attack. A protected creature struck by a negative
energy attack is allowed a saving throw vs. death magic. If successful, the
energies cancel with a bright flash of light and a thunderclap. The protected
creature suffers only normal hit point damage from the attack and does not suffer
any drain of experience or Strength, regardless of the number of levels the
attack would have drained. An attacking undead creature suffers 2d6 points of
damage from the positive energy; a draining wizard or weapon receives no damage.
<P></P>
 This protection is proof against only one such attack, dissipating immediately
whether or not the saving throw was successful. If the saving throw is failed,
the spell recipient suffers double the usual physical damage, in addition to
the loss of experience or Strength that normally occurs. The protection lasts
for one turn per level of the priest casting the spell, or until the protected
creature is struck by a negative energy attack. This spell cannot be cast on the
Negative Energy plane.
