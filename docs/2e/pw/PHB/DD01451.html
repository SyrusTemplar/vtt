<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Although humans are treated as a single race in the AD&amp;D game, they come in
all the varieties we know on Earth. A human PC can have whatever racial
characteristics the DM allows.
<P></P>
 Humans have only one special ability: They can be of any character class and
rise to any level in any class. Other PC races have limited choices in these
areas.
<P></P>
 Humans are also more social and tolerant than most other races, accepting the
company of elves, dwarves, and the like with noticeably less complaint.
<P></P>
 Because of these abilities and tendencies, humans have become significant
powers within the world and often rule empires that other races (because of their
racial tendencies) would find difficult to manage.
