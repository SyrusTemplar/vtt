</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Rope Use:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This proficiency enables a character to accomplish amazing feats with rope. A
character with rope use proficiency is familiar with all sorts of knots and can
tie knots that slip, hold tightly, slide slowly, or loosen with a quick tug.
If the character's hands are bound and held with a knot, he can roll a
proficiency check (with a -6 penalty) to escape the bonds.

 This character gains a +2 bonus to all attacks made with a lasso. The
character also receives a +10% bonus to all climbing checks made while he is using a
rope, including attempts to belay (secure the end of a climbing rope) companions.
