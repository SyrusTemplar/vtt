 A <I>meteor swarm</I> is a very powerful and spectacular spell which is similar to the <I>fireball</I> spell in many aspects. When it is cast, either four spheres of 2-foot
diameter or eight spheres of 1-foot diameter spring from the outstretched hand of the
wizard and streak in a straight line to the distance demanded by the
spellcaster, up to the maximum range. Any creature in the straight-line path of these
missiles receives the full effect, without benefit of a saving throw. The meteor
missiles leave a fiery trail of sparks, and each bursts as a fireball.
<P></P>
 The large spheres (2-foot diameter) inflict 10d4 points of damage, bursting in
a diamond or box pattern. Each has a 30-foot diameter area of effect, and each
sphere is 20 feet apart along the sides of the pattern, creating overlapping
areas of effect and exposing the center to all four blasts.
<P></P>
 The smaller spheres (1-foot diameter) each have a 15-foot diameter area of
effect, and each inflicts 5d4 points of damage. They burst in a pattern of a box
within a diamond or vice versa, with each of the outer sides 20 feet long. Note
that the center has four areas of overlapping effect, and there are numerous
peripheral areas that have two overlapping areas of effect. A saving throw for
each area of effect will indicate whether full damage or half damage is sustained
by creatures within each area, except as already stated with regard to the
missiles impacting.
