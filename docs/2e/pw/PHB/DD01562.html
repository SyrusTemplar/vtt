<TITLE>Endurance-- Nonweapon Proficiency (Player's Handbook)</TITLE>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Endurance:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A character with endurance proficiency is able to perform continual strenuous
physical activity for twice as long as a normal character before becoming
subject to the effects of fatigue and exhaustion. In those cases where extreme
endurance is required, a successful proficiency check must be made. Note that this
proficiency does not enable a character to extend the length of time that he can
remain unaffected by a lack of food or water.
