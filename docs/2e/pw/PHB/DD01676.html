 Not all weapons perform the same. If they did, there would be no need for the
wide variety of weapons that exists. Only one form of each weapon type, the
most useful one, would be used throughout the world. This is obviously not the
case.
<P></P>
 Aside from the differences in size, weight, length, and shape, certain types
of weapons are more useful against some types of armor than others. Indeed, the
different armors and weapons of the world are the result of an ancient arms
race. Every new weapon led to the development of a new type of armor designed to
counter it. This led to new weapons, which led to new armor, and so on.
<P></P>
 In the AD&amp;D game, weapons fall into several categories, based on how they are
used. The basic categories are slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Slashing weapons</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">include swords, axes, and knives. Damage is caused by the combination of
weight, muscle, and a good sharp edge.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Piercing weapons</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">(some swords, spears, pikes, arrows, javelins, etc.) rely on the penetrating
power of a single sharp point and much less on the weight of the weapon.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Bludgeoning weapons</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">(maces, hammers, and flails) depend almost entirely on the impact caused by
weight and muscle.
<P></P>
 A few weapons, particularly some of the more exotic polearms, fall into more
than one of these categories. A halberd can be used as a pole-axe (a slashing
weapon) or as a short pike (a piercing weapon). The versatility of these weapons
provides the user with a combat advantage, in that the mode most favorable to
the attacker can be used, depending upon the situation.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Natural weapons</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">can also be classified according to their attack type. Claws are slashing
weapons; a bite pierces; a tail attack bludgeons. The DM must decide which is most
appropriate to the creature and method of attack.

than other armors by virtue of the amount and thickness of the metal, but it
still has specific weaknesses against certain classes of weapons.

 <A HREF="DD01677.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01677.html">Table 52</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> lists the weapon vs. armor modifiers applied to the attacker's THAC0, if this
optional system is used. To use this table, the actual armor type of the
target must be known in addition to the target's Armor Class. The bonuses of magical
armor do not change the type of armor, only the final Armor Class.
<P></P>
 This system is used only when attacking creatures in armor. The modifiers are
not used when attacking creatures with a natural Armor Class.
