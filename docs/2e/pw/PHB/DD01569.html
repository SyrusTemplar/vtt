discovered through mining at a rate of 1d10 stones per day. A gem cutter derives no
benefit from the assistance of nonproficient characters. A gem cutter must work
with a good light source and must have an assortment of chisels, small hammers,
and specially hardened blades.

 Uncut gems, while still of value, are not nearly as valuable as the finished
product. If the cutting is successful (as determined by a proficiency check),
the gem cutter increases the value of a given stone to the range appropriate for
its type. If a 1 is rolled, the work is exceptionally brilliant and the value
of the gem falls into the range for the next most valuable gem (the DM has the <A HREF="../DMG/DD00670.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../DMG/DD00670.html">relevant tables</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">).
