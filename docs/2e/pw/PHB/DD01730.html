<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Magic resistance enables a creature to ignore the effects of spells and
spell-like powers. It does not protect the creature from magical weapon attacks or
from natural forces that may be a direct or accidental result of a spell. Nor
does it prevent the protected creature from using his own abilities or from
casting spells and using magical items. It can be effective against both individually
targeted spells and, within limits, area-effect spells.
<P></P>
 If a magic resistance roll fails, and the spell has normal effect, the target
can make all saving throws normally allowed against the spell.
