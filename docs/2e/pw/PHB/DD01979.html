 The <I>Bigby's interposing hand</I> spell creates a man-sized to gargantuan-sized magical hand that appears
between the spellcaster and his chosen opponent. This disembodied hand then moves to
remain between the two, regardless of what the spellcaster does or how the
opponent tries to get around it. Neither invisibility nor polymorph fools the hand
once a creature has been chosen. The hand does not pursue an opponent.
<P></P>
 The size of the hand is determined by the wizard, and it can be from human
size (5 feet) all the way up to titan size (25 feet). It provides cover for the
caster against the selected opponent, with all the attendant combat adjustments.
It has as many hit points as the caster in full health and has an Armor Class
of 0.
<P></P>
 Any creature weighing less than 2,000 pounds trying to push past the hand is
slowed to half its normal movement. If the original opponent is slain, the
caster can designate a new opponent for the hand. The caster can command the hand
out of existence at any time.
<P></P>
 The material component of the spell is a soft glove.
