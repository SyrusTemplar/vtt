 When a <I>levitate</I> spell is cast, the wizard can place it upon his person, an object, or a
single creature, subject to a maximum weight limit of 100 pounds per level of
experience (for example, a 3rd-level wizard can levitate a maximum of 300 pounds). If
the spell is cast upon the wizard, he can move vertically up or down at a
movement rate of 2 per round. If cast upon an object or another creature, the
wizard can levitate it at the same speed, according to his command. This spell does
not empower horizontal movement, but the recipient could push along the face of
a cliff, for example, to move laterally. The spellcaster can cancel the spell
as desired. If the subject of the spell is unwilling, or the object is in the
possession of a creature, a saving throw vs. spell is allowed to determine if
the <I>levitate</I> spell affects it.
<P></P>
 Once cast, the spell requires no concentration, except when changing height. A
levitating creature attempting to use a missile weapon finds himself
increasingly unstable; the first attack has an attack roll penalty of -1, the second -2,
the third -3, etc., up to a maximum of -5. A full round spent stabilizing
allows the creature to begin again at -1. Lack of leverage makes it impossible to
cock a medium or heavy crossbow.
<P></P>
 The material component of this spell is either a small leather loop or a piece
of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end.
