<TITLE>Reading Lips-- Nonweapon Proficiency (Player's Handbook)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Reading Lips:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The character can understand the speech of those he can see but not hear. When
this proficiency is chosen, the player must specify what language the
character can lip read (it must be a language the character can already speak). To use
the proficiency, the character must be within 30 feet of the speaker and be
able to see him speak. A proficiency check is made. If the check fails, nothing is
learned. If the check is successful, 70% of the conversation is understood.
Since certain sounds are impossible to differentiate, the understanding of a
lip-read conversation is never better than this.
