 By casting this spell, the priest creates a powerful magic aura in some
specially prepared object--a string of prayer beads, a small clay tablet, an ivory
baton, etc. This object radiates magic, for it contains the power to
instantaneously transport its possessor to the sanctuary of the priest who created its
magic. Once the item is enchanted, the priest must give it willingly to an
individual, at the same time informing him of a command word to be spoken when the item
is to be used. To make use of the item, the recipient must speak the command
word at the same time that he rends or breaks the item. When this is done, the
individual and all that he is wearing and carrying (up to the maximum
encumbrance limit for the character) are instantly transported to the sanctuary of the
priest, just as if the individual were capable of speaking a<I> word of recall</I> spell. No other creatures can be affected.
<P></P>
 The reversed application of the spell causes the priest to be transported to
the immediate vicinity of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the
command word said. The priest has a general idea of the location and situation of
the item's possessor, and can choose not to be affected by this summons. This
decision is made at the instant when the transportation is to take place.
However, if he chooses not to go, the opportunity is gone forever and the spell is
wasted.
<P></P>
 The cost of preparing the special item (for either version of the spell)
varies from 2,000 to 5,000 gp. The more costly items can transport the subject from
one plane of existence to another, if the DM allows. Note that the same factors
that can prevent the operation of the<I> plane shift</I> and<I> teleport</I> spells can also prevent the use of this spell.
