 Upon casting this spell, the wizard causes a vivid, fan-shaped spray of
clashing colors to spring forth from his hand. From one to six creatures (1d6) within
the area are affected in order of increasing distance from the wizard. All
creatures above the level of the spellcaster and all those of 6th level or 6 Hit
Dice or more are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. Blind or unseeing
creatures are not affected by the spell.
<P></P>
 Creatures not allowed or failing saving throws, and whose Hit Dice or levels
are less than or equal to the spellcaster's level, are struck unconscious for
2d4 rounds; those with Hit Dice or levels 1 or 2 greater than the wizard's level
are blinded for 1d4 rounds; those with Hit Dice or levels 3 or more greater
than that of the spellcaster are stunned (reeling and unable to think or act
coherently) for one round.
<P></P>
 The material components of this spell are a pinch each of powder or sand that
is colored red, yellow, and blue.
