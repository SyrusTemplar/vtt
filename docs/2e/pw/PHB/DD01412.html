</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">If you are switching to the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons game from the Dungeons
&amp; Dragons® game, you have some special adaptations to make. You know
everything you need to about role-playing, but you will need to adjust to doing certain
things different ways.
<P></P>
 Much of the jargon of the two games is very similar. Don't let this mislead
you into thinking that they are the same game. There are many subtle differences
(along with some obvious ones), and you will need to read the rules in this
book carefully to catch them all.
<P></P>
 Pay special attention to the chapters on PC <A HREF="DD01438.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01438.html">races</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> and <A HREF="DD01456.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01456.html">classes</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, <A HREF="DD01515.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01515.html">alignment</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, <A HREF="DD01610.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01610.html">weapons and armor</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, and <A HREF="DD01790.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01790.html">spell descriptions</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">. The terminology of both games is quite similar, sometimes identical, when
discussing these rules. These similarities often hide important differences
between the way the rules work or how the numbers line up.
<P></P>
 Overall, it is best to approach the AD&amp;D game as if it is a completely new
game and be pleasantly surprised when you find overlapping concepts. Don't make
the mistake of assuming that a rule, item, or spell with the same name in both
games works the same way in both games.
