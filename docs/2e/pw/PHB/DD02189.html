 By means of the <I>prayer</I> spell, the priest brings special favor upon himself and his party and causes
harm to his enemies. Those in the area at the instant the spell is completed
are affected for the duration of the spell. When the spell is completed, all
attack and damage rolls and saving throws made by those in the area of effect who
are friendly to the priest gain +1 bonuses, while those of the priest's enemies
suffer -1 penalties. Once the <I>prayer</I> spell is uttered, the priest can do other things, unlike a <I>chant,</I> which he must continue to make the spell effective. If another priest of the
same religious persuasion (not merely the same alignment) is chanting when a
prayer is cast, the effects combine to +2 and -2, as long as both are in effect
at once.
<P></P>
 The priest needs a silver holy symbol, prayer beads, or a similar device as
the material component of this spell.
