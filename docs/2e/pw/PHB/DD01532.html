<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> When a character specializes with a <I>melee</I> weapon, he gains a +1 bonus to all his attack rolls with that weapon and a +2
bonus to all damage rolls (in addition to bonuses for Strength and magic). The
attack bonuses are not magical and do not enable the character to affect a
creature that can be injured only by magical weapons.
<P></P>
 <I>Bow</I> and <I>crossbow</I> specialists gain an additional range category: point blank. Point-blank range
for bows is from six feet to 30 feet. Point-blank range for crossbows is from
six feet to 60 feet. At point-blank range, the character gains a +2 modifier on
attack rolls. No additional damage is caused, but Strength (for bows) and
magical bonuses apply. Furthermore, if the character has an arrow nocked and drawn,
or a bolt loaded and cocked, and has his target in sight, he can fire at the
beginning of the round before any initiative rolls are made.
<P></P>
 Fighters who specialize also gain extra attacks earlier than those who don't
specialize.
