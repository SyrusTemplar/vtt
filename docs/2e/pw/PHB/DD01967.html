 When a <I>shout</I> spell is cast, the wizard gives himself tremendous vocal powers. The caster
can emit an ear-splitting noise that has a principal effect in a cone shape
radiating from his mouth to a point 30 feet away. Any creature within this area is
deafened for 2d6 rounds and suffers 2d6 points of damage. A successful saving
throw vs. spell negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half. Any exposed
brittle or crystal substance subject to sonic vibrations is shattered by a
shout, while those brittle objects in the possession of a creature receive the
creature's saving throw. Deafened creatures suffer a -1 penalty to surprise rolls,
and those that cast spells with verbal components are 20% likely to miscast
them.
<P></P>
 The <I>shout</I> spell cannot penetrate the 2nd-level priest spell, <I>silence, 10[FM] radius</I>. This spell can be employed only once per day; otherwise, the caster might
permanently deafen himself.
<P></P>
 The material components for this spell are a drop of honey, a drop of citric
acid, and a small cone made from a bull or ram horn.
