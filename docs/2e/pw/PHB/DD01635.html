</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Some creatures possess a natural Armor Class already superior to some of the
armor types (for example, the horse is AC 7). However, these creatures can still
benefit from wearing armor of a quality worse than their natural Armor Class.
If the AC of armor is equal to or worse than the AC of the creature, the AC of
the creature improves by 1.
<P></P>
 For example, a horse has a natural AC of 7. The AC of leather armor is 8,
worse than the horse's natural AC. However, if a horse is fitted with leather
barding, its AC drops to 6 since it gains the benefit of the additional protection.
