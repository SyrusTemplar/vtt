 The priest is able to restore life and complete strength to any living
creature, including elves, by bestowing the<I> resurrection</I> spell. The creature can have been dead up to 10 years per level of the priest
casting the spell. Thus, a 19th-level priest can resurrect the bones of a
creature dead up to 190 years. The creature, upon surviving a resurrection survival
check, is immediately restored to full hit points and can perform strenuous
activity. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has reached its allotted
life span (i.e., died of natural causes). Casting this spell makes it impossible
for the priest to cast further spells or engage in combat until he has had one
day of bed rest for each experience level or Hit Die of the creature brought
back to life. The caster ages three years upon casting this spell.
<P></P>
 The reverse,<I> destruction</I>, causes the victim of the spell to be instantly dead and turned to dust. A<I> wish</I> spell or equivalent is required for recovery. Destruction requires a touch,
either in combat or otherwise, and does not age the caster. In addition, the
victim is allowed a saving throw (with a -4 penalty). If the save is successful,
the victim receives 8d6 points of damage instead.
<P></P>
 The material components of the spell are the priest's religious symbol and
holy water (unholy water for the reverse spell). The DM may reduce the chances of
successful resurrection if little of the creature's remains are available.
