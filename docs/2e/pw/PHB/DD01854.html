 When this spell is employed, the wizard can command any nonliving ropelike
object, including string, yarn, cord, line, rope, or even a cable. The spell
affects 50 feet of normal rope (with a 1 inch diameter), plus 5 feet per caster
level. This length is reduced by 50% for every additional inch of thickness and
increased by 50% for each half-inch less. The possible commands are Coil (form a
neat, coiled stack), Coil &amp; Knot, Loop, Loop &amp; Knot, Tie &amp; Knot, and the
reverses of all of the above (Uncoil, etc.). One command can be given each round.
<P></P>
 The rope can only enwrap a creature or an object within 1 foot of it--it does
not snake outward--so it must be thrown or hurled near the intended target.
Note that the rope itself, and any knots tied in it, are not magical. A typical
rope might be AC 6 and take 4 points of slashing damage before breaking. The rope
does not inflict damage of any type, but it can be used as a trip line or to
entangle a single opponent who fails a saving throw vs. spell.
