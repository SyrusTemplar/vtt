 By this spell, the caster calls forth weather appropriate to the climate and
season of the area he is in. Thus, in spring a tornado, thunderstorm, sleet
storm, or hot weather could be summoned. In summer a torrential rain, heat wave,
hail storm, etc., can be called for. In autumn, hot or cold weather, fog, sleet,
etc., could be summoned. Winter enables great cold, blizzard, or thaw
conditions to be summoned. Hurricane-force winds can be summoned near coastal regions in
the later winter or early spring. The summoned weather is not under the
control of the caster. It might last but a single turn, in the case of a tornado, or
for hours or even days in other cases. The area of effect likewise varies from
about 1 square mile to 100 square miles. Note that several casters can act in
concert to greatly affect weather, controlling winds, and working jointly to
summon very extreme weather conditions.
<P></P>
 Within four turns after the spell is cast, the trend of the weather to come is
apparent--e.g., clearing skies, gusts of warm or hot air, a chill breeze,
overcast skies, etc. Summoned weather arrives 1d12+5 turns after the spell is cast.
Note that the new weather condition cannot be changed by the caster once it
has been summoned. Once the weather is fully summoned, it cannot be dispelled. If
the summoning is successfully dispelled before it has been completed, the
weather slowly reverts to its original condition.
