 This spell holds 1d4 humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly
immobile for five or more rounds.
<P></P>
 The <I>hold person</I> spell affects any bipedal human, demihuman or humanoid of man size or
smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins,
half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies,
orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others.
<P></P>
 The spell is centered on a point selected by the caster; it affects persons
selected by the caster within the area of effect. If the spell is cast at three
or four people, each gets an unmodified saving throw. If only two people are
being enspelled, each makes his saving throw with a -1 penalty. If the spell is
cast at only one person, the saving throw suffers a -3 penalty. Saving throws are
adjusted for Wisdom. Those succeeding on their saving throws are unaffected by
the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.
<P></P>
 Held beings cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them
and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not
prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.
The caster can end the spell with a single utterance at any time; otherwise,
the duration is 10 rounds at 5th level, 12 rounds at 6th level, 14 rounds at 7th
level, etc.
<P></P>
 The spellcaster needs a small, straight piece of iron as the material
component of this spell.
