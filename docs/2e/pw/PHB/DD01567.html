<TITLE>Forgery-- Nonweapon Proficiency (Player's Handbook)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Forgery:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This proficiency enables the character to create duplicates of documents and
handwriting and to detect such forgeries created by others. To forge a document
(military orders, local decrees, etc.) where the handwriting is not specific to
a person, the character needs only to have seen a similar document before. To
forge a name, an autograph of that person is needed, and a proficiency check
with a -2 penalty must be successfully rolled. To forge a longer document written
in the hand of some particular person, a large sample of his handwriting is
needed, with a -3 penalty to the check.
<P></P>
 It is important to note that the forger always <I>thinks</I> he has been successful; the DM rolls the character's proficiency check in
secret and the forger does not learn of a failure until it is too late.
<P></P>
 If the check succeeds, the work will pass examination by all except those
intimately familiar with that handwriting or by those with the forgery proficiency
who examine the document carefully. If the check is failed, the forgery is
detectable to anyone familiar with the type of document or handwriting--if he
examines the document closely. If the die roll is a 20, the forgery is immediately
detectable to anyone who normally handles such documents without close
examination. The forger will not realize this until too late.
<P></P>
 Furthermore, those with forgery proficiency may examine a document to learn if
it is a forgery. On a successful proficiency roll, the authenticity of any
document can be ascertained. If the die roll is failed but a 20 is not rolled, the
answer is unknown. If a 20 is rolled, the character reaches the incorrect
conclusion.
