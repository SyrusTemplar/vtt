<FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B>Saving throws
<P></P>
</B>are measures of a character's resistance to special types of attacks--poisons,
magic, and attacks that affect the whole body or mind of the character. The
ability to make successful saving throws improves as the character increases in
level; Dexterity and general mental fortitude aid in honing combat senses.
Experience makes saving throws easier.
