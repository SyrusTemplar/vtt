</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="5">Strength 
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Strength (Str) measures a character's muscle, endurance, and stamina. This
ability is the prime requisite of warriors because they must be physically
powerful in order to wear armor and wield heavy weapons. A fighter with a score of 16
or more in Strength gains a 10% bonus to the experience points he earns.
<P></P>
 Furthermore, any warrior with a Strength score of 18 is entitled to roll
percentile dice (see <A HREF="DD01419.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01419.html">Glossary</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">) to determine exceptional Strength; exceptional Strength improves the
character's chance to hit an enemy, increases the damage he causes with each hit,
increases the weight the character is able to carry without a penalty for
encumbrance (see below), and increases the character's ability to force open doors and
similar portals.
<P></P>
 The rest of this section on Strength consists of explanations of the columns
in <A HREF="DD01426.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01426.html">Table 1</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">. Refer to the table as you read.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hit Probability</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">adjustments are added to or subtracted from the attack roll rolled on 1d20
(one 20-sided die) during combat. A bonus (positive number) makes the opponent
easier to hit; a penalty (negative number) makes him harder to hit.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Damage Adjustment</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">also applies to combat. The listed number is added to or subtracted from the
dice rolled to determine the damage caused by an attack (regardless of
subtractions, a successful attack roll can never cause less than 1 point of damage). For
example, a short sword normally causes 1d6 points of damage (a range of 1 to
6). An attacker with Strength 17 causes one extra point of damage, for a range
of 2 to 7 points of damage. The damage adjustment also applies to missile
weapons, although bows must be specially made to gain the bonus; crossbows never
benefit from the user's Strength.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Weight Allowance</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">is the weight (in pounds) a character can carry without being encumbered
(encumbrance measures how a character's possessions hamper his movement--see <A HREF="DD01419.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01419.html">Glossary</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">). These weights are expressed in pounds. A character carrying up to the
listed weight can move his full movement rate.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Maximum Press</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">is the heaviest weight a character can pick up and lift over his head. A
character cannot walk more than a few steps this way. No human or humanoid creature
without exceptional Strength can lift more than twice his body weight over his
head. In 1987, the world record for lifting a weight overhead in a single move
was 465 pounds. A heroic fighter with Strength 18/00 (see <A HREF="DD01426.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01426.html">Table 1</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">) can lift up to 480 pounds the same way and he can hold it overhead for a
longer time!
<P></P>
<B> </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Open Doors</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">indicates the character's chance to force open a heavy or stuck door. When a
character tries to force a door open, roll 1d20. If the result is equal to or
less than the listed number, the door opens. A character can keep trying to open
a door until it finally opens, but each attempt takes time (exactly how much is
up to the DM) and makes a lot of noise.
<P></P>
 Numbers in parentheses are the chances (on 1d20) to open a locked, barred, or
magically held door, but only one attempt per door can ever be made. If it
fails, no further attempts by that character can succeed.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Bend Bars/Lift Gates</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">states the character's percentage chance (rolled on percentile dice) to bend
normal, soft iron bars, lift a vertical gate (portcullis), or perform a similar
feat of enormous strength. When the character makes the attempt, roll
percentile dice. If the number rolled is equal to or less than the number listed on <A HREF="DD01426.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01426.html">Table 1</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, the character bends the bar or lifts the gate. If the attempt fails, the
character can never succeed at that task. A character can, however, try to bend
the bars on a gate that he couldn't lift, and vice versa.
