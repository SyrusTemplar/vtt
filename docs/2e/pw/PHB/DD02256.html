 The<I> conjure animals</I> spell enables the priest to magically create one or more mammals to attack
his opponents. The total Hit Dice of the mammals cannot exceed twice his level,
if the creature conjured is determined randomly. If a specific animal type is
requested, the animal's Hit Dice cannot exceed his level. The DM selects the type
of animal that appears if it is randomly called. Thus, a priest of 12th level
could randomly conjure two mammals with 12 Hit Dice each, four with 6 Hit Dice
each, six with 4 Hit Dice each, eight with 3 Hit Dice each, 12 with 2 Hit Dice
each, or 24 with 1 Hit Die each. Count every +1 hit point added to a creature's
Hit Dice as ¼ of a Hit Die. Thus a creature with 4 + 3 Hit Dice equals a 4 ¾
Hit Dice creature. The conjured animals remain for two rounds for conjured
animals remain for two rounds for each level of the conjuring priest, or until
slain, and they follow the caster's verbal commands. Conjured animals unfailingly
attack the priest's opponents, but resist being used for any other purpose--they
do not like it, become noticeably more difficult to control, and may refuse any
action, break free, or turn on the caster, depending on the nature of the
creature and the details of the situation. The conjured animals disappear when
slain.
