 This spell temporarily suppresses the subject's life force. The necromancer
points his finger and utters the incantation, releasing a black bolt of crackling
energy. The subject must roll a saving throw vs. spell, adjusted for
Dexterity, to avoid the bolt. Success means the spell has no effect. Failure means the
subject is treated exactly as if he had been drained of energy levels by a
wight, one level for every four levels of the caster. Hit Dice, spells, and other
character details dependent on level are lost or reduced. Those drained to 0th
level must make a system shock check to survive and are helpless until the spell
expires. The spell effect eventually wears off, either after 1d4 hours plus one
hour per caster level, or after six hours of complete and undisturbed rest.
Level abilities are regained, but lost spells must be rememorized. Undead are
immune to this spell.
