<TITLE>Spellcraft-- Nonweapon Proficiency (Player's Handbook)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Spellcraft:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Although this proficiency does not grant the character any spellcasting
powers, it does give him familiarity with the different forms and rites of
spellcasting. If he observes and overhears someone who is casting a spell, or if he
examines the material components used, he can attempt to identify the spell being
cast. A proficiency check must be rolled to make a correct identification. Wizard
specialists gain a +3 bonus to the check when attempting to identify magic of
their own school. Note that since the spellcaster must be observed until the
very instant of casting, the spellcraft proficiency does not grant an advantage
against combat spells. The proficiency is quite useful, however, for identifying
spells that would otherwise have no visible effect.
<P></P>
 Those talented in this proficiency also have a chance (equal to ½ of their
normal proficiency check) of recognizing magical or magically endowed constructs
for what they are.
