 The <I>limited wish</I> is a very potent but difficult spell. It will fulfill literally, but only
partially or for a limited duration, the utterance of the spellcaster. Thus, the
actuality of the past, present, or future might be altered (but possibly only
for the wizard unless the wording of the spell is most carefully stated) in some
limited manner. The use of a limited wish will not substantially change major
realities, nor will it bring wealth or experience merely by asking. The spell
can, for example, restore some hit points (or all hit points for a limited
duration) lost by the wizard. It can reduce opponent hit probabilities or damage,
increase duration of some magical effect, cause a creature to be favorably
disposed to the spellcaster, mimic a spell of 7th level or less, and so on (see the

is based on the time spent preparing the wording for the spell (clever players
decide what they want to say before using the spell). Normally, the casting time
is one round (most of it being taken up by deciding what to say). Casting this
spell ages the caster one year per 100 years of regular life span.
