</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Weapon specialization is obtained by devoting extra weapon proficiency slots
to the chosen weapon. To specialize in any sort of melee weapon or crossbow, the
character must devote two slots--one slot to become proficient with it, and
then a second slot to specialize in it. Any bow (other than a crossbow) requires
a total of three proficiency slots: one for proficiency and two to specialize.
Assume, for the moment, that Rath the dwarf decided to specialize with the
warhammer. Two of his four proficiency slots are thus devoted to the warhammer.
With the two remaining, he can become proficient with the short sword and short
bow (for example).
