<TITLE>Blind-Fighting-- Nonweapon Proficiency (Player's Handbook)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Blind-fighting:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A character with blind-fighting is skilled at fighting in conditions of poor
or no light (but this proficiency does not allow spell use). In total darkness,
the character suffers only a -2 penalty to his attack roll (as compared to a -4
penalty without this proficiency). Under starlight or moonlight, the character
incurs only a -1 penalty. The character suffers no penalties to his AC because
of darkness.
<P></P>
 Furthermore, the character retains special abilities that would normally be
lost in darkness, although the effectiveness of these are reduced by one-half
(proficiency checks are made at half the normal score, etc.). This proficiency is
effective only against opponents or threats within melee distance of the
character. Blind-fighting does not grant any special protection from missile fire or
anything outside the immediate range of the character's melee weapon. Thus, AC
penalties remain for missile fire. (By the time the character hears the whoosh
of the arrow, for example, it is too late for him to react.)
<P></P>
 While moving in darkness, the character suffers only half the normal movement
penalty of those without this proficiency.
<P></P>
 Furthermore, this skill aids the character when dealing with invisible
creatures, reducing the attack penalty to -2. However, it does not enable the
character to discover invisible creatures; he has only a general idea of their location
and cannot target them exactly.
