<TITLE>Disguise-- Nonweapon Proficiency (Player's Handbook)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Disguise:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The character with this skill is trained in the art of disguise. He can make
himself look like any general type of person of about the same height, age,
weight, and race. A successful proficiency check indicates that the disguise is
successful, while a failed roll means the attempt was too obvious in some way.
<P></P>
 The character can also disguise himself as a member of another race or sex. In
this case, a -7 penalty is applied to the proficiency check. The character may
also attempt to disguise himself as a specific person, with a -10 penalty to
the proficiency check. These modifiers are cumulative, thus, it is extremely
difficult for a character to disguise himself as a specific person of another race
or sex (a -17 penalty to the check).
