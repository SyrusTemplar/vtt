 The casting of a <I>gate</I> spell has two effects. First, it causes an interdimensional connection
between the plane of existence the wizard is on and the plane on which dwells a
specific being of great power; thus, the being is able to merely step through the
gate or portal from its plane to that of the caster. Second, the utterance of the
spell attracts the attention of the sought-after dweller on the other plane.
When casting the spell, the wizard must name the entity he desires to use the
gate and come to the wizard's aid. There is a 100% certainty that something steps
through the gate. Unless the DM has some facts prepared regarding the minions
serving the being called forth by the <I>gate</I> spell, the being itself comes.
<P></P>
 If the matter is trifling, the being might leave, inflict an appropriate
penalty on the wizard, or attack the wizard. If the matter is of middling
importance, the being can take some positive action to set matters right, then demand
appropriate repayment. If the matter is urgent, the being can act accordingly and
ask whatever is its wont thereafter, if appropriate. The actions of the being
that comes through depend on many factors, including the alignments of the
wizard and the deity, the nature of his companions, and who or what opposes or
threatens the wizard. Such beings generally avoid direct conflict with their equals
or betters. The being gated in will either return immediately (very unlikely)
or remain to take action. Casting this spell ages the wizard five years.
