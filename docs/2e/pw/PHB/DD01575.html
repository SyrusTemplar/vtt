<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Jumping:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The character can attempt exceptional leaps both vertically and horizontally.
If the character has at least a 20-foot running start, he can leap (broad jump)
2d6+his level in feet. No character can broad jump more than six times his
height, however. With the same start, he can leap vertically (high jump) 1d3 plus
half his level in feet. No character can high jump more than 1-½ times his own
height.
<P></P>
 From a standing start, a character with this proficiency can broad jump 1d6
plus half his level in feet and high jump only three feet.
<P></P>
 The character can also attempt vaults using a pole. A vault requires at least
a 30-foot running start. If a pole is used, it must be four to 10 feet longer
than the character's height. The vault spans a distance equal to 1-½ times the
length of the pole. The character can clear heights equal to the height of the
pole. He can also choose to land on his feet if the vault carries him over an
obstacle no higher than ½ the height of his pole. Thus, using a 12-foot pole, the
character could either vault through a window 12 feet off the ground (tumbling
into the room beyond), land on his feet in an opening six feet off the ground,
or vault across a moat 18 feet wide. In all cases, the pole is dropped at the
end of the vault.
