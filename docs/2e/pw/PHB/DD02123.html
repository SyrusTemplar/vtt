 Using this spell, three to five priests combine their abilities so that one of
them casts spells and turns undead at an enhanced level. The highest-level
priest (or one of them, if two or more are tied for highest) stands alone, while
the others join hands in a surrounding circle. The central priest casts the <I>combine</I> spell. He temporarily gains one level for each priest in the circle, up to a
maximum gain of four levels. The level increase affects turning undead and
spell details that vary with the caster's level. Note that the central priest gains
no additional spells and that the group is limited to his currently memorized
spells.
<P></P>
 The encircling priests must concentrate on maintaining the combine effect.
They lose all Armor Class bonuses for shield and Dexterity. If any of them has his
concentration broken, the <I>combine</I> spell ends immediately. If the <I>combine</I> spell is broken while the central priest is in the act of casting a spell,
that spell is ruined just as if the caster were disturbed. Spells cast in
combination have the full enhanced effect, even if the combine is broken before the
duration of the enhanced spell ends. Note that the combination is not broken if
only the central caster is disturbed.
