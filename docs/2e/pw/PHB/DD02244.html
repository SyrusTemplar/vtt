 The<I> quest</I> spell enables the priest to require the affected creature to perform a
service and return to the priest with proof that the deed was accomplished. The quest
can, for example, require that the creature locate and return some important
or valuable object, rescue a notable person, release some creature, capture a
stronghold, slay a person, deliver some item, and so forth. If the quest is not
properly followed, due to disregard, delay, or perversion, the creature affected
by the spell loses 1 from its saving throw rolls for each day of such action.
This penalty is not removed until the quest is properly pursued or the priest
cancels it. There are certain circumstances that will temporarily suspend a
quest, and others that will discharge or cancel it. The DM will give you
appropriate information as the need to know arises.
<P></P>
 If cast upon an unwilling subject, the victim is allowed a saving throw.
However, if the person quested agrees to a task--even if the agreement is gained by
force or trickery--no saving throw is allowed. If a quest is just and deserved,
a creature of the priest's religion cannot avoid it, and any creature of the
priest's alignment saves with a -4 penalty to the saving throw. A quest cannot
be dispelled, but it can be removed by a priest of the same religion or of
higher level than the caster. Some artifacts and relics might negate the spell, as
can direct intervention by a deity. Likewise, an unjust or undeserved quest
grants bonuses to saving throws, or might even automatically fail.
<P></P>
 The material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol.
