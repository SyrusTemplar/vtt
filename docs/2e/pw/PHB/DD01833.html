 This spell creates a luminous glow, equal to torchlight, within a fixed radius
of the spell's center. Objects in darkness beyond this sphere can be seen, at
best, as vague and shadowy shapes. The spell is centered on a point selected by
the caster, and he must have a line of sight and unobstructed path for the
spell when it is cast. Light can spring from air, rock, metal, wood, or almost any
similar substance.
<P></P>
 The effect is immobile unless it is specifically centered on a moveable object
or mobile creature. If this spell is cast upon a creature, the applicable
magic resistance and saving throw rolls must be made. Successful resistance negates
the spell, while a successful saving throw indicates that the spell is
centered immediately behind the creature, rather than upon the creature itself. Light
taken into an area of magical darkness does not function, but if cast directly
against magical darkness negates it (but only for the duration of the <I>light</I> spell, if the darkness effect is continual).
<P></P>
 Light centered on the visual organs of a creature blinds it, reducing its
attack rolls and saving throws by 4 and worsening its Armor Class by 4. The caster
can end the spell at any time by uttering a single word.
<P></P>
 The material component is a firefly or a piece of phosphorescent moss.
