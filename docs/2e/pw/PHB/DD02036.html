 The magic of this spell is similar to that of the <I>vacancy</I> spell, only more powerful and elaborate. The spell enables the caster to make
an area appear to be something other than it is--a setting he has personally
seen. The spell remains as long as the caster maintains a minimal concentration
upon it. Even after this, the spell persists for a total of one hour plus one
additional turn for each experience level of the caster. (Note: Minimal
concentration can be maintained during normal conversation but not while spellcasting,
in melee, or if harmed by an attack.) If the caster actually uses a small bit
of anything connected with the place to create this spell, it takes on a quasi
reality.

 In its basic form, forceful contact is necessary to have any hope of
discovering the magic, short of a detection device or spell. In its more complex form,
where a material component is used, detection is possible only by some magical
means, whether device, item, or spell. Either form of mirage arcana is subject
to the <I>dispel magic</I> spell.
<P></P>
 As with all powerful illusions, the mind of the believer urges appropriate
effects upon the viewer's body. Under the influence of the spell, the viewer could
possibly walk across a bed of hot coals thinking it was a shallow stream of
water that was cooling his feet (and thus suffer no damage), dine upon imaginary
food and actually be satisfied, or rest comfortably upon a bed of sharp stones,
thinking it a featherbed. Gravity is not affected by the spell, however, so an
envisioned bridge spanning a deep chasm does not support the believer. Those
who witness the event see it as a sudden disappearance of the individual. They
do not connect it with an illusion unless they are otherwise aware of some magic
at work.
