 A <I>spook</I> spell enables the wizard to play upon natural fears to cause the target
creature to perceive the spellcaster as someone or something inimical. Without
actually knowing what this is, the wizard merely advances threateningly upon the
creature. If the creature does not make a successful saving throw vs. spell, it
turns and flees at maximum speed as far from the wizard as possible, though items
carried are not dropped. The creature has a saving throw penalty of -1 for
every two experience levels of the caster, to a maximum of -6 at 12th level. Note
that a natural (unmodified) roll of 20 automatically succeeds, regardless of
saving throw penalties. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing
creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Each round after the initial
casting, the creature receives another saving throw, without penalty, until it
successfully saves and the spell is broken. In any event, the spell functions only
against creatures with Intelligences of 2 or more, and undead are not affected
at all.
