be equal to or greater than the character's saving throw number. The number a
character needs to roll varies depending upon the character's group, his level,
and what the character is trying to save himself from. A character's saving
throw numbers can be found in <A HREF="DD01724.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01724.html">Table 60</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">.

paralyzation, poison, or death magic; petrification or polymorph; rod, staff, or
