<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The human race has one special ability in the AD&amp;D game: Humans can choose to
be of any class-- warrior, wizard, priest, or rogue -- and can rise to great
level in any class. The other races have fewer choices of character classes and
usually are limited in the level they can attain. These restrictions reflect the
natural tendencies of the races (dwarves like war and fighting and dislike
magic, etc.). The limits are high enough so a demihuman can achieve power and
importance in at least one class. A halfling, for example, can become the best
thief in the land, but he cannot become a great fighter.
<P></P>
 The limits also exist for play balance. The ability of humans to assume any
role and reach any level is their only advantage. The demihuman races have other
powers that make them entertaining to play -- particularly the ability to be
multi-classed (see <A HREF="DD01419.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01419.html">Glossary</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">). These powers balance the enjoyment of play against the ability to rise in
level. Ask your DM for the level limits imposed on nonhuman characters.
