<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Curative and healing spells have no effect on a dead character--he can only be
returned to life with a <I>raise dead</I> or <I>resurrection</I> spell (or a device that accomplishes one of these effects). Each time a
character is returned to life, the player must make a resurrection survival roll
based on his current Constitution (see <A HREF="DD01430.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01430.html">Table 3</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">). If the die roll is successful (i.e., the player rolls equal to or less than
his resurrection survival percentage), the character is restored to life in
whatever condition is specified by the spell or device.
<P></P>
 A character restored to life in this way has his Constitution permanently
lowered by 1 point. This can affect hit points previously earned. Should the
character's Constitution bonus go down, the character's hit point total is reduced by
the appropriate number of hit points (the amount of hit point bonus lost is
multiplied by the number of levels for which the character gained extra hit
points from that bonus). When the character's Constitution drops to 0, that
character can no longer be raised. He is permanently removed from play.
