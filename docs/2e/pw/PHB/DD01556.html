<TITLE>Charioteering-- Nonweapon Proficiency (Player's Handbook)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Charioteering:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A character with proficiency in this skill is able to safely guide a chariot,
over any type of terrain that can normally be negotiated, at a rate 1/3 faster
than the normal movement rate for a chariot driven by a character without this
proficiency. Note that this proficiency does not impart the ability to move a
chariot over terrain that it cannot traverse; even the best charioteer in the
world cannot take such a vehicle into the mountains.
