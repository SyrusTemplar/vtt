<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> No save is made if the target voluntarily chooses not to resist the effect of
a spell or special attack. This is the case even if the character was duped as
to the exact nature of the spell. When a character announces that he is not
resisting the spell's power, that spell (or whatever) has its full effect.
<P></P>
 The intention not to resist must be clearly stated or set up through trickery,
however. If a character is attacked by surprise or caught unawares, he is
normally allowed a saving throw. The DM can modify this saving throw, making the
chance of success worse, if the situation warrants it. Only in extreme cases of
trickery and deception should an unwitting character be denied a saving throw.
