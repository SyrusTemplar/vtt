 A <I>friends</I> spell causes the wizard to temporarily gain 2d4 points of Charisma.
Intelligent creatures within the area of effect at the time the spell is cast must make
immediate reaction checks based on the character's new Charisma. Those with
favorable reactions tend to be very impressed with the spellcaster and make an
effort to be his friends and help him, as appropriate to the situation. Officious
bureaucrats might decide to become helpful; surly gate guards might wax
informative; attacking orcs might spare the caster's life, taking him captive instead.
When the spell wears off, the creatures realize that they have been
influenced, and their reactions are determined by the DM.
<P></P>
 The components for this spell are chalk (or white flour), lampblack (or soot),
and vermilion applied to the face before casting the spell.
