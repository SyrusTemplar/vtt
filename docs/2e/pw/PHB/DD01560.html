<TITLE>Direction Sense-- Nonweapon Proficiency (Player's Handbook)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Direction Sense:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A character with this proficiency has an innate sense of direction. By
concentrating for 1d6 rounds, the character can try to determine the direction the
party is headed. If the check fails but is less than 20, the character errs by 90
degrees. If a 20 is rolled, the direction chosen is exactly opposite the true
heading. (The DM rolls the check.)
<P></P>
 Furthermore, when traveling in the wilderness, a character with direction
sense has the chance of becoming lost reduced by 5%.
