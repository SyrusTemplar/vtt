 A <I>flaming sphere</I> spell creates a burning globe of fire within 10 yards of the caster. This
sphere rolls in whichever direction the wizard points, at a rate of 30 feet per
round. It rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall, such as furniture, low
walls, etc. Flammable substances are set afire by contact with the sphere. Creatures
in contact with the globe must successfully save vs. spell or suffer 2d4
points of fire damage. Those within 5 feet of the sphere's surface must also save or
suffer 1d4 points of heat damage. A successful saving throw means no damage is
suffered. The DM may adjust the saving throws if there is little or no room to
dodge the sphere.
<P></P>
 The sphere moves as long as the spellcaster actively directs it; otherwise, it
merely stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by the same means as
any normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding
consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push
unwilling creatures aside or batter down large obstacles.
<P></P>
 The material components are a bit of tallow, a pinch of sulphur, and a dusting
of powdered iron.
