</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> In addition to the alignments above, some things--particularly unintelligent
monsters (killer plants, etc.) and animals--never bother with moral and ethical
concerns. For these creatures, alignment is simply not applicable. A dog, even
a well-trained one, is neither good nor evil, lawful nor chaotic. It is simply
a dog. For these creatures, alignment is always detected as neutral.
