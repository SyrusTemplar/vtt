<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> As important as fighting is to the AD&amp;D game, it isn't the be-all and end-all
of play. It's just one way for characters to deal with situations. If
characters could do nothing but fight, the game would quickly get boring--every
encounter would be the same. Because there is more to the game than fighting, we'll
cover much more than simple hack-and-slash combat in this chapter.
<P></P>
 In addition to explaining the basic mechanics of hitting and missing, there
are rules here for turning undead, special ways to attack and defend, poison,
heroic feats, and more.
