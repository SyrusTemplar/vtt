 A <I>spider climb</I> spell enables the recipient to climb and travel upon vertical surfaces as
well as a giant spider, or even hang upside down from ceilings. Unwilling victims
must be touched and are then allowed a saving throw vs. spell to negate the
effect. The affected creature must have bare hands and feet in order to climb in
this manner, at a movement rate of 6 (3 if at all encumbered). During the course
of the spell, the recipient cannot handle objects that weigh less than a
dagger (one pound), for such objects stick to his hands and feet. Thus, a wizard
will find it virtually impossible to cast spells if under a <I>spider climb</I> spell. Sufficient force can pull the recipient free; the DM can assign a
saving throw based on circumstances, the strength of the force, and so on. For
example, a creature with a Strength of 12 might pull the subject free if the
subject fails a saving throw vs. paralyzation (a moderately difficult saving throw).
The caster can end the spell effect with a word.
<P></P>
 The material components of this spell are a drop of bitumen and a live spider,
both of which must be eaten by the spell recipient.
