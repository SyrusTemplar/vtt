<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The basic move is to get closer for combat--i.e., move close enough to an
enemy to attack. This is neither a blind rush nor a casual stroll. Instead, the
character approaches quickly but with caution. When closing for combat, a
character can move up to half his allowed distance and still make a melee attack.
