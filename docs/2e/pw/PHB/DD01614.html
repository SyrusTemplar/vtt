<TITLE>Equipment Lists (Player's Handbook)</TITLE>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="5"><B>Equipment Lists 
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The following lists include much of the equipment your character needs for
adventuring. The most basic of these are weapons, armor, clothing, and outfitting
gear. The other lists provide goods and services your character may need during
the course of his many adventures. While most items are always available, your
DM may add to or delete from these lists. What you want may not be available
or, if your DM has set his game in a specific time period, may not have been
discovered or invented yet! While he should tell you which items are and aren't
available, you should ask if you have any doubts, particularly on large purchases.
<P></P>
 Many of the uncommon items in these lists are explained in the following pages.
<P></P>
 The price given for each item in the lists is its average price, the amount
you can expect the item to cost in a normal economy. However, large cities,
barren wildernesses, and places with brave adventurers carrying bags full of gold
are not normal economies. In these places you may find yourself paying more (very
rarely less) than the amount listed. You can also haggle with merchants over
prices, although to speed up the game it's recommended that you save this for
your important purchases. If you wind up haggling over the cost of every tankard
of ale, your character is going to spend more time being a pennypincher than an
adventurer!
