</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The initiative roll determines who acts first in any given combat round.
Initiative is not set, but changes from round to round (combat being an uncertain
thing, at best). A character never knows for certain if he will get to act before
another.
<P></P>
 Initiative is normally determined with a single roll for each side in a
conflict. This tells whether all the members of the group get to act before or after
those of the other side(s).
<P></P>
 There are also two optional methods that can be used to determine initiative.
Each of these optional methods breaks the group action down into more
individual initiatives. However, the general method of determining initiative remains
the same in all cases.
