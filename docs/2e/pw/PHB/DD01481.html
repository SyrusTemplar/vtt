</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> In the simplest version of the AD&amp;D game, clerics serve religions that can be
generally described as “good” or “evil.” Nothing more needs to be said about
it; the game will play perfectly well at this level. However, a DM who has taken
the time to create a detailed campaign world has often spent some of that time
devising elaborate pantheons, either unique creations or adaptations from
history or literature. If the option is open (and only your DM can decide), you may
want your character to adhere to a particular mythos, taking advantage of the
detail and color your DM has provided. If your character follows a particular
mythos, expect him to have abilities, spells, and restrictions different from the
generic cleric.
<P></P>
 Priesthood in any mythos must be defined in five categories: requirements,
weapons allowed, spells allowed, granted powers, and ethos.
