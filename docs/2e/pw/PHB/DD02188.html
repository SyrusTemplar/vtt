 The <I>plant growth</I> spell enables the caster to choose either of two different uses. The first
causes normal vegetation to grow, entwine, and entangle to form a thicket or
jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through at a movement rate of 10
feet per round (or 20 feet per round for larger-than-man-sized creatures). Note
that the area must have brush and trees in it in order for this spell to take
effect. Briars, bushes, creepers, lianas, roots, saplings, thistles, thorn, trees,
vines, and weeds become so thick and overgrown in the area of effect as to
form a barrier. The area of effect is a square 20 feet on a side per level of
experience of the caster, in any square or rectangular shape that the caster
decides upon at the time of the spellcasting. Thus, an 8th-level caster can affect a
maximum area of a 160-foot x 160-foot square, a 320-foot x 80-foot rectangle, a
640-foot x 40-foot rectangle, a 1,280-foot x 20-foot rectangle, etc. The
spell's effects persist in the area until it is cleared by labor, fire, or such
magical means as a <I>dispel magic</I> spell.
<P></P>
 The second use of the spell affects a one-mile square area. The DM secretly
makes a saving throw (based on the caster's level) to see if the spell takes
effect. If successful, the spell renders plants more vigorous, fruitful, and hardy,
increasing yields by 20% to 50% ([1d4+1] x 10%), given a normal growing
season. The spell does not prevent disaster in the form of floods, drought, fire, or
insects, although even in these cases the plants survive better than expected.
This effect lasts only for the life cycle of one season, the winter “death”
marking the end of a life cycle even for the sturdiest of trees. In many farming
communities, this spell is normally cast at planting time as part of the spring
festivals.
