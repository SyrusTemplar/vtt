 By calling upon his deity, the caster of a <I>spiritual hammer</I> spell brings into existence a field of force shaped vaguely like a hammer. As
long as the caster concentrates upon the hammer, it strikes at any opponent
within its range, as desired. Each round the caster can choose to attack the same
target as the previous round or switch to a new target that he can see
anywhere within his maximum range. The spiritual hammer's chance to successfully hit
is equal to that of the caster, without any Strength bonuses. In addition, it
strikes as a magical weapon with a bonus of +1 for every six experience levels
(or fraction) of the spellcaster, up to a total of +3 to the attack roll and +3
to the damage roll for a 13th-level caster. The base damage inflicted when it
scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer (1d4+1 points on
opponents of man size or smaller, or 1d4 points on larger opponents, plus the magical
bonus). The hammer strikes in the same direction as the caster is facing, so if
he is behind the target, all bonuses for rear attack are gained along with the
loss of any modifications to the target's AC for shield and Dexterity.
<P></P>
 As soon as the caster ceases concentration, the <I>spiritual hammer</I> spell ends. A <I>dispel magic</I> spell that includes either the caster or the force in its area of effect has
a chance to dispel the spiritual hammer. If an attacked creature has magic
resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the spiritual hammer strikes.
If the hammer is successfully resisted, the spell is lost. If not, the hammer
has its normal full effect for the duration of the spell.
<P></P>
 The material component of this spell is a normal war hammer that the priest
must hurl toward opponents while uttering a plea to his deity. The hammer
disappears when the spell is cast.
