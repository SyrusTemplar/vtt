</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Before a character can become a priest of a particular mythos, certain
requirements must be met. These usually involve minimum ability scores and mandatory
alignments. All priests, regardless of mythos, must have Wisdom scores of at
least 9. Beyond this, your DM can set other requirements as needed. A god of
battle, for example, should require strong, healthy priests (13 Str, 12 Con). One
whose sphere is art and beauty should demand high Wisdom and Charisma (16 or
better). Most deities demand a specific type of behavior from their followers, and
this will dictate alignment choices.
