 A <I>starshine</I> spell enables the caster to softly illuminate an area as if it were exposed
to a clear night sky filled with stars. Regardless of the height of the open
area in which the spell is cast, the area immediately beneath it is lit by
starshine. Vision ranges are the same as those for a bright moonlit night--movement
noted out to 100 yards; stationary creatures seen up to 50 yards; general
identifications made at 30 yards; and recognition at 10 yards. The spell creates
shadows and has no effect on infravision. The area of effect actually appears to be
a night sky, but disbelief of the illusion merely enables the disbeliever to
note that the “stars” are actually evoked lights. This spell does not function
under water.

 The material components are several stalks from an amaryllis plant (especially
Hypoxis) and several holly berries.
