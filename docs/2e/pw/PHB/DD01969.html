 When this spell is cast, the affected creature gains a virtual immunity to any
attack by cut, blow, projectile, or the like. Even a <I>sword of sharpness</I> cannot affect a creature protected by <I>stoneskin,</I> nor can a rock hurled by a giant, a snake's strike, etc. However, magical
attacks from such spells as <I>fireball, magic missile, lightning bolt,</I> and so forth have their normal effects. The spell's effects are not
cumulative with multiple castings.
<P></P>
 The spell blocks 1d4 attacks, plus one attack per two levels of experience the
caster has achieved. This limit applies regardless of attack rolls and
regardless of whether the attack was physical or magical. For example, a <I>stoneskin</I> spell cast by a 9th-level wizard would protect against from five to eight
attacks. An attacking griffon would reduce the protection by three each round;
four magic missiles would count as four attacks in addition to inflicting their
normal damage.
<P></P>
 The material components of the spell are granite and diamond dust sprinkled on
the recipient's skin.
