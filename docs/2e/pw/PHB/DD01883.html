 A <I>pyrotechnics</I> spell draws on an existing fire source to produce one of two effects, at the
option of the caster. First, it can produce a flashing and fiery burst of
glowing, colored aerial fireworks that lasts one round. This effect temporarily
blinds those creatures in, under, or within 120 feet of the area and that have an
unobstructed line of sight to the burst. Creatures viewing this are blinded for
1d4+1 rounds unless they successfully save vs. spell. The fireworks fill a
volume 10 times greater than that of the original fire source.
<P></P>
 This spell can also cause a thick, writhing stream of smoke to arise from the
source and form a choking cloud that lasts for one round per experience level
of the caster. This covers a roughly spherical volume from the ground or floor
up (or conforming to the shape of a confined area) that totally obscures vision
beyond 2 feet. The smoke fills a volume 100 times that of the fire source. All
within the cloud must roll successful saving throws vs. spell or suffer -2
penalties to all combat rolls and Armor Class.
<P></P>
 The spell uses one fire source within a 20-foot cube, which is immediately
extinguished. An extremely large fire used as a source might be only partially
extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature
(such as a fire elemental) used as a source suffers 1 point of damage per caster
level.
