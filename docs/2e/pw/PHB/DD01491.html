</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Unlike the cleric, the druid is allowed to use only “natural” armors --
padded, hide, or leather armor and wooden shields, including those with magical
enhancements. All other armors are forbidden to him. His weapons are limited to
club, sickle, dart, spear, dagger, scimitar, sling, and staff.
