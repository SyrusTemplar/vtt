 This spell aids in locating a known or familiar object. The wizard casts the
spell, slowly turns, and senses when he is facing in the direction of the object
to be located, provided the object is within range (i.e., 60 yards for
3rd-level wizards, 80 yards for 4th, 100 yards for 5th, etc.). The spell can locate
such objects as apparel, jewelry, furniture, tools, weapons, or even a ladder or
stairway. Note that attempting to find a specific item, such as jewelry or a
crown, requires an accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the
actual, the spell does not work. Desired but unique objects cannot be located
by this spell unless they are known by the caster. The spell is blocked by
lead. Creatures cannot be found by this spell.
<P></P>
 The material component is a forked twig.
<P></P>
 The reversal, <I>obscure object</I>, hides an object from location by spell, crystal ball, or similar means for
eight hours. Creatures cannot be affected by this spell. The material component
is a chameleon skin.
