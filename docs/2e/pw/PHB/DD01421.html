To venture into the worlds of the AD&amp;D game, you first need to create a <I>character.</I> The character you create is your alter ego in the fantasy realms of this
game, a make-believe person who is under your control and through whom you
vicariously explore the world the Dungeon Master (DM) has created.
<P></P>
 Each character in the AD&amp;D game has six abilities: Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. The first three abilities represent
the physical nature of the character, while the second three quantify his
mental and personality traits.
<P></P>
 In various places throughout these rules, the following abbreviations are used
for the ability names: Strength--Str; Dexterity--Dex; Constitution--Con;
Intelligence--Int; Wisdom--Wis; Charisma--Cha.
