<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This is the god of adventure (and misadventure), a favorite among halfling
adventurers (especially thieves). He has a bawdy sense of humor and little sense
of propriety. Brandobaris is always ready with a joke or a jug, yet he is such a
friendly rapscallion that he rarely makes an enemy. He is a good friend of
Garl Glittergold and Baervan Wildwanderer.

 Avatar: In avatar form Brandobaris appears as a plump and jolly halfling. He's
always very well-dressed and ready with a smart reply to any attempt at
conversation.
