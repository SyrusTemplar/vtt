 As already noted, halflings prefer to avoid war if at all possible. A
community of the small folk will be willing to negotiate extensively, and even yield to
a certain amount of extortion, in order to avoid bloodshed.
<P></P>
 However, when pressed to the point of no return, halfling troops make
determined fighters with a number of effective tactics at their command. In most cases,
only about half the adults will fight, the remainder remaining behind to
protect the elderly and children. In cases of dire need--where the very survival of
the community is at stake--every able-bodied adult may well be drafted into the
cause.
<P></P>
 Halflings have a reputation for being easy-going and somewhat lazy, but this
does not mean they cannot fight effectively if they need to--the legends of the
Bad Old Days remind every halfling of what life was like before they had
villages and lands of their own, and they will fight with surprising tenacity, even
ferocity, to keep from slipping back into that fugitive existence. Thus each
halfling has something that can be used as a weapon in his or her burrow, no
matter how peaceful the area. If the village has had to fight in the recent past,
then each resident might have a short sword and shield as well as a bow and
arrows or a sling and bullets. Even if battle is rare or virtually nonexistant,
villagers will be able to arm themselves with a missile weapon apiece (bow, sling,
or perhaps darts) and at least a long knife or spear for melee combat--a fact
invaders expecting to find them easy prey have discovered time and again, to
their surprise and regret.
<P></P>
 Halfling companies are almost always irregular--i.e., they don't fight in neat
ranks and lines. They will be quite capable of firing volleys of missile fire
upon command, and they will advance and withdraw on the orders of their
captains--but they would have a hard time facing, for example, a tight rank of armored
human infantry or orcish swords.
<P></P>
 Instead, the halflings favor battles in wooded or otherwise obstructed
terrain. Their scattered formation is ideal for each fighter finding his or her own
source of cover, though they are far more adept than humans at holding their
company's unity even in thickets where visibility and mobility are severely
limited. The fabled ability of halflings to virtually disappear in underbrush is never
more useful than at moments like this.
<P></P>
 A favored tactic of a halfling force, when fighting in this type of concealing
terrain, is to create a loud diversion. A few veteran warriors will thrash
through the brush, firing many arrows, giving the impression that they number
scores of times more than they actually do. Then, if the opponent's force turns to
face this imaginary onslaught, the real halfling company screened by the woods
attacks the enemy's flank.
<P></P>
 If a halfling force is attacked in unfavorable (i.e., open) terrain by a force
of large creatures, the small folk might try to stand off the attack if they
feel they have a chance of success. If they are attacked by horsemen or are
out-numbered by well-armored infantry, however, the entire formation will usually
scatter, joining up again at a place offering more concealment and protection.
<P></P>
 Halflings rarely fight mounted, though Tallfellows are a notable exception,
occasionally riding into battle on small ponies or, very rarely, beasts such as
dire wolves. When halflings fight as members of an alliance, they are often used
as missile troops. Well-screened behind formations of human or dwarven
foot-soldiers, halfling archers and slingers can shower the enemy with a deadly rain
of arrows and bullets.
<P></P>
 Another common specialty of halfling troops is tunneling and underground
operations. They are not particularly adept at digging such passages--that task is
better left to dwarves--but halfling troops can negotiate much smaller passages
than can most of their allies. Thus, if combat is expected in close quarters or
beneath a low ceiling, halfling troops are often selected to lead the way.
