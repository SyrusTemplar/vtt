 Each kit begins with a general description of the character type, including
any background requirements that might be necessary. Following this, additional
information is organized into these categories:
<P></P>
 Roads to Adventure: This category, unique to the halfling kits, suggests
several reasons why the character might be motivated to do such a rash thing as
leave his or her hearth and burrow for a life on the road.
<P></P>
 Role: The specific functions of this character within halfling society and
beyond.
<P></P>
 Secondary Skills: In a campaign that uses the secondary skills rules from the
AD&amp;D- Second Edition game, taking a particular kit might require the character
to take a specific secondary skill.
<P></P>
 Weapon Proficiencies: The listed proficiencies must be among those taken by a
halfling character at first level. Unless the entry specifically states
otherwise, they do not increase the number of proficiencies available but must be
taken out of the standard allotment of slots.
<P></P>
 Bonus Nonweapon Proficiencies: A halfling character using a kit gains these
proficiencies free--the PC is not required to spend a slot for any of them.
<P></P>
 Recommended Nonweapon Proficiencies: These proficiencies are not required of
the character, but they do match up well with the kit. They require normal
nonweapon proficiency slots be expended for each one.
<P></P>
 Thieving Skill Emphasis: (For thief and fighter/thief characters only.) The
AD&amp;D- Second Edition thief rules allow considerable flexibility in a character's
selection of thieving abilities. A character may wish to specialize in the
stealth-related skills such as Move Silently and Hide in Shadows if he or she is a
spy or cat burglar. A thief who needs to survive on city streets might prefer
improved scores in Pick Pockets and Open Locks. This entry lists appropriate
skills for each kit. They are not mandatory, nor do they grant any bonuses or
confer any penalties beyond what they would grant any thief character.
<P></P>
 Equipment: Any special equipment needs of the character are detailed here.
<P></P>
 Special Benefits: These are things a character can do (or protections he or
she gains) because of the kit.
<P></P>
 Special Hindrances: These are limitations placed upon the character by the kit.
