 It should be noted that, so far as halflings themselves are concerned, the
name &quot;halfling&quot; is a misnomer. They don't consider themselves half the size of
anything; in their opinion, it's everybody else who's oversized. Their own name
for their race translates simply as 'the folk' or 'the small folk' (a term which
sometimes includes gnomes as well); humans, elves, and dwarves are collectively
referred to as 'the Big Folk.' The halflings also have a slang term they use
to refer to humans which translates as 'too-talls.'
