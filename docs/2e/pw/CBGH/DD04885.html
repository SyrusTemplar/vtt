 This goddess is the overseer of many of the mundane and day-to-day aspects of
halfling life, chiefly concerned with the burrow and the hearth; again, some
believe her to be a persona of Yondalla rather than a separate entity. Friendship
among her worshippers is considered the highest praise one can raise to her
name; she is most displeased with those who fail to display proper hospitality
and good fellowship.

 Avatar: Cyrrollalee often takes the form of a stooped halfling of
indeterminate years, worn by poverty and work into a frail shell. In this guise, she often
visits halfling burrows to see if the inhabitants are truly hospitable; woe to
the family that turns her away!
