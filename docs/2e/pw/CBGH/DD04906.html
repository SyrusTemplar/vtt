 Halflings are a folk who can derive pleasure from many simple things and are
not afraid to show it--a halfling who is happy laughs; one who feels affection
or love will express himself or herself with words or deeds.
<P></P>
 The small folk love to tell and hear stories and will generally be attentive
and silent when anyone spins a tale. Not surprisingly, they especially love
stories in which the small and clever triumph over those who are physically larger
and stronger but clumsier and less quick-witted.
<P></P>
 Halflings also have a frank appreciation for bawdy humor and practical jokes.
They have the ability to laugh at themselves, though one prank often leads to
another in retaliation, and so on. Such good-natured exchanges have been known
to continue, reciprocated back and forth, for decade after decade.
