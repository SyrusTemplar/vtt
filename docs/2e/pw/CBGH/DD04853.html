   More than a medium of wealth, gems are cherished to a degree difficult for
non-gnomes to comprehend. Every gnome has a small gem he or she will carry at all
times, often feeling or stroking it when thoughtful or troubled. Every gnomish
village will have a few particularly splendid stones that belong to the
community as a whole, each with an accompanying legend, and enchanted gems are the
favorite magical items of gnomish spellcasters.
