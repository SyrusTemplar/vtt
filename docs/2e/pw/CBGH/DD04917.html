 An Archer is a halfling warrior who devotes nearly all of his or her time and
energy to the development of skill with a missile weapon. &quot;Archer&quot; is the
generic name for this kit: a &quot;slinger&quot; version of the kit also exists and is nearly
as popular as the Archer itself, while halflings who live in jungle regions
(like the wild halflings of Athas) have developed a blowgun variant. In those rare
campaigns where firearms are allowed, this kit can be used to create a
halfling sharpshooter (assuming the firearms are small enough for a halfling to wield;
i.e., muskets rather than arquebuses).
<P></P>
 An Archer must have a Dexterity score of at least 15.
<P></P>
 Often an Archer comes from a background as a hunter, though membership in the
local militia is another possible avenue into the kit.
<P></P>
 Roads to Adventure: Archers are likely to be drawn into adventure for several
reasons. The challenge of competition is strong--the best Archer in the village
will naturally be tempted to test his or her skill against small folk, other
demihumans, and human archers. Because their skill is so easily measurable,
halfling Archers are particularly susceptible to this urge to go out and test their
abilities against the toughest competition they can find. Alternately, a
halfling Archer may be vigorously recruited by other adventurers who recognize the
value of a skilled bowman.
<P></P>
 Also, the Archer's skill helps to make him or her an accomplished hunter, and
many an adventure can begin during a long stalk through the trackless forest.
At the same time, his or her likely status as a prominent member of the
village's defense militia makes the archer a likely candidate for any rescue party or
guard duty that might develop.
<P></P>
 Role: The Archer is a respected figure among a race where missile skill is the
norm--he or she is the best of the best. In a small village he or she will be
one of the primary hunters. Archers work well with Forestwalkers; it is often
the Archer's task to bring down the game the Forestwalker has tracked.
<P></P>
 The Archer also forms a staunch pillar of the community defense force--often,
a skilled Archer will be placed in command of a company of halfling bowmen.
<P></P>
 Secondary Skills: An Archer should have the Bowyer/Fletcher secondary skill.
<P></P>
 Weapon Proficiencies: Three of the Archer's initial weapons proficiency slots
must be used for missile weapons. If the weapons specialization optional rules
are used, the Archer can specialize in one chosen missile weapon by expending
two (not three, as is the norm) slots for the weapon of specialization.
<P></P>
 Bonus Non-Weapon Proficiencies: All Archers automatically receive the
Bowyer/Fletcher proficiency.
<P></P>
 Recommended Non-Weapon Proficiencies: The character should consider taking
Hunting, Firebuilding, Tracking, and Weather Sense.
<P></P>
 Equipment: The Archer's most essential piece of equipment is his or her bow or
sling. At the start of his or her career this is likely to be a non-magical
(although well-made) weapon, but throughout his or her adventures the character
will continually search for the perfect bow. All Archers carry a plentiful
supply of ammunition--usually at least twice the usual quiverfull of arrows.
<P></P>
 As often as not, halflings with this kit will collect a variety of special
missile types for use in special situations. For example, an Archer might have a
few blunt-headed arrows (for stunning, rather than killing, targets), barbed
arrows with thin lines attached (enabling him or her to retrieve small game simply
by reeling in the string after a hit) and fire arrows (extra-long arrows with
rags wrapped around their heads; when soaked with oil and ignited, these
missiles fly half the distance of regular arrows but have an excellent chance to
ignite any flammable substance that they strike). A slinger will likewise have a
selection of special sling bullets--some spiked, others hollow and filled with
skunk oil, sleeping gas, or a number of other noxious substances.
<P></P>
 Special Benefits: The Archer can choose to make a <I>called shot</I>, earning additional bonuses on his or her missile attacks in certain
circumstances. By electing to take careful aim, he or she gains a +2 bonus on his or
her attack roll for that arrow. However, this requires that he or she forgo
initiative (i.e., the shot must be the last act of a melee round). Also, the Archer
must concentrate on the shot, meaning he or she can only make one shot that
round. Finally, any successful attack against the Archer will naturally break his
or her concentration and cause the benefit to be lost, although in this case
the shot still has a normal chance to hit. The +2 bonus is in addition to any
other attack bonuses the character might have due to Dexterity, weapon
specialization, <I>bless</I> spells, or magical weaponry. 
<P></P>
 In outdoor melee, the same procedure (single shot; <I>last</I> act in the round) can be used to increase the range of the shot instead of
gaining the attack bonus (i.e., the Archer can choose to make a called shot with
increased accuracy or extended range, but not both at the same time). The extra
range is equal to the weapon's medium range added to the long range; the
attack is modified with the long range penalty to hit.
<P></P>
 Special Hindrances: The Archer can gain normal proficiency in only one melee
weapon. He or she can spend proficiency slots on others but will always wield
them with a  -1 penalty on all attack rolls. For example, suppose Willem the
Archer learns to use a short sword as well as his bow, sling, and throwing knives.
If he later decides to use a proficiency for hand-to-hand knife-fighting, he
can do so (assuming he has the proficiency slot to spare) but he will suffer a 
-1 penalty on his melee attack rolls with the knife.
