 This is a dirty-under-the fingernails halfling with an unusual amount of
courage and a scrappy attitude toward dangerous and powerful foes. The cheerful,
matter-of-fact, bloodthirsty attitude of these professionals usually comes as a
great surprise to humans and others who think of all halflings as jolly
farmer-types. The Tunnelrat specializes in underground search-and-destroy missions,
especially in areas where constricted space or low ceilings would put larger
warriors at a significant disadvantage.
<P></P>
 The Tunnelrat must have a Strength score of at least 13 and a Constitution
score of 11 or greater.
<P></P>
 Roads to Adventure: Most Tunnelrats are drawn to this deadly calling by some
dire event in the past--usually nothing less than a life-shattering trauma will
suffice to drive a normally peaceful halfling into such gritty and dangerous
work, as when a halfling who has lost loved ones to the depredations of goblins
or kobolds becomes an implacable enemy to those evil creatures. Occasionally, of
course, the drive is not due to such dark causes--the lure of easy money,
simple talent, or mental instability might propel a sturdy halfling into a career
as a Tunnelrat. After all, this is one of the few areas (perhaps the only one)
where small size is not only not a liability but a basic prerequisite.
<P></P>
 Role: The Tunnelrat specializes in rooting out smallish humanoid monsters who
make their lairs underground. Goblins, Duergar and kobolds are the most common
of these enemies, though many other types are possible--including lycanthropes,
undead, and animal monsters like giant rats, giant weasels, and carrion
crawlers.
<P></P>
 Tunnelrats generally seek out the dens of their enemies, attacking them for
whatever profit they can find there--and, more importantly, for the satisfaction
of eliminating an enemy of their people. Tunnelrats sometimes work together as
a team and will sometimes band together with gnomish Goblinstickers on a joint
mission, especially if the two groups share the same foe. In the latter case,
the gnomish presence provides a very useful complement to the halflings--without
any increase in size. Tunnelrats will sometimes join forces with dwarves as
well, but since a typical dwarf is significantly larger than a gnome or halfling,
this severely restricts the size of tunnels that the party can investigate.
<P></P>
 Secondary Skills: No particular secondary skill is required for the Tunnelrat.
<P></P>
 Weapon Proficiencies: The Tunnelrat should be proficient in the use of the
short sword, hand axe, or war hammer, as well as either the crossbow, short bow,
blowgun, or darts. If weapon specialization is used in the campaign, the
Tunnelrat must have a melee weapon specialization by the time he or she reaches third
level.
<P></P>
 Bonus Nonweapon Proficiencies: The Tunnelrat automatically receives
Blindfighting in addition to any other proficiency. Also, he or she can select one of the
following languages in addition to any the character would normally know:
goblin, orc, kobold, and Duergar.
<P></P>
 Recommended Nonweapon Proficiencies: Rope Use, Swimming, and Mountaineering
(for scaling underground cliffs) are all useful to the Tunnelrat.
<P></P>
 Equipment: The Tunnelrat is typically equipped with a generous coil of thin
but strong rope, flasks of oil, flint and steel, at least one lantern, and metal
climbing spikes. His or her weapons will be slung from belts and straps,
readily reachable with either hand. Also, he or she will be sure to carry a plentiful
supply of ammunition for his or her missile weapon.
<P></P>
 Special Benefits: Tunnelrats who are not Stoutish will gradually develop an
infravision-like ability to see in the dark. The range of this sight (which works
exactly like infravision) is equal to 10' per level of the Tunnelrat (to a
maximum of 60').
<P></P>
 Special Hindrances: Tunnelrats are considered shockingly crude and more than a
little mad by most other halflings--why would anyone <I>choose</I> to root around in dirty holes after dangerous monsters? Therefore, the
Tunnelrat suffers a  -2 penalty on Reaction Checks made for NPC halflings.
