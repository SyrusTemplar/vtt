<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ring of Water Walking:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This ring enables the wearer to walk on any liquid without sinking into
it—this includes mud, quicksand, oil, running water, and even snow. Up to 1,200
pounds can be supported by a <I>ring of water walking.</I> The ring wearer's feet do not actually contact the surface he is walking upon
(but oval depressions about 1½ inches deep per 100 pounds of weight of the
walker will be observed in hardening mud or set snow). The wearer moves at his
standard movement rate.
