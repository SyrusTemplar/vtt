<TITLE>Helm of Teleportation-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Helm of Teleportation:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This is another helmet of normal appearance which will give off a magical aura
if detected for. Any character wearing this device may <I>teleport</I> once per day, exactly as if he were a wizard—the destination must be known,
and a risk is involved. If the wearer is a wizard, the helm's full powers can be
employed, for the wearer can then memorize a <I>teleportation</I> spell, and use the helm to refresh his memory so he can repeat the spell up
to three times upon objects or characters and still be able to personally <I>teleport</I> by means of the helm. As long as the wizard retains the <I>teleportation</I> spell uncast, he can personally <I>teleport</I> up to six times before the memory of the spell is lost, and even then a usage
of the helm remains as noted above for all characters.
