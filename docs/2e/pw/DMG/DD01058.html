<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Stone of Weight (Loadstone):</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This magical stone appears to be any one of the other sorts, and testing will
not reveal its nature. However, as soon as the possessor of a <I>stone of weight</I> is in a situation where he is required to move quickly in order to avoid an
enemy—combat or pursuit—the item causes a 50% reduction in movement, and even
attacks are reduced to 50% normal rate. Furthermore, the stone cannot be gotten
rid of by any nonmagical means—if it is thrown away or smashed, it will reappear
somewhere on the character's person. If a <I>dispel evil</I> is cast upon a <I>loadstone,</I> the item will disappear and no longer haunt the individual.
