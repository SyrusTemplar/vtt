 While ornamentation has no effect on the function of an item, it does increase
the cost. Ornamented items can also enhance the status of the owner as a man
of wealth and influence. Of course, it also marks the character as a target for
thieves and robbers.
<P></P>
 Among the more popular types of ornamentation are jeweled mountings,
engraving, embossing, inlaying, painting, plating, chiseling, chasing, etching,
enameling, lacquering, carving, and gilding. Common items also can be made from rare
and fantastic materials--perhaps as simple as silk or the wonderfully rare and
incredibly supple hides of baby dragons. The cost of such items depends on the
difficulty and skill of the work. It is best for you to decide a price (highly
inflated over the original), although 10 times the normal cost can be used as a
starting figure.
