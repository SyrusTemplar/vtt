 A second, more insidious, type of magical item is the one that changes a
character's alignment. Unlike the usual, gradual methods by which a character
changes alignment, magical alignment changes are instantaneous. The character's
personality undergoes an immediate transformation, something like magical
brainwashing. Depending on the new alignment, the change may or may not be immediately
noticeable. However, you should insist that the player role-play his new
situation. Do not allow him to ignore the effects the alignment change will have on his
character's personality. Indeed, good role-players will take this as an
opportunity to stretch their skills.
