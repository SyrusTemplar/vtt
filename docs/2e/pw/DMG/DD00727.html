<TITLE>Invulnerability-- Potion (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Invulnerability:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This potion confers immunity to nonmagical weapons. It also protects against
attacks from creatures (not characters) with no magical properties or with fewer
than 4 Hit Dice. Thus, an 8th-level character without a magical weapon could
not harm the imbiber of an invulnerability potion.
<P></P>
 The potion also improves Armor Class rating by 2 classes and gives a bonus of
+2 to the individual on his saving throws versus all forms of attack. Its
effects are realized only when the entire potion is consumed, and they last for 5d4
rounds. Only warriors can use this potion.
