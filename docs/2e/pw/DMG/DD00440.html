 Bows, crossbows, and many other missile weapons have different rates of fire
(ROF)--the number of missiles they can shoot in a single round.
<P></P>
 Small, light weapons can be thrown very quickly, so up to three daggers can be
thrown in a single round. Arrows can be nocked and let loose almost as
quickly, so up to two shots can be fired in a single round.
<P></P>
 Some weapons (such as heavy crossbows) take a long time to load and can be
fired only every other round.
<P></P>
 Whatever the ROF, multiple missile shots are handled the same way as other
multiple attacks for the purposes of determining initiative. The ROF of each
missile weapon is listed in<A HREF="../PHB/DD01625.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01625.html"> Table 45: Missile Weapon Ranges (and Rates of Fire</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> in the<I> Player's Handbook</I>.
