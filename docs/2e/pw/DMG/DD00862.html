<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Wand of Paralyzation: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This wand shoots forth a thin ray of bluish color to a maximum range of 60
feet. Any creature touched by the ray must roll successful saving throw vs. wand
or be rendered rigidly immobile for 5d4 rounds. A save indicates the ray missed,
and there is no effect. As soon as the ray touches one creature, it stops—the
wand can attack only one target per round. The wand has an initiative modifier
of +3 , and each use costs one charge. The wand may operate once per round. It
may be recharged.
