<TITLE>Stone of Good Luck (Luckstone)-- Magical Item (DMG)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Stone of Good Luck (Luckstone):</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This magical stone is typically a bit of rough polished agate or similar
mineral. Its possessor gains a +1 (+5% where applicable) on all dice rolls involving
factors such as saving, slipping, dodging, etc.—whenever dice are rolled to
find whether the character suffers from some adverse happening. This luck does
not affect attack and damage rolls or spell failure dice.
<P></P>
 Additionally, the <I>luckstone</I> gives the possessor a +/- 1% to 10% (at owner's option) on rolls for
determination of magical items or diversion of treasure. The most favorable results
will always be gained with a <I>stone of good luck.</I>
