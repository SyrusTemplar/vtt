<TITLE>Broom of Animated Attack-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Broom of Animated Attack:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This is indistinguishable from a normal broom, except by means of detection of
its magic. It is identical to a <I>broom of flying</I> by all tests short of attempted use. Using it reveals that a <I>broom of animated attack</I> is a very nasty item:
<P></P>
 If a command word (&quot;fly,'' &quot;soar,'' etc.) is spoken, the broom will do a
loop-the-loop with its hopeful rider, dumping him on his head from 1d4 + 5 feet off
the ground. The broom will then attack the stunned victim, swatting the face
with the straw/twig end to blind and beating with the handle end.
<P></P>
 The broom gets two attacks per round with each end (two swats with the straw,
two with the handle). It attacks as if it were a 4-Hit-Dice monster. The straw
end causes blindness for one round if it hits. The other end causes 1d3 points
of damage when it hits. The broom is Armor Class 7 and takes 18 hit points to
destroy.
