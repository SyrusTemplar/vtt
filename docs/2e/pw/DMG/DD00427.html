 There are times when a character wants to defeat another being without killing
it. A companion may have been charmed into attacking his friends (and his
friends don't want to kill him); an enemy could have information the PCs can get
only by subduing him; characters might simply see the monetary value of bringing
back a live monster. Whatever the case, sooner or later characters are going to
try to defeat something without striking a fatal blow.
<P></P>
 There are three types of non-lethal attacks--punching, wrestling, and
overbearing. Punching is basic bare-fisted fighting. Wrestling is the classic
combination of grappling, holds, and throws. Overbearing is simply trying to pull down
an opponent by sheer mass or weight of numbers, pinning him to the ground.
