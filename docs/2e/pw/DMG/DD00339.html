 First, whenever a character attains a new spell level, allow the player one
new spell immediately. You can choose this spell, let the player choose it, or
select it randomly.
<P></P>
 The rationale behind this is simple: All the long hours of study and reading
the character has been doing finally jells into something real and
understandable. 
<P></P>
 No roll is needed to learn this spell, unless you allow the character to
choose it. If the character is a specialist in a school of magic, the new spell
should be from that school--if there is a spell available.
