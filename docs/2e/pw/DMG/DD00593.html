 As the henchman is played, it is the player's responsibility to keep track of
any information about the henchman that isn't kept secret. Not only does this
make running the game a small bit easier for the DM, it forces the player to pay
attention to his henchman.
<P></P>
 Among the things a player should keep track of is a henchman's experience
point total. Henchmen do earn experience points from adventures and can advance in
level. However, since they are not full player characters, they only earn half
the experience a character would normally get.
<P></P>
 They also expect their fair share of treasure and magical items
discovered—more, if they took a significant risk. They expect the same care and attention the
player character receives when they are injured or killed. Indeed it is
possible for a forsaken henchman to return as a vengeful spirit to wreak havoc on
those who abandoned him!
