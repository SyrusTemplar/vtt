<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Talisman of Pure Good:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A high priest who possesses this item can cause a flaming crack to open at the
feet of an evil priest. The intended victim will be swallowed up forever and
sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the talisman must be
good, and if he is not exceptionally pure in thought and deed, the evil priest
will gain a saving throw vs. death.
<P></P>
 A <I>talisman of pure good</I> has seven charges. It cannot be recharged. If a neutral priest touches one of
these magic stones, he will suffer 7d4 points of damage. If an evil priest
touches one, he will suffer 12d4 points of damage. Nonpriests will not be affected
by the device.
