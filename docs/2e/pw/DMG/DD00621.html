 Sooner or later characters wind up blundering around in the dark. Normally
they try to avoid this, but clever DMs and foolish players generally manage to
bring it about. Perhaps the kobolds captured the player characters an stripped
them of all their gear; perhaps the characters forgot to bring enough torches.
Whatever the reason, those without infravision suffer both physical and
psychological effects in the dark.
<P></P>
 For the purposes of this discussion, &quot;darkness'' means any time the characters
suffer from limited visibility. Thus, the rules given here apply equally well
when the characters are affected by a darkness spell, blundering about in
pea-soup fog, out on a moonless night, or even blindfolded.
<P></P>
 Since one can't see anything in the dark, the safe movement rate of blinded
characters is immediately slowed by 1/3 the normal amount. Faster movement
requires a Dexterity check (see <A HREF="DD00625.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00625.html">Chapter 14</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> : Time and Movement). Characters also suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls and
saving throws. Their Armor Class is four worse than normal (to a limit of 10).
Sight-related damage bonuses (backstabbing, etc.) are negated. However,
darkness is not always absolute, and those DMs who wish to make distinctions between
various levels of darkness can use <A HREF="DD00622.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00622.html">Table 72</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> .
