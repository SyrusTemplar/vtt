</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Horn of the Tritons:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This device is a conch shell horn which can be blown once per day (except by a
triton who can sound it three times daily). A <I>horn of the tritons</I> can do any one of the following functions when blown:
<P></P>
1. Calm rough waters in a one mile radius. (This has the effect of dispelling a
water 
<P></P>
 elemental or water weird.)
<P></P>
2. Summon 5d4 hippocampi (on a d6 roll of 1 or 2), 5d6 giant sea horses (on a
roll of 
<P></P>
 3-5), or 1d10 sea lions (on a roll of 6) if the character is in a body of
water in 
<P></P>
 which such creatures dwell. The creatures summoned will be friendly and will 
<P></P>
 obey, to the best of their understanding, the character who sounded the horn.
<P></P>
3. Panic marine creatures with animal or lower Intelligence, causing them to flee 
<P></P>
 unless each saves vs. spell. Those who do save must take a -5 penalty on their 
<P></P>
 attack rolls for 3d6 turns (30-180 rounds).
<P></P>
 Any sounding of a <I>horn of the tritons</I> can be heard by all tritons within a three-mile radius.
<P></P>
