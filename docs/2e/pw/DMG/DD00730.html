<TITLE>Oil of Acid Resistance-- Potion (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Oil of Acid Resistance:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">When this oil is applied to skin, cloth, or any other material, it confers
virtual invulnerability against acid. The oil wears off, but slowly—one
application lasts for a whole day (1440 rounds). Each time the protected material is
exposed to acid, the duration of the oil is reduced by as many rounds as hit points
of damage the acid would have caused to exposed flesh. Thus, if a black dragon
breathes for 64 points of acid damage, a person protected by this oil would
lose 1 hour and 4 minutes of protection (64 rounds—32 if a saving throw vs.
breath weapon was successful).
<P></P>
 Each flask contains sufficient oil to protect one man-sized creature (and
equipment) for 24 hours; or to protect any combination of creatures and duration
between these extremes.
