sleep, and going without food and drink for up to seven days. It will nullify up to
seven days of deprivation, and will continue in effect for the remainder of its
seven-day duration. The potion also makes the user proof against poison and
disease while it is in effect, and the user will recover lost hit points at the
rate of 1 every 4 hours.
