<TITLE>Philter of Stammering and Stuttering-- Potion (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Philter of Stammering and Stuttering</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B>:</B> When this liquid is consumed, it will seem to be beneficial—<I>philter of glibness</I> or <I>persuasiveness,</I> for instance. However, whenever a meaningful utterance must be spoken (the
verbal component of a spell, the text of a scroll, negotiation with a monster,
etc.), the potion's true effect is revealed—nothing can be said properly, and the
reactions of all creatures hearing such nonsense will be at a -5 penalty.
