<TITLE>Bag of Transmuting-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Bag of Transmuting:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This magical sack appears to be a <I>bag of holding</I> of one of the four sizes described above. It will perform properly for 1d4 +
1 uses (or more if the usages are made within a few days' time). At some point,
however, the magical field will waver, and metals and gems stored in the bag
will be turned into common metals and stones of no worth.
<P></P>
 When emptied, the bag pours forth these transmuted metals and minerals. Any
magical items (other than artifacts and relics) placed in the bag will become
ordinary lead, glass, or wood as appropriate (no saving throw) once the
transmuting effects have begun.
