 For all his good intentions, sooner or later the DM is likely to err in the
awarding of treasure. Either he will award too little or hand out too much. The
first is just tight-fistedness; the second leads to high-powered,
low-role-playing campaigns (sometimes called &quot;Monty Haul'' dungeons).

 Now, if both DM and players enjoy a particular type of campaign and are having
a good time, there is no problem to fix. However, more often than not, these
two extreme adventuring styles lead to game problems.
