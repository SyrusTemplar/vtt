<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Oil of Disenchantment:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This oil enables the removal of all enchantments and charms placed upon living
things, and the suppression of such effects on objects. If the oil is rubbed
in a creature, all enchantments and charms on it are immediately removed. If
rubbed onto objects bearing an enchantment, the magic will be lost for 1d10 + 20
turns. After this time, the oil loses potency and the item regains its
enchantment. The oil does not radiate magic once it is applied, and masks the
enchantment of whatever it coats, so that an item so coated will not show any enchantment
for as long as the oil remains effective.
