<TITLE>Nolzur's Marvelous Pigments-- Magical Item (DMG)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Nolzur's Marvelous Pigments:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">These magical emulsions enable their possessor to create actual objects simply
by depicting their form in two dimensions. The pigments are applied by a stick
tipped with bristles, hair, or fur. The emulsion flows from the application to
form the desired object as the wielder concentrates on the desired image. One
pot of <I>Nolzur's marvelous pigments</I> is sufficient to create a 1,000-cubic-foot object by depicting it
two-dimensionally over a 100-square-foot surface. Thus, a 10-foot by 10-foot rendition of
a pit would result in an actual 10-foot by 10-foot by 10-foot pit; a 10-foot by
10-foot depiction of a room would result in a 10-foot by 10-foot by 10-foot
room; and so on.
<P></P>
 Only normal, inanimate things can be created—doors, pits, flowers, trees,
cells, etc.; monsters, people, golems, and the like can't be created. The pigments
must be applied to a surface (i.e., a floor, wall, ceiling, door, etc.). From
1d4 containers of pigments will be found, usually with a single instrument about
1 foot long with which to apply them. It takes one turn to depict an object
with pigments. Objects of value depicted by pigments—precious metals, gems,
jewelry, ivory, etc.—will appear to be valuable but will really be made of tin,
lead, paste gems, brass, bone, etc. Normal armor or weapons can, of course, be
created.
