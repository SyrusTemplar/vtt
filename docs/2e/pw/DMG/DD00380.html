 The prowess of player characters is measured in levels. Levels are earned
through the accumulation of experience points. A separate table for each character
group (shown in <A HREF="../PHB/DD01456.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01456.html">Chapter 3</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>) tells how many experience points characters of that group need to attain
each level.
<P></P>
 When a character earns enough experience to attain the next level for his
character class, he immediately gains several benefits (unless the optional rules
for training are used). The character gains an additional die of hit points, or
a set number of hit points at higher levels. These are added to both his
current total and his maximum number of hit points. The character may or may not
improve in other abilities, including combat and saving throws, dependent upon his
character class.
