<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Potions are typically found in ceramic, crystal, glass, or metal flasks or
vials (though you can change this, if you want). Flasks or other containers
generally contain enough fluid to provide one person with one complete dose to
achieve the effects described for each potion below.
<P></P>
 Opening and drinking a potion has an initiative modifier of 1, but the potion
doesn't take effect until an additional initiative modifier delay of 1d4+1 has
passed. Only then do the full magical properties of the potion become evident.
Magical oils are poured over the body and smeared appropriately; this imposes a
speed factor delay of 1d4 + 1.
<P></P>
 Potions can be compounded by mages at relatively low cost. However, they must
have a sample of the desired potion to obtain the right formula. Furthermore,
ingredients tend to be rare or hard to come by. This aspect of potions, as well
as the formulation of new ones by players, is detailed in the Spell Research
rules.
