 Asking another character &quot;So, what's your alignment?&quot; is a rude question. At
best, any character who is boorish enough to bring up the issue is likely to
receive a very icy stare (turning to shocked horror from more refined characters).
<P></P>
 Asking another character his alignment is futile, anyway--a lawful good
character may feel compelled to tell the truth, but a chaotic evil character
certainly won't. A chaotic evil character with any wit would reply &quot;lawful good.&quot;
<P></P>
 Player characters can only say what they think their alignment is. Once they
have chosen their alignment, the DM is the only person in the game who knows
where it currently stands. A chaotic good ranger may be on the verge of changing
alignment--one more cold-blooded deed and over the edge he goes. But he doesn't
know that. He still thinks he is chaotic good through and through.
