 The initiative modifier of a scroll is its reading time. For scroll spells,
this is equal to the casting time of the spell. For <I>protection</I> scrolls, the reading time is given in the explanation of the scroll effects.
<P></P>
 The only requirements for using a scroll are sufficient light to read by and
the actual verbalization of the writings. If the reading of a scroll is
interrupted, the scroll effect is lost and that spell fades away and is lost. Spell
components are unnecessary for the scroll reader, and no adverse effects
associated with casting the spell are suffered—these requirements or penalties have been
fulfilled or suffered by the creator of the scroll.
