<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Protection from Possession:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">(Reading time—1 round) This scroll generates a magical circle of 10-foot
radius that extends from, and moves with, the reader. All creatures within its
confines are protected from possession by magical spell attacks such as <I>magic jar</I> or attack forms aimed at possession or mental control. Even the dead are
protected if they are within the magic circle. The protection lasts for 10d6 rounds
in 90% of these scrolls; 10% have power that lasts 10d6 turns, but the spell
effect is stationary.
