 Treasure is more than just a goal, a measure of material wealth, however. &quot;It
takes money to get money,&quot; so the old saying goes, and for adventurers one
could even say, &quot;It takes money to stay alive.&quot; As characters survive and succeed,
their challenges become greater and more deadly.
<P></P>
 At first level a simple suit of studded armor, a stout pair of boots, and a
few simple spells were all a character needed; at higher levels such simple
impediments no longer suffice. Faced with terrible foes, characters quickly discover
that they need strong armors, barded horses, a variety of weapons,
fortifications, men-at-arms, potions, scrolls, and potent magical items.
<P></P>
 These are the kinds of things the characters have to find, make, or buy. And
however they go about acquiring them, they're going to need money. In a sense,
then, treasure is also a method of measuring a character's power. Even a
low-level character with money and magic to spare is more than a match for an
impoverished fellow of higher level. Thus, getting rich and getting ahead are rewards
in and of themselves.
