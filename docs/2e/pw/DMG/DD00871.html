<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Amulet of Life Protection:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This pendant or brooch device serves as protection for the psyche. The wearer
is protected from the <I>magic jar</I> spell or any similar mental attack that would usurp control of the wearer's
body. If the wearer is slain, the psyche enters the amulet and is protected for
seven full days. Thereafter, it departs to the plane of its alignment. If the
amulet is destroyed during the seven days, the psyche is utterly and irrevocably
annihilated.
