<TITLE>Boots of Dancing-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Boots of Dancing:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">These magical boots expand or contract to fit any foot size, from halfling to
giant (just as other magical boots do). They radiate a dim magic if detection
is used. They are indistinguishable from other magical boots, and until actual
melee combat is engaged in they function like one of the other types of useful
boots below—DM's choice.
<P></P>
 When the wearer is in (or fleeing from) melee combat, the <I>boots of dancing</I> impede movement, begin to tap and shuffle, heel and toe, or shuffle off to
Buffalo, making the wearer behave as if <I>Otto's irresistible dance</I> spell had been cast upon him (-4 penalty to Armor Class rating, saving throws
with a -6, and no attacks possible). Only a <I>remove curse</I> spell will enable the boots to be removed once their true nature is revealed.
<P></P>
