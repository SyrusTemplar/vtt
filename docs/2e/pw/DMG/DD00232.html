 If most people do not fall into a particular character class, how common are
those with character classes and how do they fit into the society around them?
<P></P>
 This is an important question, one you will answer as you create your
campaign. You don't have to sit down and think out an exact answer (&quot;2% of the
population are adventurers&quot;), although you can get that precise if you want. More
likely, the answer will form over time as you populate villages, create encounters,
and DM game sessions--you will unconsciously make your choices about frequency
and character role. There are, however, differences in how frequently the
different classes will logically show up.
