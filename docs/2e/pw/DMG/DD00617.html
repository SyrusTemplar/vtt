 There are two definitions of infravision that can be used in the AD&amp;D game.
The first is simple but lacks detail. It is, however, a perfectly adequate
definition for those who don't want to bother with the complexities of infravision.
The second, optional, definition, adds another level of detail to the game. It
allows the DM to create special situations in which the function of infravision
becomes important, but requires the DM to keep track of more rules and more
details.
