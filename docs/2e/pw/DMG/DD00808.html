<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ring of Truth:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">There is little doubt that wearing a <I>ring of truth</I> is a mixed blessing. The wearer can detect any lie told to him, but he is
unable to tell any sort of falsehood himself. If the wearer tries to tell a lie,
he finds himself speaking the literal truth instead. On the plus side, the
wearer is able to discern the last lie told by another—in fact, the power of the
ring causes the voice of the liar to rise to a falsetto.
<P></P>
 If the wearer of the ring encounters magic that enables falsehoods to be
spoken without detection (such as an <I>undetectable lie</I> spell or a <I>philter of glibness</I>), no lie is detected. However, the ring wearer will find himself unable to
hear the voice of the person so influenced, whether or not he is trying to
listen. This, of course, reveals the lie indirectly.
