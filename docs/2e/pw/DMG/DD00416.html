 The actual size of a weapon has little to do with the space needed to wield
it. An awl pike is 12 to 20 feet long, yet since it is a thrusting weapon it
needs virtually no space side-to-side. It does, however, need that 12 to 20 feet in
front! A sabre and a battle-axe are about the same size, but the battle axe
requires more space--the sabre can be thrust straight forward into a narrower
space, while the battle axe must be swung mightily, which takes a lot of space.
<P></P>
 The DM must decide whether a character has enough space to use a particular
weapon in a particular setting and situation.
<P></P>
 As a guideline, the AD&amp;D rules assume that two fighters using swords can work
side-by-side in a 10-foot-wide area. The same space would be filled by one
fighter using a two-handed sword.
