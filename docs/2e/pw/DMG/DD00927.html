<TITLE>Daern's Instant Fortress-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Daern's Instant Fortress:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This metal cube is small, but when activated it grows to form a tower 20 feet
square and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a machicolated
battlement atop it. The metal walls extend 10 feet into the ground. The fortress has
a small door which will open only at the command of the owner of the
fortress—even <I>knock</I> spells can't open the door.
<P></P>
 The adamantite walls of <I>Daern's instant fortress</I> are unaffected by normal weapons other than catapults. The tower can absorb
200 points of damage before collapsing. Damage sustained is cumulative, and the
fortress cannot be repaired (although a <I>wish</I> will restore 10 points of damage sustained).
<P></P>
 The fortress springs up in just one round, with the door facing the device's
owner. The door will open and close instantly at his command. People and
creatures (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress's sudden
growth. Anyone so caught sustains 10d10 points of damage.
<P></P>
