 Depopulating an area will get a strong negative reaction from local officials.
If the player character seeks only a few hirelings, he is not likely to run
into difficulty unless he wishes to take them away (i.e., back to his own
castle). This type of poaching will certainly create trouble.
<P></P>
 If Targash, having established his paladin's castle, needs 300 peasants to
work the field, he cannot go into the nearby town and recruit 300 people without
causing a reaction! The lord and the town burghers are going to consider this
tantamount to wholesale kidnapping.
<P></P>
 Finally, local officials have this funny way of getting upset about strange
armies. If Targash comes into town to raise 300 heavy cavalry, the local lord is
sure to notice! No one likes strangers raising armies in their territory. It
is, after all, a threat to their power.
