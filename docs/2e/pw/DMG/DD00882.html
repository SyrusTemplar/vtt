<TITLE>Beaker of Plentiful Potions-- Magical Item (DMG)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Beaker of Plentiful Potions:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This container resembles a jug or flask. It is a magical beaker with
alchemical properties allowing it to create 1d4 + 1 doses of 1d4 + 1 potions. (The kinds
of potions are determined by random selection on <A HREF="DD00675.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00675.html">Table 89</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> .) Different potion sorts are layered in the container, and each pouring
takes one round and results in one dose of one potion type.
<P></P>
 Roll 1d4+1, to find the number of potions the beaker contains—<I>delusion</I> and <I>poison</I> are possible. Record each potion in order of occurrence—the potions are
layered and are poured in order. Duplication is possible.
<P></P>
 If the container holds only two potions, it will dispense them one each per
day, three times per week; if three are contained, it will dispense them one each
per day, two times per week; and if four or five are contained it will produce
each just one time per week.
<P></P>
 Once opened, the beaker gradually loses the ability to produce potions. This
reduction in ability results in the permanent loss of one potion type per month,
determined randomly.
