 There are three types of hirelings: common, experts, and soldiers. Common
hirelings form the vast majority of any population, particularly in an agricultural
community.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Common hirelings</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">are farmers, millers, innkeepers, porters, and the like. While some of these
professions require special knowledge, they don't, as a rule, require highly
specialized training. These are the men and women whose work forms the base upon
which civilized life is built.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Expert hirelings</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">are those whose training is specialized. This group includes craftsmen, sages,
spies, assassins, alchemists, animal trainers, and the like. Since not
everyone is trained in these skills, few experts are available for hire, and these few
earn more than the common hireling. Indeed, truly exotic experts (such as
spies) are very rare and extremely expensive.
<P></P>
 The skills and abilities of expert hirelings can be determined by using the

needed to exercise many crafts.
