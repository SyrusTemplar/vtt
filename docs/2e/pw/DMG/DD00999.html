<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Maul of the Titans:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This huge mallet is 8 feet long and weighs over 150 pounds. Any giant-sized
creature with Strength of 21 or grater can employ it to drive piles of up to 2
feet in diameter into normal earth at 4 feet per blow—two blows per round. The
maul will smash to flinders an oaken door of up to 10-foot height by 4-foot width
by 2-inch thickness in one blow—two if the door is heavily bound with iron. If
used as a weapon, it has a +2 bonus to attack rolls and inflicts 4d10 hit
points of damage, exclusive of Strength bonuses.
