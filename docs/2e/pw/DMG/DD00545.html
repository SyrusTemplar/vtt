 There are a multitude of ways a DM can create encounter tables (as many ways
as there are different ranges of die rolls). The choices range from very simple
(roll 1d6 for one of six possible choices) to very complicated (roll percentile
dice, modify for time of day and weather and cross-index the result with the
terrain). With this, and the common characteristics described above, in mind,
you can create random encounter tables for virtually any situation.
<P></P>
 As already noted, an encounter table can be constructed around virtually any
type of die or dice roll. Two of the best, however, are the 2-20 table and the
percentile table. Both provide a wide enough range of results to account for the
varying frequency of appearance of the monsters the DM wants to use.
