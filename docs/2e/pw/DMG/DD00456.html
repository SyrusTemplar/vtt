 The saving throw is a die roll that gives a chance, however slim, that the
character or creature finds some way to save himself from certain destruction, or
at least lessen the damage of a successful attack.
<P></P>
 More often than not, the saving throw represents an instinctive act on the
part of the character--diving to the ground just as a fireball scorches the group;
blanking the mind just as a mental battle begins; blocking the worst of an
acid spray with a shield. The exact action is not important. DMs and players can
think of lively and colorful explanations of why a saving throw succeeded or
failed. Explanations tailored to the events of the moment enhance the excitement
of the game.
