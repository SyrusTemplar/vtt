</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> If the DM desires, unleashing the power of a stave can require a specific
command word or phrase that must be discovered or researched separately from the
item itself. This command can be as simple as a single word (&quot;Heal'') or could be
as complicated as a rhyming phrase that must be adjusted to fit the
circumstances (&quot;I touch this elf; restore his health,&quot; or &quot;In this moment of great toil,
I command thee, staff—uncoil!&quot;). Since command words are the key to great
power, wise owners will memorize them and destroy all other evidence. Indeed,
knowledge of command words can be used as a bargaining point in surrender
negotiations.
