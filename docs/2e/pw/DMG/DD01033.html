<TITLE>Robe of Powerlessness-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Robe of Powerlessness:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A <I>robe of powerlessness</I> appears to be a robe of another sort, and detection will discover nothing
more than the fact that it has a magical aura. As soon as a character dons this
garment, he drops to 3 Strength and 3 Intelligence, forgetting all spells and
magical knowledge. The robe can be removed easily, but in order to restore mind
and body, the character must have a <I>remove curse</I> spell and then a <I>heal</I> spell placed upon him.
