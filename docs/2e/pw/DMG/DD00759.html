 When a scroll is copied into a spellbook or read to release its magic, the
writing completely and permanently disappears from the scroll. The magic content
of the spell is bound up in the writing, and use releases and erases it. Thus,
reading a spell from a scroll of seven spells makes the item a scroll of six
spells. No matter what a player may try, each spell on a scroll is only usable
once. Exceptions should be made very rarely and only when you have a very special
magical item in mind—perhaps a scroll that can be read once per week. This
would be potent magic indeed.
