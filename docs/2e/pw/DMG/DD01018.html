<TITLE>Philosopher's Stone-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Philosopher's Stone:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This is a rare and magical substance that appears to be an ordinary, sooty
black piece of rock. It radiates faintly of unknown magic. If the stone is broken
open, a cavity will be discovered. The interior of this cavity is lined with a
quicksilver which enables the transmutation of the base metals (iron and lead)
into silver and gold. A wizard will be required to bring about such
transmutation, however.
<P></P>
 From 50 to 500 pounds of iron can be made into silver; from 10 to 100 pounds
of lead can be turned into gold from a single <I>philosopher's stone</I>. Transmutation must be made fully upon the first attempt, all the quicksilver
being employed at one time.
<P></P>
 Two other substances may be found in a <I>philosopher's stone</I> instead of the quicksilver described above, at the DM's discretion. If he
decides there's something different in the stone, there is a 75% chance that a
greenish, crystalline salt will be found. This allows the manufacture of 1d4 <I>potions of longevity.</I> There is a 25% chance that a white powder will be found in a stone. When
mixed with a <I>potion of longevity,</I> this can actually restore life to a dead human or demihuman. The mixture must
be administered internally within one week of the creature's demise (see the <A HREF="../PHB/DD02246.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD02246.html">raise dead</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> spell).
