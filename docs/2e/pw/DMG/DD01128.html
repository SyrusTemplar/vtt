<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sword of Life Stealing:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This +2 weapon will eliminate one level of experience (or Hit Die) and
accompanying hit points and abilities when it strikes any opponent on a natural roll
of 20. This function is the same as the level-draining ability of certain undead
creatures.
<P></P>
 The sword wielder can gain as many hit points as an opponent loses to this
function of the weapon, up to the maximum number of hit points the character is
allowed (i.e., only a character who has suffered loss of hit points can benefit
from the function).
