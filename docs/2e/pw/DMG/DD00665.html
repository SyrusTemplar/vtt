 Finally, outside all else are the <I>Outer Planes,</I> also called the Planes of Power. There are 17 known Outer Planes—there may be
more. These planes can be reached only by powerful spells or by crossing the
Astral plane.
<P></P>
 Each outer plane is unique. Some seem quite similar to the primes; others have
terrain and physical laws wildly different from that to which the characters
may be accustomed. Magic functions differently on each plane as do many other
common assumptions of reality.
<P></P>
 Powerful beings (self-proclaimed gods, goddesses, and demi-gods) inhabit these
planes along with a full range of other life forms. The outer planes are the
final resting place of the spirits of intelligent life forms of the Prime
Material planes.
<P></P>
 The known outer planes have been named by humans. Some of these names are:
<P></P>

<P></P>
 Mechanus
<P></P>
 Arcadia
<P></P>
 Mount Celestia
<P></P>
 Bytopia
<P></P>
 Elysium
<P></P>
 Beastlands
<P></P>
 Olympus
<P></P>
 Ysgard
<P></P>
 Limbo
<P></P>
 Pandemonium
<P></P>
 The Abyss
<P></P>
 Carceri
<P></P>
 Gray Waste
<P></P>
 Gehenna
<P></P>
 Baator
<P></P>
 Acheron
<P></P>
 The Outlands
<P></P>

<P></P>
 These names are not necessarily consistent from world to world or Prime
Material Plane to Prime Material Plane. Indeed, since the planes are without
dimension and form, it is possible for different lands in the same campaign world to
have entirely different pictures of planar structure and order.
<P></P>
 For example, an oriental-type world might see the Outer Planes not as a series
of separate regions, but as a single mass throughout which are scattered
different agencies of the Celestial Bureaucracy. The Celestial Emperor might reside
on one plane, while his Minister of State operated from another.
<P></P>
 A Nordic land would see the plane of Ysgard as dominant over all others, in
accordance with the importance they ascribe the powers there. These things are
left to your discretion, as the DM. The planes can be molded to meet the needs of
your campaign.
