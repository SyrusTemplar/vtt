</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> There will come a time when player characters feel in dire need of a
particular spell or spells to which no one in their group has access. They may need to
raise a fallen comrade, remove an evil enchantment, or provide an additional
protection. The natural solution is to find an NPC willing and able to cast the
spell. This can create special difficulties for both the players and the DM.
