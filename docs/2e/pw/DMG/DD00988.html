<TITLE>Libram of Gainful Conjuration-- Magical Item (DMG)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Libram of Gainful Conjuration:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This mystic book contains much arcane knowledge for wizards of neutral,
chaotic neutral, and lawful neutral alignment. If a character of this class and
alignment spends a full week cloistered and undisturbed, pondering its contents, he
gains experience points sufficient to place him exactly at the mid-point of the
next higher level. When this occurs, the libram disappears—totally gone—and
that character can never benefit again from reading such a work.
<P></P>
 Any non-neutral wizard reading so much as a line of the libram suffers 5d4
points of damage, falls unconscious for a like number of turns, and must seek a
priest in order to atone and regain the ability to progress in experience (until
doing so, he gains no further experience).
<P></P>
 Any nonwizard perusing the work must roll a saving throw vs. spell in order to
avoid insanity. Characters who go insane can be healed only by a <I>remove curse</I> and rest for 1 month or by having a priest <I>heal</I> them.
<P></P>
