 Many spells used by priests and wizards take effect only when the target is
touched by the caster. Under normal circumstances, this is no problem. The
spellcaster reaches out and touches the recipient. However, if the target is
unwilling, or the spell is used in the midst of a general melee, the situation is much
different.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Unwilling Targets:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The spellcaster must make a successful attack roll for the spell to have any
effect. The wizard or priest calculates his THAC0 number normally, according to
the intended victim's Armor Class and other protections. The DM can modify the
roll if the victim is unprepared for or unaware of the attack. If the roll
succeeds, the spellcaster touches the target and the normal spell effect occurs.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Willing Targets:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">When attempting to cast a spell on a willing target, the casting is automatic
as long as both characters are not engaged in combat. For example, if a fighter
withdraws from melee, a cleric could heal him during the next round.
<P></P>
 If the recipient of the spell attempts to do anything besides waiting for the
spell to take effect, an attack roll against AC 10 must be made. However, no AC
modifiers for Dexterity are applied, since the target is not trying to avoid
the spell.
<P></P>
 Whenever a touch spell is successful, the spellcaster suffers from any special
defenses of his target, if they are continually in operation. A successful
touch to a vampire would not result in energy drain, since the power only works
when the vampire wills it. But touching a fire elemental would result in serious
burns.
<P></P>
 When a touch spell is cast, it normally remains effective only for that round.
However, certain spells list special conditions or durations. Be sure to check
each spell description carefully.
