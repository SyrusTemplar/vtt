 Within these alignments, of course, many other government types are possible.
Furthermore, even within the same kingdom or empire, there may be areas of
different alignment. The capital city, for example, where merchants and politicians
congregate, may be much more lawful (or evil, etc.) than a remote farming
community.
<P></P>
 And alignment is only one pattern of social organization. Not every nation or
barony is defined by its alignment. Other methods of describing a group of
people can also be used--peaceful, warlike, barbaric, decadent, dictatorial, and
civilized are all possible descriptions.

 You need only look at the world today to see the variety of societies and
cultures that abound in the realms of man. A good DM will sprinkle his campaign
world with exotic cultures created from his own imagination or researched at the
local library.
