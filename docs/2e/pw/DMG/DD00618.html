</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> The easiest definition of infravision is that it allows characters to see in
the dark. Nothing more is said about how this works—it simply works. Characters
do not see into the infared spectrum or &quot;see'' heat or anything else. They just
see in the dark as clearly as they do in normal light. However, since it is a
somewhat magical power, the range is not that of normal vision—infravision
ability extends only 60 feet. Beyond this only normal vision is allowed.
