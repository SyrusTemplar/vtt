<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Spear, Cursed Backbiter:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This is to all tests a magical spear with a +1 bonus (or at the DM's option +2
or +3). It may even function normally in combat against a deadly enemy, but
each time it is used in melee against a foe, there is a one in 20 cumulative
chance that it will function against its wielder. Once it begins functioning in
this way, you can't get rid of it without a <I>remove curse</I> spell. The character always seems to find the spear in his hand despite his
best efforts or intentions.
<P></P>
 When the curse takes effect, the spear curls around to strike its wielder in
the back, negating any shield and Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class, and
inflicting normal damage. The curse even functions when the spear is hurled, but if the
wielder has hurled the spear, the damage done to the hurler will be double.
Once the spear has returned to him, the character will again find himself
compelled to use the spear.
