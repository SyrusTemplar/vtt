 Magic resistance applies only if the successful casting of a spell would
directly affect the resistant creature or item. Thus, magic resistance is effective
against a<I> magic missile</I> (targeted at a creature or item) or a<I> fireball</I> spell (damaging the area the creature or item is in).
<P></P>
 Magic resistance is not effective against an earthquake caused by a spell.
While the creature could suffer injury or death falling into a chasm the spell
opens under its feet, the magical energy of the spell was directed at the ground,
not the creature. Magic resistant creatures are not immune to events that occur
as the consequence of spells, only to the direct energy created or released by
a spell.
<P></P>
 Player characters do not normally have magic resistance (though they still get
saving throws vs. magical spells and such). This ability is reserved mainly
for special monsters.
