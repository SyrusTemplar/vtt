<TITLE>Trident of Fish Command-- Magical Weapon (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Trident of Fish Command:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This three-tined fork atop a stout 6-foot long rod appears to be a barbed
military fork of some sort. However, its magical properties enable its wielder to
cause all fish within a 60-foot radius to roll saving throws vs. spell. This
uses one charge of the trident. Fish failing this throw are completely under
empathic command and will not attack the possessor of the trident nor any creature
within 10 feet of him. The wielder of the device can cause fish to move in
whatever direction is desired and can convey messages of emotion (i.e., fear,
hunger, anger, indifference, repletion, etc.). Fish making their saving throw are
free of empathic control, but they will not approach within 10 feet of the trident.
<P></P>
 In addition to ordinary fish, the trident affects sharks and eels. It doesn't
affect mollusks, crustaceans, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and similar sorts
of nonpiscine marine creatures. A school of fish should be checked as a single
entity.
<P></P>
 A trident of this type contains 1d4+16 charges. It is otherwise a +1 magical
weapon.
