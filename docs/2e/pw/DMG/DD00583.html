 When hiring, the first step is to figure out if the player character is going
to offend anyone, particularly the ruler of the city or town. Feudal lords have
very specific ideas about their land and their property (the latter of which
sometimes includes the people on his land).
<P></P>
 If the hirelings are true freedmen, they can decide to come and go as they
please. More often, the case is that the hirelings are bound to the fief. They are
not slaves, but they cannot leave the land without the permission of their
lord.
