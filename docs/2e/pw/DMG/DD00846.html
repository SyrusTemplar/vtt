 Wands are 1¼ feet long and slender. They are made of ivory, bone, or wood and
are usually tipped with something—metal, crystal, stone, etc. They are fragile
and tend to break easily. Because of this, they are often kept in cases.
<P></P>
 Wands perform at 6th level of experience with respect to the damage they
cause, range, duration, area of effect, etc., unless otherwise stated.
<P></P>
 At the DM's option, 1% of all wands can be trapped to backfire.
<P></P>
 Wands are powered by charges, each use costing one or more charges (depending
on the item). When discovered, a wand typically contains 1d20+80 charges.
Captured wands taken from a defeated foe often have many fewer charges. Wands never
have a greater number of charges than those listed. Most wands can be recharged
according to the rules for making magical items.
<P></P>
 When a wand runs out of charges, it can no longer be recharged. Furthermore,
the DM can rule that the wand immediately crumbles into useless dust (settling
the issue) or is now a useless, nonmagical stick.
