<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Gauntlets of Swimming and Climbing:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A pair of these gloves appear to be normal light-weight handwear, but they
radiate magic if a detection is attempted. The wearer can have hands of large
(human) or small (halfling) size. The wearer can swim as fast as a triton (movement
of 15) underwater, and as fast as a merman (movement 18) on the surface. These
gauntlets do not empower the wearer to breathe in water.
<P></P>
 These gloves give the wearer a very strong gripping ability with respect to
climbing. He can climb vertical or nearly vertical surfaces, upward or downward,
with a 95% chance of success. If the wearer is a thief, the gauntlets increase
success probability to 99%.
