<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Horseshoes of Speed:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">These iron shoes come in sets of four like ordinary horseshoes, but they are
magical and will not wear out. When affixed to a horse's hooves, they double the
animal's speed. There is a 1% chance per 20 miles traveled that a shoe will
drop off, and if this passes unnoticed, the horse's speed will drop to 150%
normal rate. If two or more are lost, speed returns to normal.
