<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sword+2, Nine Lives Stealer:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This will always perform as a +2 weapon, but it also has the power to draw the
life force from an opponent. It can do this nine times before the ability is
lost. A natural 20 must be scored on the wielder's attack roll for the sword to
function. The victim is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. If this succeeds,
the sword does not function, no charge is used, and normal damage is
determined.
