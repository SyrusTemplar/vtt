 Sometimes the DM discovers his random encounters gave away too much treasure.
In this case, he can have more monsters of the same or more powerful type
appear on the scene. (The first group stole the treasure and these fellows want it
back; or the first was carrying the tribe's treasury to safe-keeping; or the new
group has been trailing the first to rob them, and now takes a very dim view
of the characters getting all the loot.) In many ways this is like those
westerns where everyone winds up fighting over the gold. In this case, the monsters
don't want to annihilate the player characters so much as get the loot and run.
