 The DM can rule that magical weapons (particularly swords, daggers, and +3 or
greater items) shed light and can't be concealed when drawn. However, a magical
sword should never glow until the wielder is aware of its magical
properties—the light-giving property of a weapon should never be used as an excuse to
identify a magical item. Note that the <I>flame tongue, frost brand, holy avenger, life stealing,</I> and <I>sharpness</I> swords have special properties with regard to light. These are dealt with in
the individual weapon descriptions.
