Many factors affect a character's background. Two of the most important are
his race and his character class (see <A HREF="DD00228.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00228.html">Chapter 3</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> , &quot;Player Character Classes&quot;). In a sense, a character's class is his
profession. Some characters are fighters, some are mages, some are clerics, and so on.
A character's race affects which character classes are available to him. Only
humans have unlimited class options. All non-human races are limited to some
extent. There are two reasons for this:
<P></P>
 First, the restrictions are intended to channel players into careers that make
sense for the various races. Dwarves are, to a certain degree, anti-magical
and incapable of shaping magical energy--they can't be wizards. Halflings,
despite their ties to nature, lack the devotion and physical will to be druids.
Similar situations exist for the other demihuman races.
<P></P>
 Second, the demihuman races have advantages that are not available to humans.
Flexibility, the ability to choose from among all the classes, is one of very
few human advantages.
