<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cube of Frost Resistance:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">When the cube is activated it encloses an area 10 feet per side, resembling a <I>cube of force.</I> The temperature within this area is always 65 degrees F. The field will
absorb all cold-based attacks (i.e., <I>cone of cold, ice storm,</I> and even white dragon's breath). However, if the field is subjected to more
than 50 points of cold damage in any turn (10 rounds), it collapses and cannot
be renewed for one hour. If it receives over 100 points of damage in one turn,
the cube is destroyed.
<P></P>
 Cold below 0 degrees F. effectively inflicts 2 points of cold damage on the
cube for every -10 degrees F., -4 at -11 to -20, etc. Thus, at -40 degrees F. the
device can withstand only 42 points of damage.
