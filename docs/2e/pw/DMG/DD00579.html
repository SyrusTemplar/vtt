 Soldiers are the last group of hirelings. In a sense, they are expert
hirelings skilled in the science of warfare (or at least so player characters hope).
However, unlike most experts, their lives are forfeit if their skills are below
par. Because of this, they require special treatment. In hindsight, many a
deposed tyrant wishes he'd treated his soldiers better! Some of the different types
of soldier characters can hire or encounter are listed on Table 64.
