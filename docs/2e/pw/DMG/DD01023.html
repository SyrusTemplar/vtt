<TITLE>Pipes of Pain-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Pipes of Pain:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">These appear to be like any other standard or magical set of pipes with
nothing to reveal their true nature. When played by a character proficient in music,
the pipes create a wondrous melody, surpassing any sound ever heard. All within
30 feet, including the piper, must save vs. spells or be enchanted by the
sound. So long as the pipes are played, no one will attack or attempt any action if
affected.
<P></P>
 As soon as the piping stops, all those affected will be stricken by intense
pain at even the slightest noise, causing 1d4 points of damage per round. This
pain will last for 2d4 rounds. Thereafter, the least noise will cause the victim
to wince, reducing the character's attack and saving throw rolls -2. The effect
can be negated only by a <I>forget</I> or <I>remove curse</I> spell.
