 In general, missile combat is handled identically to standard melee.
Intentions are announced, initiative is rolled, and attack rolls are made. However,
there are special rules and situations that apply only to missile combat.
<P></P>
 Missile weapons are divided into two general categories. The first includes
all standard, direct-fire, single-target missiles, such as slings, arrows,
quarrels, spears, throwing axes, and the like. The second includes all grenade-like
missiles that have an area effect. Thus an attack with these weapons does not
have to hit the target directly. Included in this group are small flasks of oil,
acid, poison, holy water, potions, and boulders. Hurled boulders are included
because they bounce and bound along after they hit, leaving a swath of
destruction.
