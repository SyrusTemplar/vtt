<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Gauntlets of Ogre Power:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">These appear the same as typical handwear for armor. The wearer of these
gloves, however, is imbued with 18/00 Strength in his hands, arms, and shoulders.
When striking with the hand or with a weapon hurled or held, the gauntlets add a
+3 bonus to attack rolls and a +6 bonus to damage inflicted when a hit is made.
These gauntlets are particularly desirable when combined with a <I>girdle of giant strength</I> and a hurled weapon. They grow or shrink to fit human to halfling-sized hands.
