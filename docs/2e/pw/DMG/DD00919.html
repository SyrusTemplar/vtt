<TITLE>Cloak of the Manta Ray-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<A NAME="6de7958e"></A><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cloak of the Manta Ray:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This cloak appears to be made of leather until the wearer enters salt water.
At that time the <I>cloak of the manta ray</I> adheres to the individual, and he appears nearly identical to a
manta-ray—there is only a 10% chance that someone seeing the wearer will know he isn't a
manta ray.
<P></P>
 The wearer can breathe underwater and has a movement rate of 18, like a manta
ray (see the <A HREF="../MM/DD03890.html#43863525"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../MM/DD03890.html#43863525">Monstrous Compendium</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> ). The wearer also has an Armor Class of at least six, that of a manta ray.
Other magical protections or magical armor can improve that armor value.
<P></P>
 Although the cloak does not enable the wearer to bite opponents as a manta ray
does, the garment has a tail spine which can be used to strike at opponents
behind him. The spine inflicts 1d6 points of damage, and there is no chance of
stunning. This attack can be used in addition to other sorts, for the wearer can
release his arms from the cloak without sacrificing underwater movement if so
desired.
