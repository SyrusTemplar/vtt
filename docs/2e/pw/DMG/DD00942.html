<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Eyes of the Eagle:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">These items are made of special crystal and fit over the eyes of the wearer.
They give vision 100 times greater than normal at distances of 1 foot or more
(i.e., the wearer can see at 2,000 feet what a person could normally see at 20
feet). Wearing only one of the pair causes a character to become dizzy and, in
effect, stunned, for one round. Thereafter, one eye must always be covered to
avoid this sensation of vertigo.
