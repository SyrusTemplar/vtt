 This was the period after the collapse of the Roman Empire, from 450 A.D. to
about 1100 A.D. While much of the learning and culture of the ancient world was
lost, it was not as bleak and ignorant a period as some believe. Still, in many
ways, it was a step backward from the previous age. During this time the
stirrup was introduced, allowing riders to gain full use of the lance.
