<TITLE>Horn of Bubbles-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Horn of Bubbles:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This cursed musical instrument will radiate magic if detected for. It appears
as a normal horn, or possibly any of the many magical ones. It will sound a
note and call forth a mass of bubbles that completely surround and blind the
individual who blew the horn for 2d10 rounds, but these bubbles appear only in the
presence of a creature actively seeking to slay the character who played the
horn, so their appearance might be delayed for a very short or extremely lengthy
period.
