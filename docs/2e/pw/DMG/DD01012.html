<TITLE>Pearl of the Sirines-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Pearl of the Sirines:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This normal-seeming pearl radiates faintly of enchantment if magic is detected
for. In any event, the stone will be very beautiful and worth at least 1,000
gp on this basis alone. If it is clasped firmly in hand (or to the breast) and
the possessor attempts actions related to the pearl's power areas, he will
understand and be able to employ the item.
<P></P>
 The pearl enables its possessor to breathe in water as if he were in clean,
fresh air. Underwater movement rate is 24. The possessor is immune to ill effects
from the poison touch of a sirine. The pearl must be within the general area
of the possessor—less than 10 feet distant—to convey its powers to him.
