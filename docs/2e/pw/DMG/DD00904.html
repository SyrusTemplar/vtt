are jewels set in it). It is used to fasten a cloak or cape. In addition to this
mundane task, it can absorb magic missiles of the sort generated by spell,
wand, or other magical device. A brooch can absorb up to 101 points of <I>magic missile</I> damage before it melts and becomes useless. Its use can be determined only by
means of a <I>detect magic</I> spell and then experimentation.
