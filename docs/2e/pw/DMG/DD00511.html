Characters in a role-playing game strive for many things—fame, glory,
experience, among them. But for those who are not fully satisfied with such intangible
rewards, there is one other goal—fortune.
<P></P>
 Strands of glittering golden chains, stacks of silver coin, heaps of marten
fur, bejeweled crowns, enameled sceptres, silken cloths, and powerful magical
items all wait to be discovered—or wrested from the grasp of powerful monsters.
With such treasures awaiting, how could any bold adventurer be content to remain
peacefully at home?
