<TITLE>Scarab of Death-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Scarab of Death:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This small pin appears to be any one of the various beneficial amulets,
brooches, or scarabs. However, if it is held for more than one round or placed within
a soft container (bag, pack, etc.) within 1 foot of a warm, living body for
one turn, it changes into a horrible burrowing beetle-like creature. The thing
will tear through any leather or cloth, burrow into flesh, and reach the victim's
heart in a single round, causing death. It then returns to its scarab form.
(Placing the scarab in a container of hard wood, ceramic, bone, ivory, or metal
will prevent the monster from coming to life.)
