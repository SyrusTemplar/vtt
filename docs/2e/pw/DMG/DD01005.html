<TITLE>Murylynd's Spoon-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Murlynd's Spoon:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This unremarkable eating utensil is typically fashioned from horn. It radiates
a dim aura of conjuration if magic is detected for. If the spoon is placed in
an empty container—a bowl, a cup, dish, etc.—the vessel will fill with a thick,
pasty gruel. Although this substance has a flavor similar to warm, wet
cardboard, it is highly nourishing. It contains everything necessary to sustain any
herbivorous, omnivorous, or carnivorous creature. The spoon will produce
sufficient gruel each day to feed up to four humans.
