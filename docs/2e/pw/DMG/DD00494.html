 Characters heal naturally at a rate of 1 hit point per day of rest. Rest is
defined as low activity--nothing more strenuous than riding a horse or traveling
from one place to another. Fighting, running in fear, lifting a heavy boulder,
or any other physical activity, prevents resting, since it strains old wounds
and may even reopen them.
<P></P>
 If a character has complete bed-rest (doing nothing for an entire day), he can
regain 3 hit points for the day. For each complete week of bed rest, the
character can add any Constitution hit point bonus he might have to the base of 21
points (3 points per day) he regained during that week.
<P></P>
 In both cases above, the character is assumed to be getting adequate food,
water, and sleep. If these are lacking, the character does not regain any hit
points that day.
