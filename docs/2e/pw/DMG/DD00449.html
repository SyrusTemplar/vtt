 Hurled boulders are handled using the grenade-like missiles rules, even though
they do not burst. Boulders tend to bounce beyond their initial point of
impact and can hit several characters in a single attack. They are particularly
devastating against tightly packed groups.
<P></P>
 When attacking with a boulder, determine the target, to-hit number, and
scatter (in the case of a miss) according to the rules for grenade-like missiles. The
distance the boulder scatters should be doubled, however.
<P></P>
 If the boulder scatters to the left or right, it moves roughly 45 to 60
degrees off the original line of attack. A boulder moves along this line for 3d10
feet. If the targets are in a relatively open area (a group marching through a
snow field, for example), there is only a slim chance that anyone will be hit by
the bounding missile.
<P></P>
 If the boulder moves through a space occupied by a character (or monster),
roll again for a hit (recalculating THAC0 as necessary), applying a -2 penalty for
each 10 feet, or fraction thereof, the boulder has bounced since it hit.
<P></P>
 If the player characters are in an area where movement is restricted--a
formation of pikemen, for example, or a large party in a 10' wide corridor--no
additional boulder attack is made. The boulder strikes all targets in its path.
<P></P>
 The damage caused by a boulder as a result of scatter is less than from a
direct hit. Roll the damage normally, but subtract the distance in feet the boulder
has bounced to that point. This is the damage inflicted on the target.
