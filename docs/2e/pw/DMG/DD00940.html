<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Eversmoking Bottle:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This metal urn is identical to an <I>efreeti bottle</I> except that it does nothing but smoke. The amount of smoke is very great if
the stopper is pulled out, pouring from the bottle and totally obscuring vision
in a 50,000-cubic-foot area in one round. Left unstoppered, the bottle will
fill another 10,000 cubic feet of space with smoke each round until 120,000 cubic
feet of space is fogged. This area remains smoked until the <I>eversmoking bottle</I> is stoppered. When the bottle is stoppered, smoke dissipates normally. The
bottle can be resealed only if a command word is known.
