 Some monsters, particularly lycanthropes and powerful undead such as vampires,
are immune to normal weapons. Attackers need special weapons to hurt them. The
most common of these are silver and magical weapons.
<P></P>
 Special weapon requirements are listed in the monster descriptions as &quot;Silver
weapons or magic to attack&quot; or &quot;+2 weapons or better to hit,&quot; or something
similar. The listed weapon, or one of greater power, must be used to damage the
monster. Magical weapons are of greater power than silver weapons and each plus a
magical weapon gets is a measure of power. Obviously, then, a<I> sword +2</I> is more powerful than a<I> sword +1</I>.
<P></P>
 Even creatures immune to certain weapons can be affected by magical spells,
unless a specific immunity to a spell, or group of spells, is listed in the
description, in the Monstrous Manual.
