<TITLE>Hammer of Thunderbolts-- Magical Weapon (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hammer of Thunderbolts:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This appears to be a large, extra-heavy hammer. A character less than 6 feet
tall and with Strength less than 18/01 will find it too unbalanced to wield
properly in combat. However, a character of sufficient Strength and size will find
that the hammer functions with a +3 bonus and gains double damage dice on any
hit.
<P></P>
 If the wielder wears a <I>girdle of giant strength</I> and <I>gauntlets of ogre power</I> and he knows the hammer's true name, the weapon can be used to full effect:
When swung or hurled it gains a +5 bonus, double damage dice, all <I>girdle</I> and <I>gauntlet</I> bonuses, and it strikes dead any giant upon which it scores a hit.
<P></P>
 (Depending on the campaign, the DM might wish to limit the effect to exclude
storm giants and include ogres, ogre magi, trolls, ettins, and clay, flesh, and
stone golems.)
<P></P>
 When hurled and successfully hitting, a great noise, like a clap of thunder,
stuns all creatures within 90 feet for one round. Throwing range is 180 feet.
(Thor would throw the hammer about double the above range.) The <I>hammer of thunderbolts</I> is difficult to hurl, so only one throw every other round can be made. After
five throws within the space of any two-turn period, the wielder must rest for
one turn.
<P></P>
 Hammers can be hurled as hand axes.
