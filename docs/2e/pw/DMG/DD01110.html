<TITLE>Sun Blade-- Magical Weapon (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sun Blade:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This sword is the size of a bastard sword. However, its enchantment enables
the <I>sun blade</I> to be wielded as if it were a short sword with respect to encumbrance,
weight, speed factor, and ease of use (i.e., the weapon appears to all viewers to be
a bastard sword, and inflicts bastard sword damage, but the wielder feels and
reacts as if the weapon were a short sword). Any individual able to use either a
bastard sword or a short sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a <I>sun blade.</I>
<P></P>
 In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a +2
sword. Against evil creatures, its bonus is +4. Against Negative Energy Plane
creatures or those drawing power from that plane (such as certain undead), the sword
inflicts double damage.
<P></P>
 Furthermore, the blade has a special <I>sunray</I> power. Once a day, upon command, the blade can be swung vigorously above the
head, and it will shed a bright yellow radiance that is like full daylight. The
radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword-wielder,
spreading outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, creating a globe of
light with a 60-foot radius. When the swinging stops, the radiance fades to a dim
glow that persists for another turn before disappearing entirely. All <I>sun blades</I> are of good alignment.
<P></P>
