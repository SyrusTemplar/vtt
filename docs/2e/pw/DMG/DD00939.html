<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Efreeti Bottle:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This item is typically fashioned of brass or bronze, with a lead stopper
bearing special seals. A thin stream of smoke is often seen issuing from it. There
is a 10% chance that the efreeti will be insane and attack immediately upon
being released. There is also a 10% chance that the efreeti of the bottle will only
grant three wishes. The other 80% of the time, however, the inhabitant of the
bottle will serve normally (see <A HREF="../MM/DD03896.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../MM/DD03896.html">Monstrous Manual</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> ). When opened, the efreeti issues from the bottle instantly.
