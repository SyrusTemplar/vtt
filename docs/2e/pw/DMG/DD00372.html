 There are two categories of experience point awards: group and individual.
Group awards are divided equally among all members of the adventuring party,
regardless of each individual's contribution. The idea here is that simply being
part of a group that accomplishes something teaches the player character something
useful.
<P></P>
 From a strictly game mechanics point of view, this ensures that all player
characters will have the opportunity to advance in experience points at roughly
the same rate. Individual awards are optional, given to each player based on the
actions of his character.
