<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ring of Shocking Grasp:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This ordinary-seeming ring radiates only a faint, unidentifiable aura of magic
when examined, but it contains a strong enchantment, capable of inflicting
damage on an opponent. If the wearer touches an enemy with the hand upon which the
ring is worn, a successful attack roll deliverers 1d8+6 points of damage to
the target.
<P></P>
 After three discharges of this nature, regardless of the time elapsed between
them, the ring becomes inert for one turn. When actually functioning, this ring
causes a circular, charged extrusion appear on the palm of the wearer's hand.
