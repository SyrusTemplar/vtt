<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Speed:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A <I>potion of speed</I> increases the movement and combat capabilities of the imbiber by 100%. Thus,
a movement rate of 9 becomes 18, and a character normally able to attack once
per round attacks twice. This does not reduce spellcasting time, however. Use of
a <I>speed</I> potion ages the individual by one year. The aging is permanent, but the other
effects last for 5d4 rounds.
