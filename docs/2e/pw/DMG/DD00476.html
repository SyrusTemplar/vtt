 The old saying, &quot;the best defense is a good offense&quot; is clearly true in the
AD&amp;D game. And the best way to avoid suffering damage is to beat the foe so badly
he wants to crawl under a rock or, better yet, run away. That's where morale
checks come in.
<P></P>
 The gnoll in front of Beornhelm smashes a mace against the fighter's shield,
just as the searing heat of lightning clips all the hair on the side of his
head. Instantly, the heat is followed by the booming thunderclap in his ear. All
the while, some vile little creature is trying to gnaw on his shin! It's really
enough to ruin an adventurer's day. But, Beornhelm is cool, calm and in
control--because the player running him says so. The same can't be said for the
monsters.
<P></P>
 In almost all situations, players should be the ones who decide what their
characters do. A DM should never tell a player, &quot;Your character decides he doesn't
want to get hurt and runs from the fight,&quot; unless that character is charmed
and therefore controlled by the DM.
<P></P>
 A suggestion that a character might want to retreat, advance, open a chest, or
whatever, is all right, but a DM shouldn't force a player character to do
something by simply insisting. Only under the most unusual circumstances--charm,
magical fear, or other forced effects--should the DM dictate the actions of a
player character.
<P></P>
 Monsters and NPCs are an entirely different matter, however. The DM makes
their decisions, trying to think like each creature or non-player character, in
turn.
<P></P>
 In combat, thinking like a creature mainly means deciding what actions it
takes and how badly it wants to fight. As a general rule, monsters and NPCs are no
more eager to die than player characters. Most withdraw when a fight starts to
go badly.
<P></P>
 Some panic and flee, even casting their weapons aside. If they think they can
get mercy, brighter foes might fall to their knees and surrender. A few
bloodthirsty or brainless types might fight to the death--but this doesn't happen too
often. These are the things that make up morale, things the DM must decide,
either through role-playing or dice rolling.
