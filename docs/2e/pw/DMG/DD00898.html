<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Bracers of Archery:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">These magical wrist bands are indistinguishable from normal, non-magical
protective wear. When worn by a character type or creature able to employ a bow,
they enable the wearer to excel at archery.
<P></P>
 The bracers empower such a wearer to use any bow (not including crossbows) as
if he were proficient in its usage, if such is not already the case. If the
wearer of the bracers has proficiency with any type of bow, he gains a +2 bonus to
attack rolls and a +1 bonus to damage inflicted whenever that type of bow is
used. These bonuses are cumulative with any others, including those already
bestowed by a magical bow or magical arrows, except for a bonus due to weapon
specialization.
