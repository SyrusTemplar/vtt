<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Well of Many Worlds:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This strange interdimensional device looks just like a <I>portable hole.</I> Anything placed within it is immediately cast to another world—a parallel
earth, another planet, or a different plane at the DM's option or by random
determination. If the well is moved, the random factor again comes into play. It can
be picked up, folded, etc., just like a <I>portable hole.</I> Things from the world the well touches can come through the opening, just as
easily as from the initiating place.
