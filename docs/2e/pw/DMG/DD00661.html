 At the very center of this series of spheres are the <I>Prime Material planes.</I> These are the planes most familiar to AD&amp;D game players. The prime material
planes include the many Earth-like alternate worlds and campaigns that operate
from the more or less the same basic realities. There may be variations from
prime to prime, but most features remain the same. The inhabitants of each prime
always refer to their plane as <I>the</I> Prime Material Plane.
