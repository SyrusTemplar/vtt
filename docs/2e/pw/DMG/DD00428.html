 These are the most basic of combat skills, unknowingly practiced by almost all
children as they rough and tumble with each other. Thus all characters,
regardless of class, are assumed to be somewhat proficient in both these forms of
fighting.
<P></P>
 Punching occurs when a character attacks with his fists. No weapons are used,
although the character can wear an iron gauntlet or similar item. Wrestling
requires both hands free, unencumbered by shields and the like.
<P></P>
 When punching or wrestling, a normal attack roll is made. The normal Armor
Class of the target is used. If a character is attempting to wrestle in armor, the
modifiers on <A HREF="DD00429.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00429.html">Table 42</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> are used (these are penalties to the foe's attack roll). Normal modifiers to
the attack roll are also applied.
