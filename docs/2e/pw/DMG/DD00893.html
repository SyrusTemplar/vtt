<TITLE>Boots of Striding and Springing-- Magical Item (DMG)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Boots of Striding and Springing:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The wearer of these magical boots has a base movement rate of 12, regardless
of size or weight. This speed can be maintained tirelessly for up to 12 hours
per day, but thereafter the boots no longer function for 12 hours—they need that
long to &quot;recharge.&quot;
<P></P>
 In addition to the striding ability, these boots allow the wearer to make
great leaps. While &quot;normal'' paces for the individual wearing this type of footgear
are three feet long, the boots also enable forward jumps of up to 30 feet,
backward leaps of 9 feet, and vertical springs of 15 feet.
<P></P>
 If circumstances permit the use of such movement in combat, the wearer can
effectively strike and spring away when he has the initiative during a melee
round. However, such activity involves a degree of danger—there is a base 20% chance
that the wearer of the boots will stumble and be stunned on the following
round. Adjust the 20% chance downward by 3% for each point of Dexterity the wearer
has above 12 (i.e., 17% at Dexterity, 14% at 14, 11% at 15, 8% at 16, 5% at 17,
and only 2% at 18 Dexterity). In any event, the boots better Armor Class by 1
due to the quickness of movement they allow, so Armor Class 2 becomes 1, Armor
Class 1 becomes 0, etc.
<P></P>
