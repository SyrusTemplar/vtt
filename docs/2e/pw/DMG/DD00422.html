 Since a round is roughly a minute long, it should be easy for a character to
move just about anywhere he wants during the course of the round. After all,
Olympic-class sprinters can cover vast amounts of ground in a minute.
<P></P>
 However, a character in an AD&amp;D game is not an Olympic sprinter running in a
straight line. He is trying to maneuver through a battle without getting killed.
He is keeping his eyes open for trouble, avoiding surprise, watching his back,
watching the backs of his partners, and looking for a good opening, while
simultaneously planning his next move, sometimes through a haze of pain. 
<P></P>
 He may be carrying a load of equipment that slows him down significantly.
Because of all these things, the distance a character can move is considerably less
than players generally think.
<P></P>
 In a combat round, a being can move up to 10 times its movement rating in feet
(see the<I> Player's Handbook</I> for information on <A HREF="../PHB/DD01774.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01774.html">character movement</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> .) Thus, if a character has a movement rating of 9, he can move up to 90 feet
in a round. However, the types of moves a character can make during combat are
somewhat limited.
