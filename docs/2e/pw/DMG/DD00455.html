 So far, the bulk of this chapter has dealt with ways to attack. In addition,
there are several ways to avoid suffering damage. Two of the most common are the
&quot;saving throw&quot; and &quot;magic resistance.&quot; Somewhat less common are the ability to
&quot;turn undead&quot; and immunity to particular weapon-types.
