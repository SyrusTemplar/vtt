 If any spell-user acquires a scroll inscribed with a spell of a level too high
for him to cast, he can still try to use the spell—the chance of failure, or
other bad effect, is 5% per level difference between the character's present
level and the level at which the spell could be used.
<P></P>
 For example, a 1st-level mage finds a scroll with a <I>wish</I> spell inscribed upon it. The chance of failure is 85%, as <I>wish</I> is a 9th-level spell attained at 18th level: 18-1 = 17; 17x5% = 85%. A
percentile die roll of 85 or less indicates failure of some sort, and <A HREF="DD00758.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00758.html">Table 112</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> is consulted. In this case, the spell is 30% likely to fail without effect,
while the chance for a reverse or harmful effect is 70%.
