<P></P>
 Many game terms are used throughout the combat rules. To understand the rules,
players must understand these terms, so brief explanations appear below.
Further details are provided throughout this chapter.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Armor Class (AC)</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">is the protective rating of a type of armor. In some circumstances, AC is
modified by the amount of protection gained or lost because of the character's
situation. For instance, crouching behind a boulder improves a character's Armor
Class, while being attacked from behind worsens his AC.
<P></P>
 Abilities and situations can also affect a character's Armor Class. High
Dexterity gives a bonus to Armor Class, for example. But even a character with a
Dexterity bonus can have this bonus negated if he is attacked from the rear.
<P></P>
 Armor provides protection by reducing the chance that a character is attacked
successfully (and suffers damage). Armor does not absorb damage, it prevents
it. A fighter in full plate mail may be a slow-moving target, but penetrating his
armor to cause any damage is no small task.
<P></P>
 Armor Class is measured on a scale from 10, the worst (no armor), to -10, the
best (very powerful magical armors). The lower the number, the more effective
the armor. Shields can also improve the AC of a character.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Damage (D)</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">is what happens to a character when an opponent attacks him successfully.
Damage can also occur as a result of poison, fire, falling, acid, and anything even
remotely dangerous in the real world. Damage from most attacks is measured in
hit points. Each time a character is hit, he suffers points of damage. It could
be as little as 1 point to as many as 80 or more. These points are subtracted
from the character's current hit point total. When this total reaches 0, the
character is dead.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Initiative</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> determines the order in which things happen in a combat round. Like so many
things in the world, initiative is determined by a combination of ability,
situation, and chance.
<P></P>
 At the start of each round of a battle, an initiative roll is made by both
sides. This roll can be modified by the abilities of the combatants and by the
situation. The person or side with the lower modified die roll acts first.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Melee</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> is any situation in which characters are battling each other hand-to-hand,
whether with fists, teeth, claws, swords, axes, pikes, or something else.
Strength and Dexterity are valuable assets in melee.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Missile combat</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">is defined as any time a weapon is shot, thrown, hurled, kicked, or otherwise
propelled. Missile and melee combat have the same basic rules, but there are
special situations and modifiers that apply only to missile combat.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Saving throws</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">are measures of a character's resistance to special types of attacks--poisons,
magic, and attacks that affect the whole body or mind of the character. The
ability to make successful saving throws improves as the character increases in
level.
<P></P>
<B> </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Surprise</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> can happen any time characters unexpectedly meet another group (monsters,
evil knights, peasants, etc.). Surprise is simply what happens when one side--a
person or party--is taken unawares, unable to react until they gather their wits.
Their opponents, if unsurprised, are allowed a bonus round of action while the
surprised characters recover. It's entirely possible for both sides in a given
situation to be surprised!
<P></P>
 Attacking with surprise gives bonuses to the attack roll (see <A HREF="DD00390.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00390.html">Table 35</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> ). A surprised character also has a decreased chance of rolling a successful
saving throw, if one is needed.
<P></P>
 Surprise is determined by a die roll and is normally checked at the beginning
of an encounter. Surprise is very unpredictable, so there are very few
modifiers to the roll.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>THAC0</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> is an acronym for &quot;To Hit Armor Class 0.&quot; This is the number a character,
NPC, or monster needs to attack an Armor Class 0 target successfully. THAC0
depends on a character's group and level or a monster's Hit Dice (see <A HREF="DD00396.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00396.html">Tables 37</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> -39). The THAC0 number can be used to calculate the number needed to hit any
Armor Class. THAC0 is refigured each time a character increases in level. Using
THAC0 speeds the play of combat greatly.
