 General alignments also can be applied to religions. The beliefs and practices
of the religion determine its alignment. A religion that espouses
understanding, working in harmony with others, and good deeds is more than likely lawful
good. those that stress the importance of individual perfection and purification
are probably chaotic good.
<P></P>
 It is expected that the priests of a religion will adhere to its alignment,
since they are supposed to be living examples of these beliefs. Other followers
of the religion need not adhere exactly to its alignment. If a person's
alignment is very different from his religion's, however, a priest is certainly
justified in wondering why that person adheres to a religion which is opposed to his
beliefs and philosophy.
