<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Water Breathing:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">It is 75% likely that a <I>water breathing</I> potion will contain two doses, 25% probable that there will be four in the
container. The potion allows the character drinking it to breathe normally in
liquids that contain suspended oxygen. This ability lasts for one full hour per
dose of potion quaffed, with an additional 1d10 rounds (minutes) variable. Thus,
a character who has consumed a water breathing potion could enter the depths of
a river, lake, or even the ocean and not drown while the magical effects of
the potion persisted.
