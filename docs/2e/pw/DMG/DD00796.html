<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ring of Mammal Control:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This ring enables its wearer to exercise complete control over mammals with
Intelligence of 4 or less (animal or semi-intelligent mammals). Up to 30 Hit Dice
of mammals can be controlled. The wearer's control over creatures is so great
he can even command them to kill themselves, but complete concentration is
required. (Note: The ring does not affect bird-mammal combinations, humans,
semi-humans, and monsters such as lammasu, shedu, manticores, etc.). If the DM is in
doubt about whether any creature can be controlled by the wearer of this ring,
assume it can't be controlled.
