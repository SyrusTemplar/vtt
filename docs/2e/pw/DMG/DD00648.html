 Aerial movement rates are handled according to the normal movement rules, with
clear sky being treated as clear terrain. A detailed system of aerial movement
during the round can be found in <A HREF="../PHB/DD01661.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01661.html">Chapter 9</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> : Combat. The only special consideration that must be given to aerial
movement is the weather condition. Weather is, for al practical purposes, the terrain
of the sky.
<P></P>
 As with sea movement, the weather for any particular occasion can be chosen by
the DM or determined randomly. If determined randomly, the DM should first
roll a wind condition (as found on <A HREF="DD00647.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00647.html">Table 79</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> , above).
<P></P>
 Next, the DM rolls 1d6 to determine precipitation (although storms and
hurricanes have automatic precipitation). During summer and winter, a 6 on the die
indicates rain or snow. In spring and fall, a 5 or 6 is rain. Clearly the DM must
adjust this according to the terrain of the region. There is little need to
make precipitation checks when flying over a desert, for example.
<P></P>
 Be aware that this is only a very simple method for determining the weather,
and judgment should still be used. The effects of weather on aerial movement can
be found on <A HREF="DD00649.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00649.html">Table 80</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> .
<P></P>
 These modifiers are cumulative. Thus strong winds and rain are the equivalent
of a storm, while a gale with rain is worse than a storm. Flight during a
hurricane is just about impossible without some type of magical protection.
