<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sweet Water:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This liquid is not actually a potion to be drunk (though it tastes good). <I>Sweet water</I> is added to other liquids in order to change them to pure, drinkable water.
It will neutralize poison and ruin magical potions (no saving throw). The
contents of a single container will change up to 100,000 cubic feet of polluted,
salt, or alkaline water to fresh water. It will turn up to 1,000 cubic feet of acid
into pure water. The effects of the potion are permanent, but the liquid may
be contaminated after an initial period of 5d4 rounds.
