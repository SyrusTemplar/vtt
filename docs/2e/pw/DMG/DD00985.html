<TITLE>Jewel of Flawlessness-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Jewel of Flawlessness:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This magical gem appears to be a very fine stone of some sort, but if magic is
detected for, its magical aura will be noted. When a <I>jewel of flawlessness</I> is placed with other gems, it doubles the likelihood of their being more
valuable (i.e., the chance for each stone going up in value increases from 10% to
20%). The jewel has from 10-100 facets, and whenever a gem increases in value
because of the magic of the <I>jewel of flawlessness</I> (a roll of 2 on d10), one of these facets disappears. When all are gone, the
jewel is a spherical stone that has no value.
