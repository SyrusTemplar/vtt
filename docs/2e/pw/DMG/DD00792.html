<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ring of Free Action:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This ring enables the wearer to move and attack freely and normally even when
attacked by a <I>web, hold,</I> or <I>slow</I> spell, or even while under water. The spells simply have no effect. While
under water, the individual moves at normal (surface) speed and does full damage
even with cutting weapons (like axes and scimitars) and with smashing weapons
(like flails, hammers, and maces), insofar as the weapon used is held rather than
hurled. This will not, however, enable breathing under water without further
appropriate magic.
