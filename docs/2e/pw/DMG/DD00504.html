 The players will often encounter situations in which it is important that a
stronghold be broken into. In these situations, the overall employment of siege
tactics should be secondary to the thrill and glory of the players going
&quot;mano-a-mano&quot; with their foes. In other words, the battle should be the background
against which the players act. Sixteen months of siege may be realistic, but it
isn't much fun!
<P></P>
 The critical point in a siege is that moment when the walls face a direct
assault. This is especially true in a role-playing adventure. The following table
simplifies this process of breaking down walls.
<P></P>
 To use the table, the DM determines what type of wall is being assaulted, and
its closest approximation on the Table. Cross-reference the type of attack
being made and roll 1D20. If the resulting roll is higher than the number required,
the attack does no significant damage; if the roll is lower, the wall begins
to give way.
<P></P>
 For each point below the required saving throw, the structure loses one cubic
foot of structure. For example, suppose a stone wall 10' thick fails its saving
throw by six points. The wall now loses a portion of its structure equal to
six cubic feet of area (i.e., a hole two feet wide, three feet high, and one foot
deep).
