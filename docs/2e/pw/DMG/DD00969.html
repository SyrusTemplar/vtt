<TITLE>Heward's Handy Haversack-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Heward's Handy Haversack:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A magical backpack of this sort appears quite ordinary—well-made and
well-used. It is of finely tanned leather, and the straps have brass hardware and
buckles. There are two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about
a quart of material, but each is similar to a <I>bag of holding</I> and will actually contain material equal to as much as two cubic feet in
volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up
to eight cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The pack has an even greater
power: When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item will always
be on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what
the haversack contains. <I>Heward's handy haversack</I> and whatever it contains gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws.
