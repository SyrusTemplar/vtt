<TITLE>Girdle of Femininity/Masculinity-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Girdle of Femininity/Masculinity:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This broad leather band appears to be a normal belt, but, if buckled on, it
will immediately change the sex of its wearer to the opposite gender. It then
loses all power. There is no sure way to restore the character's original sex,
although there is a 50% chance a <I>wish</I> might do so, and a powerful being can alter the situation. In other words, it
takes a godlike creature to set matters aright with certainty. Ten percent of
these girdles actually remove all sex from the wearer.
