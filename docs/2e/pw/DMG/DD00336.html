 You can automatically give the player character<I> read magic</I> and <I>detect magic</I> and four other spells of your choice. This starts all player characters off
with the same number of spells. While it is not necessary to give each character
the same spells, you should see that everyone has roughly the same balance of
power. No rolls to learn these spells need be made. The character is assumed to
have mastered them during his apprenticeship.
