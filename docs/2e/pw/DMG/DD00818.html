wizard) into itself. It then nullifies their effects and stores their potential
until the wielder releases this energy in the form of spells of his own casting.
The magic absorbed must have been directed at the character possessing the rod.
The wielder can instantly detect a spell's level as the rod absorbs the spell's
energy.
<P></P>
 A running total of absorbed (and used) spell levels should be kept. For
example, a rod that absorbs a 6th-level spell and a 3rd-level spell has a total of
nine absorbed levels. The wielder of the rod can use captured spell energy to
cast any spell he has memorized, at a casting time of 1, without loss of spell
memory. The only restriction is that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod
must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the wielder wants to
cast. Continuing the example above, the rod-wielder could cast a maximum of one
9th-level spell, one 6th-level and one 3rd-level, and so on.
<P></P>
 The <I>rod of absorption</I> can never be recharged. It absorbs 50 spell levels and can thereafter only
discharge any remaining potential it might have. The wielder will know that the
rod's limit has been reached upon grasping the item. Used charges indicate that
it has already absorbed some of its maximum of 50 spell levels and that some of
those have been used.
<P></P>
 Here is a more specific example: A priest uses a <I>rod of absorption</I> to nullify the effect of a <I>hold person</I> spell cast at him by a mage. The rod has now absorbed three spell levels and
can absorb 47 more. The cleric can cast any 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell he
has memorized, without memory loss of that spell, by using the stored potential
of the rod. Assume the cleric casts a <I>hold person</I> back. This spell is only 2nd-level to him, so the rod still holds one spell
level of potential, can absorb 47 more, and has disposed of two charges
permanently.
