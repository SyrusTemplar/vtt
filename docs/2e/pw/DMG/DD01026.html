<TITLE>Portable Hole-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Portable Hole:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A portable hole is a circle of magical cloth spun from the webs of a phase
spider interwoven with strands of ether and beams of Astral plane luminaries. When
opened fully, a portable hole is 6 feet in diameter, but it can be folded as
small as a pocket handkerchief. When spread upon any surface, it causes an
extra-dimensional hole 10 feet deep to come into being. This hole can be &quot;picked up&quot;
from inside or out by simply taking hold of the edges of the magical cloth and
folding it up. Either way, the entrance disappears, but anything inside the
hole remains.
<P></P>
 The only oxygen in the hole is that allowed by creation of the space, so
creatures requiring the gas cannot remain inside for more than a turn or so without
opening the space again by means of the magical cloth. The cloth does not
accumulate weight even if its hole is filled (with gold, for example). Each <I>portable hole</I> opens on its own particular nondimensional space. If a <I>bag of holding</I> is placed within a <I>portable hole,</I> a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space, and the bag and the cloth
are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a <I>portable hole</I> is placed within a <I>bag of holding,</I> it opens a gate to another plane, and the hole, bag, and any creatures within
a 10-foot radius are drawn to the Astral Plane, the <I>portable hole</I> and <I>bag of holding</I> being destroyed in the process.
