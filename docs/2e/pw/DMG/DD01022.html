<TITLE>Pipes of Haunting-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Pipes of Haunting:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This magical item appears to be a small set of pan pipes. If checked, it
faintly radiates magic. When played by a person skilled in music, the pipes create
an eerie, spell-binding tune. A listener will think the source of the music is
somewhere within 30 feet of the musician. Those hearing the tune and not aware
of the piper must make a saving throw vs. spell. Those who fail become nervous
and scared. All morale checks are made with a -2 penalty and the listeners
suffer a -1 penalty to all surprise rolls.
