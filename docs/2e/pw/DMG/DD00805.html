<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ring of Sustenance:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This magical ring provides its wearer with life-sustaining nourishment even
though he or she might go for days without food or drink. The ring also refreshes
the body and mind, so that its wearer needs to sleep only two hours per day to
gain the benefit of eight hours of sleep.
<P></P>
 The ring must be worn for a full week in order to function properly. If it is
removed, the wearer immediately loses its benefit and must wear it for another
week to reattune it to himself. After functioning for any period of seven
consecutive days, a <I>ring of sustenance</I> will cease to function for a week while it replenishes itself.
