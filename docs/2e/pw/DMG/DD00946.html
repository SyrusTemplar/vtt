<TITLE>Flask of Curses-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Flask of Curses:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This item looks like an ordinary beaker, bottle, container, decanter, flask,
or jug. It has magical properties, but detection will not reveal the nature of
the <I>flask of curses.</I> It may contain a liquid or it may emit smoke. When the flask is first
unstoppered, a <I>curse</I> of some sort will be visited upon the person or persons nearby. After that,
it is harmless. The type of <I>curse</I> is up to the DM. Suggestions include the reverse of the priest's <I>bless</I> spell. Typical curses found on scrolls are recommended for use here as well.
Or perhaps a monster could appear and attack all creatures in sight.
