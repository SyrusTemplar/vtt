</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> More than other methods of travel, ships (especially sailing ships) are
subject to the whims of wind and weather. While it can be assumed that sailing
weather is normally good, there are times when storms, favorable winds, or freak
currents can increase or decrease a ship's speed. The effects of different weather
conditions are listed on <A HREF="DD00646.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00646.html">Table 78</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> .

 Weather conditions are generally fairly consistent within a single day. (This
is an obvious simplification to keep the game moving.) The exact conditions for
a given day can be chosen by the DM (perhaps by using the weather outside) or
it can be determined randomly. To do the latter, roll 2d6 and find the result
on <A HREF="DD00647.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00647.html">Table 79</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> .
<P></P>
<B> </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Adverse winds</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">are determined by rolling 1d6. On a 5 or 6, the winds are unfavorable. When
adverse winds are storm strength or greater, the ship will be blown off-course by
at least half its movement under those conditions, regardless of whether it is
a sailing ship or galley.
