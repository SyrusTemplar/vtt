<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Dust of Appearance:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This fine powder appears like any other dust unless a careful examination is
conducted. This will reveal it to be a very fine, very light, metallic dust. A
single handful of this substance flung into the air will coat all objects,
making them visible even if they are invisible, out of phase, astral, or ethereal.
Note that the dust will also reveal mirror images and projected images for what
they are, and it likewise negates the effects of <I>cloaks of displacement</I> or <I>elvenkind</I> and <I>robes of blending.</I> The dust's effect lasts for 2d10 turns.
<P></P>
 <I>Dust of appearance</I> is typically stored in small silk packets or hollow bone blow tubes. A packet
can be shaken out to cover an area with a radius of 10 feet from the user. A
tube can be blown in a cone shape, 1 foot wide at the start, 15 feet at the end,
and 20 feet long. As few as 5 or as many as 50 containers may be found in one
place.
