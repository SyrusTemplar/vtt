<TITLE>Hat of Stupidity-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Hat of Stupidity:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This hat is indistinguishable from any other magical hat, even when most
carefully detected by magical means. Only by placing it upon the head can its powers
be determined. Of course, once on the head, the wearer will believe that the
hat is a beneficial item, for he will be overcome by stupidity. Intelligence is
lowered to 7, or by -1 if the wearer has a 7 or lower Intelligence normally.
The wearer will always desire to have the hat on—especially when he is engaged in
any activity which requires thinking, spellcasting, etc. Without the benefit
of a <I>remove curse</I> spell or similar magic, the wearer will never be free from the magic of the
hat. If released, the wearer's Intelligence returns to its normal level.
