</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Pouch of Accessibility:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This normal-seeming pouch is actually a strongly magicked item which can
contain up to 300 lbs. in 30 specially constructed pockets within it. Each pocket,
in turn, holds a maximum of 10 lbs., or one cubic foot of volume, whichever is
reached first.
<P></P>
 This device also enables the possessor to open it and call forth the item(s)
desired. Merely speaking the name of a desired object causes it to appear at the
top of the pouch, ready for instant grasp.
<P></P>
 These items are similar to <I>bags of holding</I> and <I>portable holes,</I> and the strictures about placement within such magical spaces apply fully.
The pouch weighs 1 lb. empty and 4 lbs. when filled.
