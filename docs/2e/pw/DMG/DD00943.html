<TITLE>Eyes of Minute Seeing-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Eyes of Minute Seeing:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">In appearance, <I>eyes of minute seeing</I> are much like other magical lenses, but they enable the wearer to see 100
times better at distances of 1 foot or less. Thus, tiny seams, minute marks, even
the impression left from writing can be seen. Secret compartments and hidden
joints can be noted and the information acted upon. The effect of wearing just
one of these crystals is the same as that given for <I>eyes of the eagle.</I>
