<TITLE>Dust of Disappearance-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Dust of Disappearance:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This dust looks just like <I>dust of appearance,</I> and it is typically stored in the same manner and quantity. All things
touched by it reflect and bend light of all sorts (infrared and ultraviolet
included), becoming invisible. Normal sight can't see dusted creatures or objects, nor
can they be detected by any normal detection or even magical means. Even <I>detect invisibility</I> spells don't work. <I>Dust of appearance,</I> however, does reveal people and objects made invisible by <I>dust of disappearance.</I>
<P></P>
 Invisibility bestowed by the dust lasts for 2d10 turns (1d10+10 if sprinkled
carefully upon an object). Attack while thus invisible is possible, always by
surprise if the opponent fails to note the invisible thing and always at an Armor
Class 4 better than normal (while invisibility lasts). Unlike the <I>invisibility</I> spell, <I>dust of disappearance</I> remains effective even after an attack is made.
