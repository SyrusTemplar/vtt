 Although the term &quot;<A HREF="../PHB/DD01648.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01648.html">school</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> &quot; is used throughout the<I> Player's Handbook</I> and this book there are no rules to explain any formal structures or
institutions. There is no hard and fast definition of a necromantic school. There may
or may not be such a school in the campaign. This choice is left to individual
DMs.
<P></P>
 One possibility is that wizards learn their specialties without formal
training. Materros the Necromancer has a natural curiosity about necromantic spells,
so he specializes in them.
<P></P>
 Another possibility is that there are formal colleges or academies where
spells are taught. These institutions would have their own hierarchies, traditions,
regulations, and procedures.
<P></P>
 For example, Materros the Necromancer could be a brother of the Cabal of
Thar-Zad, a necromantic society. As a sign of his standing high within its
hierarchy, he is allowed to wear the red and green robes of a master. Of course, when he
wears these, his occupation is easily identified by those who know something
of the Cabal. This is not all bad, since the Cabal of Thar-Zad has a reputation
as a dangerous and mean bunch. By adding such details, the DM brings his
campaign to life. He can make a seemingly limited magical school more appealing to
players.
