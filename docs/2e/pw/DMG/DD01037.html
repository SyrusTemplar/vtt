<TITLE>Robe of Vermin-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Robe of Vermin:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This magical-seeming garment will radiate a dim aura of enchantment if magic
is detected for. The wearer will notice nothing unusual when the robe is donned,
and it will actually convey some magical power at that time—<I>protection +1,</I> for example. However, as soon as the wearer is in a situation requiring
concentration and action against hostile opponents, the true nature of the garment
will be revealed: The wearer immediately suffers a multitude of bites from the
insects that magically infest the garment. He must cease all other activities in
order to scratch, shift the robe, and generally show signs of extreme
discomfort from the movement and biting of these pests.
<P></P>
 The wearer is unable to gain initiative, and has a 50% chance of being unable
to complete a spell due to the vermin. All other actions and attack forms
requiring manual/locomotive/somatic activity are at half normal probability. The
garment can't be removed except by means of a <I>remove curse</I> spell or similar magic.
