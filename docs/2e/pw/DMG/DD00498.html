 Poison complicates this situation. A character who dies as a result of
poisoning still could have active venom in his system.
<P></P>
 Poisons remain effective for 2d6 hours after the death of the victim. If the
character is raised during this time, some method must be found to neutralize
the poison before the character is restored to life. If this is not done, then
after the character rolls the resurrection survival check given in &quot;Raising the
Dead,&quot; he must immediately roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or suffer
all the effects of the poison in his body, as per the normal rules.
<P></P>
 This may only injure some characters, but it may kill other characters seconds
after being raised!
