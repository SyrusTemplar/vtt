<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Broom of Flying:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This magical broom is able to fly through the air at up to 30 base movement
speed. The broom can carry 182 pounds at this rate, but every 14 additional
pounds slows movement by 1. The device can climb or dive at an angle of 30 degrees.
A command word (determined by the DM) must be used. The broom will travel alone
to any destination named. It will come to its owner from as far away as 300
yards when he speaks the command word.
