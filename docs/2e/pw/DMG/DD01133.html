<TITLE>Trident of Submission-- Magical Weapon (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Trident of Submission:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> A weapon of this nature appears unremarkable, exactly as any normal trident.
The wielder of a <I>trident of submission</I> causes any opponent struck to save vs. spell. If the opponent fails to save,
it must check morale the next round <I>instead</I> of attacking; if morale is good, the opponent may act normally next round,
but if it is poor, the opponent will cease fighting and surrender, overcome with
a feeling of hopelessness. The duration of this hopelessness is 2-8 rounds.
Thereafter the creature is normal once again. The trident has 17-20 charges. A
trident of this type is a +1 magical weapon.
