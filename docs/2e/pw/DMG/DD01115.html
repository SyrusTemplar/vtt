<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sword +1, cursed:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This performs in all respects as a +1 weapon, but when its wielder is faced by
an enemy, the sword will weld itself to the character's hand and force him to
fight until the enemy or the wielder is slain. Thereafter, the possessor can
loose, but never rid himself of, the cursed sword. No matter what is done, it
will appear in his hand whenever an opponent is faced. The character can be freed
of the weapon only by a <I>remove curse</I> spell.
