<TITLE>Iron Bands of Bilarro-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Iron Bands of Bilarro:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">When initially discovered, this very potent item will appear to be a rusty
iron sphere. Close examination will reveal that there are bandings on the
three-inch-diameter globe. Magic detection will reveal strong magic of an indeterminate
nature.
<P></P>
 When the proper command word is spoken and the spherical iron device is hurled
at an opponent, the bands expand and tightly constrict the target creature if
a successful, unadjusted attack roll is made. A single creature of up to
frost/fire giant-size can be captured thus and held immobile until the command word
is spoken to bring the bands into globular form again. Any creature captured in
the bands, however, gets the chance to break (and ruin) the bands by
successfully <I>bending bars.</I> Only one attempt is possible before the bands are so set as to be inescapable.
<P></P>
