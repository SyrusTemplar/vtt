<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Staff of Slinging:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This magical quarterstaff appears to be a +1 weapon unless it is grasped by a
druid, whereupon its power of slinging becomes evident. This power, which can
be employed <I>only</I> by a druid, is activated when one end of the staff is touched to a heavy
object of roughly spherical shape (a stone, metal ball, pottery crock, etc.) of up
to nine inches in diameter and five pounds in weight. The object adheres to the
end of the staff, and the wielder need then only swing the staff in an
overhand arc to release the missile toward a desired target.
<P></P>
 The missile leaves the staff on the downstroke of the overhand swing and
travels in a low, rising trajectory, with the missile going one foot upward for
every 10 feet traveled. Of course, the arc may be higher, or the missile aimed so
as to travel nearly vertically. (In the latter case, reverse the arcing ratio so
that one foot of distance laterally is covered for every 10 feet of vertical
rise.) The maximum range of such a missile is 180 feet, with limits of 60 feet
and 120 feet on short and medium range, respectively.
<P></P>
 This staff also carries charges, and a druid wielding the item can expend one
charge and thereby use the staff to hurl a missile of large size, as if the
wielder were a stone giant (range out to 300 feet, 3d10 points of damage per hit).
Whether used as a magical quarterstaff or by employing one of its slinging
powers, the staff bestows +1 to the wielder's attack roll and +1 per die to damage
dealt out. The weapon may be recharged by a druid of 12th or higher level.
