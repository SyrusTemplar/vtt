 Once a character is wounded, his player will naturally want to get him healed.
Characters can heal either by natural or magical means. Natural healing is
slow, but it's available to all characters. Magical healing may or may not be
available, depending on the presence of spellcasters or magical devices. Healing
can never restore more hit points to a character than his maximum hit point total.
