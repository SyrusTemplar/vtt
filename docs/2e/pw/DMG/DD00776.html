<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Protection from Plants:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">(Reading time—1 round). A protective sphere 10 feet in diameter is centered on
the reader. All forms of vegetable life (including fungi, slimes, molds, and
the like) are unable to penetrate the sphere. If it is moved toward plant life
that is capable of movement, the plant will be pushed away. If the plant is
immobile (a well-rooted shrub, bush, or tree, for instance), the sphere cannot be
moved through or past it unless the reader has enough strength and mass to
uproot the plant under normal conditions. The protection lasts for 1d4+4 turns.
