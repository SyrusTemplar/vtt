<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ventriloquism:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This allows the user to make his voice sound as if it (or someone's voice or a
similar sound) were issuing from someplace other than where he is—from another
creature, a statue, from behind a door, down a passage, etc. The user can
speak in any language he knows, or make any sound he can normally make. To detect
the ruse, listeners must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell with a penalty
of -2. If cast in conjunction with other illusions, the DM may rule greater
penalties or disallow an independent saving throw against this effect—the
combined illusion may be perfect! The imbiber can use the <I>ventriloquism</I> ability up to six times within the duration of the potion.
