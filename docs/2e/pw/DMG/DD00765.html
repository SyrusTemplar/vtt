 While not magical, maps are special enough to require careful preparation and
use by the DM, hence they are included in the listings of magical items. Maps
should rarely be given out randomly—the DM must have a suitable map prepared in
advance. There is no table to govern the nature of maps. All hint at or imply
the existence of great treasures to be found while giving only a vague idea of
the risks to be overcome. Some may be genuine, others fake. Because of the wide
range of possibilities, the DM should use treasure maps as the springboard for
new and exciting adventures.
