However, feet and walking are not the only ways a character can get
around. In the AD&amp;D game world, characters can ride horses, bounce along on
camels, sail aboard ships, and even fly winged mounts. Clearly there are many
different forms of conveyance, the most common of which are covered here.

 In addition, there are hazards and risks that must be considered when
traveling. Player characters can get lost in untracked wildernesses, capsize in
cascading rapids, or run aground on hidden shoals. Getting around can be a risky
business.
