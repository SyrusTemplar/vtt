The javelin has a +6 bonus to attack rolls and inflicts 1d6+6 points of damage.
(Note this missile will fly horizontally, vertically, or any combination
thereof to the full extent of its range.) From 2-8 (2d4) will be found at one time.
The magic of the <I>javelin of piercing</I> is good for only one throw after which it becomes a normal javelin.
