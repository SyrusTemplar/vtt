<TITLE>Darts of Homing-- Magical Weapon (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Darts of Homing:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">These appear to be normal projectiles, but are actually +3 magical weapons. If
a dart hits the intended target, it will magically return to the thrower in
the same round and can be re-used. A dart inflicts a base 1d6 points of damage
plus its magical bonus on a successful hit against any size creature (4-9 points
total). A dart that misses its target loses its magical power. These weapons
have twice the range of ordinary darts—20 yards short, 40 yards medium, 80 yards
long.
