<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Longevity:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The <I>longevity</I> potion reduces the character's age by 1d12 years, restoring youth and vigor.
The entire potion must be consumed to achieve the desired result. It is also
useful as a counter to magical or monster-based aging attacks.
<P></P>
 Each time one drinks a <I>longevity</I> potion, there is a 1% cumulative chance the effect will be the reverse of
what the consumer wants—all age removed by previous drinks will be restored!
