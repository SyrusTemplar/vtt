</B> The AD&amp;D combat system does not call for specific wounds--scars, broken bones,
missing limbs, and the like. And in most cases they shouldn't be applied.
Remember that this is a game of heroic fantasy. If characters were to suffer
real-life effects from all their battles and combats, they would quickly be some of
the sorriest and most depressing characters in the campaign world.
<P></P>
 It's hard to get excited when your character is recovering from a broken leg
and a dislocated shoulder suffered in a fall off a 15-foot wall. It is not
recommended that characters suffer specific injuries. In general, stick with the
basic pool of hit points.
