 While the character discussion above provides a structure for adventurers in
the game, your own campaign might be quite different. For example, there is no
rule that says mages can't form strong guilds. Such a group would have a
profound impact on the campaign world, however. With their magical might, they could
control virtually any facet of life they chose--politics, trade, class
structure, even private behavior. Such a group would alter the amount of magic in your
campaign and who possessed it.
<P></P>
 Organized mages might even attempt to limit the activities of those who
present a threat to their power, such as adventurers. Whenever you alter the balance
of the character classes, be sure you consider what the changes could do to
your campaign.
