<TITLE>Girdle of Many Pouches-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Girdle of Many Pouches:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This broad waistbelt seems to be nothing more than a well-made article of
dress. However, if magic is detected for, the item will radiate strong enchantment
along with a fainter aura of alteration.
<P></P>
 Examination will reveal that the girdle has eight small pouches on its inner
front surface. In fact, there are a total of 64 magical pouches in the girdle,
seven others &quot;behind'' each of the eight apparent ones. Each of these pouches is
similar to a miniature <I>bag of holding,</I> able to contain up to one cubic foot of material weighing as much as 10
pounds. The girdle responds to the thoughts of its wearer by providing a full pouch
(to extract something from) or an empty one (to put something in) as desired.
Naturally, this item is greatly prized by spellcasters, for it will hold
components for many spells and make them readily available.
