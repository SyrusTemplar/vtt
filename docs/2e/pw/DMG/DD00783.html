<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Ring of Blinking:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">When the wearer of this ring issues the proper verbal command, the item
activates, and he is affected as if a <I>blink</I> spell were operating upon his person. The effect lasts for six rounds. The
ring then ceases to function for six turns (one hour) while it replenishes
itself. The command word is usually engraved somewhere on the ring. The ring will
activate whenever this word is spoken, even though the command might be given by
someone other than the wearer, provided that the word is spoken within 10 feet
of the ring.
