<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Spade of Colossal Excavation:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This digging tool is 8 feet long with a spade-like blade 2 feet wide and 3
feet long. Any fighter with 18 Strength can use this magical shovel to dig great
holes. One cubic yard of normal earth can be excavated in one round. After 10
rounds of digging, the user must rest for five rounds. Hard pan clay takes twice
as long to dig, as does gravel. Loose soil takes only half as long.
