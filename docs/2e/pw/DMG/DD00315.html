 When you set your campaign in a specific time period, you might want to adjust
the equipment lists to reflect changes in availability and price. Some
suggested changes are listed in <A HREF="DD00314.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00314.html">Table 23</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> . Like the capsule descriptions, the table is not 100% accurate. Instead, it
reflects whether items were commonly used in the time period. For example,
flails (as an agricultural instrument) have existed for time immemorial. However,
they were not commonly used as weapons in most time periods, except in cases of
emergency. By doing further research, you can refine and expand this list.
