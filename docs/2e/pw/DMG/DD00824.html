<TITLE>Rod of Passage (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Rod of Passage:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This potent item allows its wielder to perform any of the following, one at a
time, one per round: <I>astral travel, dimension door, passwall, phase door,</I> and <I>teleport without error.</I> It is necessary to expend one charge to activate the rod, but once it is
activated the possessor can perform each of the listed functions one time. The rod
remains charged for one day, or until each of the five functions is used. None
of the functions can be used a second time unless another charge is expended,
whereupon all five of the functions again become available.
<P></P>
 With respect to <I>astral travel,</I> the wielder can elect to use the rod on as many as five creatures (one of
which must be the wielder himself). Each creature then takes on astral form and
can travel in that form. Any remaining functions of the rod are cancelled by this
action. The rod travels into the Astral plane along with the wielder and the
other affected creatures, and cannot be used or reactivated until it is returned
from the Astral plane.
<P></P>
 This five-in-one effect doesn't work with respect to the rod's other powers;
only <I>astral travel</I> can be used more than once per activation, and only in the manner described
above.
<P></P>
 The rod exudes a magical aura of the alteration and evocation sort. Because
the physical bodies of the travelers, and their possessions, are actually
empowered to become astral, the recharging of the rod requires a wizard of 20th level
or higher.
<P></P>
