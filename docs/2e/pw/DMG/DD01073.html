<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Armor of Command:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This finely crafted plate mail radiates a powerful aura of magic. When worn,
the armor bestows a dignified and commanding aura upon its owner. The wearer is
treated as if he had a Charisma of 18 for all encounter reactions. Friendly
troops within 360 feet of the user have their morale increased by +2. Otherwise,
the armor functions as <I>plate mail +1.</I> Since the effect arises in great part from the distinctiveness of the armor,
the wearer cannot hide or conceal himself in any way and still have the effect
function.
