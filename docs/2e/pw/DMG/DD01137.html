 Tables 113 through 119 should be used to determine the properties of an
intelligent weapon: the number of powers, unusual properties, alignment, and special
purpose of the item (if any). Such weapons are useful to give higher-level
fighters some additional tactical options and limited-use special abilities.
<P></P>
 The DM is encouraged to design unusual magical weapons along special themes
and for specific campaign purposes, using the tables as guidelines and for
inspiration. Just because a power is rolled doesn't mean it must be given out. If the
DM feels a combination is too bizarre or powerful, he can simply change or
ignore it.

 The first step in creating an intelligent weapon is to determine its general
capabilities. These are found by rolling 1d100 on <A HREF="DD01138.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01138.html">Table 113</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> .
