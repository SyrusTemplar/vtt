 At the heart of the combat system is the attack roll. This is the die roll
that determines whether an attack succeeds or fails. The number a player needs to
make a successful attack roll is also called the &quot;to-hit&quot; number. 
<P></P>
 Attack rolls are used for attacks with swords, bows, rocks, and other weapons,
as well as blows from fists, tackling, and various hand-to-hand attacks.
Attack rolls are also used to resolve a variety of actions that require accuracy
(e.g., throwing a rock at a small target or tossing a sword to a party member in
the middle of a fight).
