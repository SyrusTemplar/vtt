 Many DMs make use of a dual arrangement for preparing encounters. First they
prepare a key, describing the appearance of the encounter locations, items in
them, and other things that are relatively non-changing. Then they write triggers
focusing on the characters and the actions.
<P></P>
 When they need to describe a room, they rely on the key, while the trigger
describes the plot of the adventure. Although this requires a little more set-up,
this allows different events to happen in the same place or area, giving a
feeling of continuity to the adventure and campaign.
