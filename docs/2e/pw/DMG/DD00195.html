</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> This method gives players better scores without introducing serious ability
inflation. It also gives them more control over their characters. The average
ability is still in the 9 to 12 range, and players can manipulate their results to
bring the characters they create closer to the ideal characters they imagine.
<P></P>
 Exceptional player characters are still rare, and unusual character classes
are still uncommon, but few characters will have below-average scores.

roll. Despite the improved choices, a character might still not be eligible for
the race or class the player wants.
