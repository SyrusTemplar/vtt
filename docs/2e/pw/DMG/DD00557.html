 Any time the DM feels his adventure is dragging along or that characters are
getting over-confident, he can declare a random encounter. Likewise if he feels
that a random encounter would hurt the adventure, he can ignore one that's
called for. Good judgment and story considerations are more important than slavish
devotion to procedure.
