 As exciting and important as money is for player characters, tracing
day-to-day expenses just isn't very interesting. Forcing players to record every
purchase their characters make is time-consuming and, plainly put, not very heroic.
It's better simply to charge player characters a monthly living expense.
<P></P>
 This living expense covers all normal room and board charges whenever a
character is operating out of his home base. Separate charges for meals and beds need
be made only when the character is traveling away from home.
<P></P>
 Players describe how well (or poorly) they want their characters to live. From
this the DM decides if they are living in squalid, poor, middle-class, or
wealthy surroundings. The Player Character Living Expenses table, below, gives
estimated base costs for each category.
<P></P>
 Squalid and poor living conditions cost the same for all characters regardless
of race or level. However, as a character increases in level, his needs
increase according to (or beyond) his means. Characters living middle-class or
wealthy lifestyles multiply the base living expense by their level to determine the
cost. Characters of races other than the predominant one of the area (e.g.,
dwarves in a human city or humans in an elven village) pay double the normal rate.
This is due to suspicion and a scarcity of goods the character is accustomed to.
<P></P>
 The only direct game effect of living conditions is the expense involved, but
living conditions can also determine some role-playing events and conditions in
your game. Your player characters' lifestyles even can be used as a starting
point for many different types of adventures.
