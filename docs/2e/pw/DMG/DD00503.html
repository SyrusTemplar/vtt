 Although most adventurers spend most of their time on foot, and on good old
solid land where common sense and the normal combat rules can be applied, the
player characters are operating in a fantasy world.
<P></P>
 Sooner or later, player characters are going to lay siege to a castle, or leap
on their horses, or learn how to ride an exotic flying creature. Eventually,
they're going to pick up and go adventuring in some totally weird environment
where the normal laws of physics just don't apply. Here, you'll find rules and
guidelines for some ordinary, and not so ordinary combat situations.
