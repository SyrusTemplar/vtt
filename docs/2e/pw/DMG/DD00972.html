<TITLE>Horn of Collapsing-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Horn of Collapsing:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The horn appears to be a normal musical instrument, perhaps a bugle or warning
horn of some sort. If it is sounded improperly (e.g., without first speaking
the proper command word) or 10% of the time in any event, the following will
result:
<P></P>
 <I>Out-of-doors:</I> A torrent of fist-sized rocks will strike the individual sounding the horn,
2d6 in number, each causing 1d6 hit points of damage.
<P></P>
 <I>Indoors:</I> The ceiling overhead will collapse when the device is blown. The character
suffers 3d12 points of damage.
<P></P>
 <I>Underground:</I> The area immediately above the character sounding the horn will fall upon
him. The damage is 5d4 points base, multiplied by one for each 10 feet of height
which the material above drops (i.e., twice damage if a 20-foot ceiling, three
times damage if a 30-foot ceiling, etc.).
<P></P>
 Proper use of a <I>horn of collapsing</I> enables the character to sound it while it is pointed at the roof overhead
from 30 to 60 feet beyond the user. The effect is to collapse a section of roof
up to 20 feet wide and 20 feet long (10-foot radius from the central aiming
point) which inflicts damage as noted above if indoors or underground only.
