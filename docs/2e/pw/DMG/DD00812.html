request. If players are greedy and grasping, interpret their wording exactly,
twist the wording, or simply rule the request is beyond the power of the magic. In
any case, the wish is used up, whether or not the wish was granted, and
regardless of the DM's interpretation of the wisher's request. No wish can cancel the
decrees of god-like beings, unless it comes from another such creature.
