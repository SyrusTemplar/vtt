 Encounters are the heart of the AD&amp;D game. And since encounters with monsters
and NPCs often lead to combat, an understanding of what happens during battles
is vital. There are several factors the DM will consider in any combat, most of
which arise from the circumstances of the encounter. Is anyone surprised? How
far apart are the opponents? How many of them are there? Answers to these
questions are found in <A HREF="DD00536.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00536.html">Chapter 11:</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Encounters. These are questions common to all encounters, whether combat
occurs.
