<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sword -2, cursed:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This is a sword that gives off a magical aura and performs well against
targets in practice, but when it is used against an opponent in combat it lowers its
user's attack rolls by -2. Only by careful observation can this lowering be
detected.
<P></P>
 All damage scored is reduced by 2 hit points, but never below a 1 in any
event. The sword will always force the character to employ it against enemies,
appearing in the character's hand. It can be gotten rid of only by means of <I>limited wish</I> or <I>wish.</I>
