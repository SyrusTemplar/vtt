 A rod is normally activated when the wielder utters a specific command word.
This word acts like a trigger, unleashing the power stored within the item.
Since control of a rod depends on knowledge of the command word, these are
jealously guarded by the owner. An absent-minded wizard can etch the command word on
the item or carry it on a piece of paper in his pocket, but this is only rarely
done. Most often the character must use spells of the divination school or sages
to discover the correct command to activate a rod.
