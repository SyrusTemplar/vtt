 The color of a <I>robe of the archmagi</I> is not determined until it is donned by a wizard. If a white robe is donned
by an evil wizard, he suffers 11d4+7 points of damage and loses 18,000-51,000
experience points at the DM's discretion. The reverse is true with respect to a
black robe donned by a good aligned wizard. An evil or good wizard putting on a
gray robe, or a neutral wizard donning either a white or black robe, incurs 6d4
points damage, 6,000-24,000 experience points loss, and the wearer will be
moved toward the alignment of the robe by its enchantments (i.e., he will feel
himself urged to change alignment to that of the robe, and he will have to make an
effort to maintain his old alignment).
