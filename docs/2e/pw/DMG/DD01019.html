<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Phylactery of Faithfulness:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">There is no means to determine what function this device performs until it is
worn. The wearer of a <I>phylactery of faithfulness</I> will be aware of any action or item that will adversely affect his alignment
and standing with his deity. He acquires this information prior to performing
the action or becoming associated with such an item, if a moment is taken to
contemplate the action. The phylactery must be worn normally by the priest, of
course.
