</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sword of the Planes:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This magical weapon has a base bonus of +1 on the Prime Material Plane, but on
any Inner Plane its bonus increases to +2. (The +2 bonus also applies on the
Prime Material Plane when the weapon is used against <I>opponents</I> from the Inner Planes.) Similarly, when used on an Outer Plane or against
creatures from the Outer Planes, the sword becomes a +3 weapon. Finally, it
operates as a +4 weapon on the Astral or Ethereal Plane or when used against
opponents from either of those planes.
