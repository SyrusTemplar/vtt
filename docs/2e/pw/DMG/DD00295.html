 Vigorous trade was done in goods. Grain, cattle, sheep, wool, jewelry,
foodstuffs, and cloth were all items of value. A canny Venetian merchant would sail
from Venice to England with a load of silks, trading it there for good English
wool (making sure he made a profit), and return to Venice to sell the wool for
another load of goods for England.
