<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Manual of Quickness of Action:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The heavy covers and metal bindings of this compilation will not distinguish
it from other semi-valuable, nonmagical texts. This work contains secret
formulae that enable a single reader to assimilate the text (three days of
uninterrupted study) and then practice the skills detailed therein.
<P></P>
 If this practice is faithfully done for one month, the character will gain one
point of Dexterity. The manual will disappear immediately after reading, but
the contents will be remembered for three months. However, the reader will not
be able to articulate or otherwise record the information he retains. Only after
the month of training will the Dexterity bonus be gained. Further perusal of a
similar text will not add to the same character's Dexterity.
