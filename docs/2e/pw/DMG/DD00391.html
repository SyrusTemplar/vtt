 Not all weapons perform the same. If they did, there would be no need for the
wide variety of weapons that exist. Only one form of each weapon-type, the most
useful one, would be used throughout the world. This is obviously not the case.
<P></P>
 Aside from the differences in size, weight, length, and shape, certain types
of weapons are more useful against some types of armor than others. Indeed, the
different armors and weapons of the world are the result of an ancient arms
race. Every new weapon led to the development of a new type of armor designed to
counter it. This led to new weapons, which led to new armor, and so on.
