<TITLE>Universal Solvent-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Universal Solvent:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This strange and magical liquid appears to be some sort of minor oil or
potion. Upon first examination, it seems to have the properties of both <I>oil of slipperiness</I> and a potion of <I>delusion.</I> However, if it is applied to any form of adhesive or sticky material, the
solution will immediately dissolve it. Thus, for instance, the effect of <I>sovereign glue</I> will immediately be negated by this liquid, as will any other form of cement,
glue, or adhesive. The area of effect of this liquid is one cubic foot per
ounce, and a typical container holds 27 ounces.
<P></P>
 If the liquid is carefully distilled to bring it down to one-third of its
original volume, each ounce will dissolve one cubic foot of organic or inorganic
material, just as if a <I>disintegrate</I> spell had been employed. To find if a target is affected by this concentrated
solution, a normal attack roll is required, and the subject is entitled to a
saving throw vs. spell. Inanimate objects are automatically affected by the
solution, although if they are magical, a saving throw vs. disintegrate applies.
