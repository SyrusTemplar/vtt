 If at all possible, start characters at 1st level. The lowest character levels
are like the early years of childhood. What happens to a character during
these first adventures will do much to determine how that character will be
role-played. Did Rath the Dwarf save the day by fool-hardily charging into battle when
he was a mere 1st level? If he did, the odds are good the player will try it
again and will begin to play Rath as a bold and reckless fellow.
<P></P>
 On the other hand, if Rath was clobbered the first few times he rushed in, the
player would begin to play Rath as a cautious, prudent fellow. Even the
smallest events can have a great effect on low-level characters, so these events
sharply etch the behavior of the character. Deny the player these beginning levels
and you are stripping him of the opportunity to develop his character's
personality.
