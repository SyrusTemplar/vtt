<TITLE>Mirror of Life Trapping-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Mirror of Life Trapping:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This crystal device is usually about 4 square feet in area, framed in metal,
wood, etc. It is usable only by wizards, although it can be affixed to a surface
to operate alone by giving a command word. A mirror has from 13 to 18
nonspatial/extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet
of the device and looking at its reflection must successfully save vs. spell or
be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the
nature of the device will always see its reflection, the probability dropping
to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror traps life.
<P></P>
 When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a
factor, but automatons and nonliving matter (including golems but excluding
intelligent undead) are not trapped. The possessor of the mirror can call the
reflection of any creature that is trapped within to the surface of the mirror, and
the powerless creature can be engaged in conversation. If mirror capacity is
exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) will be set free in order to
accommodate the latest one.
<P></P>
 If the mirror is broken, all victims are freed (usually to then attack the
possessor of the device). Note that the possessor of a <I>mirror of life trapping</I> can speak a command word to free a trapped creature, but the creature's cell
must be known. Example: &quot;In the name of Zagig the Great, I command the occupant
of the third cell to come forth!&quot;
