 Research time requires the character be in good health. Further, he must
refrain from adventuring while undertaking the study. During research, wizards study
over old manuscripts and priests work at their devotions.
<P></P>
 The minimum amount of time needed to research a spell is two weeks per spell
level. At the end of this time, a check is made. For wizards, this is the same
as their chance to learn a spell (be sure to account for any specialization).
For priests a Wisdom check is made.
<P></P>
 If this check succeeds, the character has researched the spell. If the check
fails, the character must spend another week in study before making another
check. This continues until the character either succeeds or gives up.
