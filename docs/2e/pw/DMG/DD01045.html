hostile creatures within a 40-foot radius must successfully save vs. spell or
become enraged. Those whose saving throws succeed may perform normally; enraged
enemies fly into a berserk fury and attack the nearest creature, even their own
comrades (+1 bonus to attack rolls, +2 bonus to damage, -3 to their own Armor
Class).
<P></P>
 The rage lasts for 1d6+6 rounds, and during this period, the enraged creatures
will attack continually, without reason or fear, moving on to attack other
creatures nearest them if initial opponents are slain. A scarab of this type
contains from 1d6+18 charges.
