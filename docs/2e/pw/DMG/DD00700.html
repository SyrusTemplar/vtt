 As a general rule, potion containers should bear no identifying marks, so
player characters must sample from each container to determine the nature of the
liquid inside. However, even a small taste should suffice to identify a potion in
some way. Introduce different sorts of potions, both helpful and harmful, to
cause difficulties in identification. In addition, the same type of potion, when
created in different labs, might smell, taste, and look differently.
