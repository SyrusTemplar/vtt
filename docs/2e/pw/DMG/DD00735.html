<TITLE>Oil of Fumbling-- Potion (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Oil of Fumbling:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This oil will seem to be of a useful type—<I>acid resistance, slipperiness,</I> etc.—until the wearer is under stress in an actual melee situation. At that
point, he has a 50% chance each round to fumble and drop whatever he
holds—weapon, shield, spell components, and so forth. Only a thorough bath of some solvent
(alcohol, etc.) will remove the oil before it wears off.
