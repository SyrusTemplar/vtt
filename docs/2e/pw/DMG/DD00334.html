 One control you have over the power of wizards is the choice of spells
available at the start of the game. Each wizard begins the game with a spell book, but
he has no information on what that book contains. You tell him. You can choose
from several different answers. Based on your choice, the player acquires
spells (and their reverse) for his character's spell book.
