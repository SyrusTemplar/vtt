 Dirty straw in leaky stables, muck-floored huts outside the walls of town,
contempt, and random violence--these typify squalid living conditions. Characters
living like this aren't likely to be robbed (since no one thinks they have any
money), but they may be tormented or attacked just for the fun of it. Their
legal protections will be few indeed.
