 Thus, in at least these three situations, player characters would do well to
secure the cooperation of local officials before they do anything. Such
cooperation is rarely forthcoming without some kind of conditions: A noble may require
a cash bond before he will agree to release those under him; guilds may demand
concessions to regulate their craft within the boundaries of the player
character's lands; dukes and kings may require treaties or even diplomatic marriages;
burghers could ask for protection or a free charter. Anything the DM can
imagine and negotiate with the player is a possibility.
