 Individual experience point awards are given for things a player does or
things he has his character do. Intelligent play is worth experience; good
role-playing is worth experience; actions that fit the group's style are worth
experience.
<P></P>
 Although some of these awards are tied to abilities, giving out these
experience points is purely a discretionary act. It is up to the DM to decide if a
player character has earned the award and, within a given range, to determine the
amount of the award. These awards are normally given at the end of each session,
but this isn't a hard-and-fast rule--the DM can award individual experience
points any time he feels it appropriate.
<P></P>
 Individual experience point awards are divided into two categories. First are
awards all player characters can earn, regardless of class. After these are the
awards characters can earn according to their character group and class. This
information is given on Tables 33 and 34.
