<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sword+3, Frost Brand, +6 vs. fire-using/dwelling creatures:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This sword always provides a +3 bonus. The +6 bonus takes effect against
creatures that use fire or live in fiery environments. The weapon does not shed any
light, except when the air temperature is below 0 degrees F. It does give
special benefits against fire, for its wielder is protected as if he were wearing a <I>ring of fire resistance.</I>
<P></P>
 The <I>frost brand</I> sword also has a 50% chance of extinguishing any fire into which its blade is
thrust. This power extends to a 10-foot radius—including a <I>wall of fire</I> but excluding a <I>fireball, meteor swarm,</I> or <I>flame strike.</I>
