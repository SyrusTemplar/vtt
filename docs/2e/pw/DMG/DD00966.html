will radiate magic if this is detected for. The wearer of a <I>helm of telepathy</I> is able to determine the thoughts of creatures within a 60-foot range. There
are two limitations on this power: The wearer must know the language used by
such creatures (the racial tongue will be used in thoughts in preference to the
Common, the Common in preference to alignment languages); and there can't be
more than 3 feet of solid stone, 3 inches of iron, or any solid sheeting of lead
or gold between the wearer and the creatures.

thoughts. The wearer may communicate by language with any creature within range
if there is a mutually known speech, or emotions may be transmitted (empathy)
so that a creature will receive the emotional message of the wearer.

Intelligence lower than the telepathist, but a +1 bonus for every point of
Intelligence higher than the wearer of the helm. If Intelligence is equal, no
adjustment is made when the saving throw is rolled.
