<TITLE>Oil of Slipperiness-- Potion (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Oil of Slipperiness:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Similar to the <I> oil of etherealness </I> described above, this liquid is to be applied externally. This application
makes it impossible for the individual to be grabbed, grasped, or hugged by any
opponent, or constricted by snakes or tentacles. (Note that a roper could still
inflict weakness, but that the monster's tentacles could not entwine the
opponent coated with <I> oil of slipperiness</I>.)
<P></P>
 In addition, such obstructions as webs, magical or otherwise, will not effect
an anointed individual. Bonds such an ropes, manacles, and chains can be
slipped free. Magical ropes and the like are not effective against this oil. If
poured on a floor or on steps, there is a 95% chance that creatures standing on the
surface will slip and fall. The oil requires eight hours to wear off normally,
or it can be wiped off with an alcohol solution (even wine!).
