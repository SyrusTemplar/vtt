</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Horn of Goodness/Evil:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This magical instrument adapts itself to the alignment of its possessor, so it
will produce either a good or an evil effect depending on the alignment of its
owner. If the possessor is absolutely neutral, the horn will have no power
whatsoever. If the owner is good, then blowing the horn has the effect of a <I>protection from evil</I> spell in a 10-foot radius, and this protection will last for 10 rounds. Each
friendly/allied creature within this area will be affected as if granted the
spell. If the horn is of evil alignment, then the reverse of the noted spell
occurs within the area of effect. The horn can be blown once per day.
