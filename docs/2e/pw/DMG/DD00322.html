 Some horses have a seemingly malicious tendency to step on feet as they are
being saddled and groomed--and then they refuse to move. Some refuse to gallop
unless forced. Some stubborn horses just stop in the middle of a march and almost
have to be dragged forward. Others take an almost human pleasure in rubbing
against fences, walls, and trees trying to scrape their rider off. Bucking
<P></P>
horses are always unpleasant, though at least the rider can usually feel the
horse tense up just before it happens.
<P></P>
 Untrained horses, even those broken for riding, haven't learned the basic
commands of horsemanship--left, right, speed up, or slow down. They do what they
think they are supposed to, but that isn't always right.
<P></P>
 Some, while trained, are just plain headstrong and, figuring they know more
than their riders, try to do what they want. Single-rider horses have been
trained too well, recognizing only a single master. With time they can be ridden by a
new owner, but they will not respond well to others, even friends of the
owner. On rare occasions a horse may actually know a minor trick, usually learned
without special training. These tricks are very simple--to come when whistled
for, to rear on a tug of the reins, or to turn when the rider presses with his
knees.
<P></P>
 Particularly lively horses have their own special quirks. Some just cannot
seem to move at a slow steady pace. Every step is a jolting, bouncing bone-jarring
ride. Others are born leapers, making corrals and fences only an occasional
barrier. An ill-tempered few will rear suddenly at the most surprising moments,
especially in the midst of combat. When the horse does this, it is not attacking
so much as reacting in fear and surprise. Many a rider has been dumped by this
sudden move.
