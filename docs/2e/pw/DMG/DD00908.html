<TITLE>Candle of Invocation-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Candle of Invocation:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">These specially blessed tapers are dedicated to the pantheon of gods of one of
the nine alignments. The typical candle is not remarkable, but if a <I>detection</I> spell is cast, it will radiate magic. It also radiates good or evil, if
appropriate.
<P></P>
 Simply burning the candle generates a favorable aura for the individual so
doing—if the candle's alignment matches that of the character's. If burned by a
priest of the same alignment, the candle temporarily increases the priest's level
of experience by 2, enabling him to cast additional spells. He can even cast
spells normally unavailable to him, as if he were of the higher level, but only
so long as the candle continues to burn. Any burning allows the casting of a <I>gate</I> spell, the respondent being of the alignment of the candle, but the taper is
immediately consumed in the process.
<P></P>
 Otherwise, each candle burns for four hours. It is possible to extinguish the
candle as placed in a lantern or otherwise sheltered to protect it from drafts
and other things which could put it out. This doesn't affect its magical
properties.
