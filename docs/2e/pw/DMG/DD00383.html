The AD&amp;D game is an adventure game designed to give players a feeling of
excitement and danger. Characters brave the unknown perils of moldering dungeons and
thorn-covered wilderness, facing hideous monsters and evil villains. Thus, it
is important for all players to know the basic rules for handling combat.
<P></P>
 To create the proper sense of danger and excitement, the rules for combat must
be thorough, but they also must be playable and exciting enough to create a
vivid picture in the minds of the players. Combat in the AD&amp;D game has to allow
many different actions and outcomes--as many as the imagination can produce.
Knowing that anything could happen next, because the rules allow it, creates
excitement for everyone.
