<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Growth:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This potion causes the height and weight of the person consuming it to
increase. Garments and other worn and carried gear also grow in size. Each fourth of
the liquid consumed causes 6 feet of height growth—in other words, a full potion
increases height by 24 feet. Weight increases should be proportional to the
change in height. Strength is increased sufficiently to allow bearing armor and
weapons commensurate with the increased size, but does not provide combat
bonuses. Movement increases to that of a giant of approximately equal size.
