<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Incense of Obsession:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">These strange blocks of incense exactly resemble <I>incense of meditation.</I> If meditation and prayer are conducted while the lit <I>incense of obsession</I> is nearby, its odor and smoke will cause the priest to become totally
confident that his spell ability is superior, due to the magical incense. The priest
will be determined to use his spells at every opportunity, even when not needed
or when useless. The priest will remain obsessed with his abilities and spells
until all are cast or 24 hours have elapsed.
<P></P>
 There are 2d4 pieces of this incense normally, each burning for one hour.
