<TITLE>Gloves of Missile Snaring-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Gloves of Missile Snaring:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">These gloves radiate slightly of enchantment and alteration if magic is
detected for. Once snugly worn, they seem to meld with the hands, becoming almost
invisible (undetectable unless within five feet of the wearer). Either or both
hands so clad, if not already holding something, can be used to pick many sorts of
missiles out of the air, thus preventing possible harm, and enabling the
wearer to return a hand-thrown missile to its sender as an attack in a subsequent
round.
<P></P>
 All forms of small, hand-hurled or weapon-propelled missiles (arrows, bolts,
darts, bullets, javelins, axes, hammers, spears, and the like) can be caught. If
the weapon magically returns to the attacker, then catching it simply prevents
damage, and returning the weapon does not result in an attack.
