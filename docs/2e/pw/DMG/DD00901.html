<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Bracers of Defenselessness:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">These appear to be <I>bracers of defense,</I> and will actually serve as such until the wearer is attacked in anger by a
dangerous enemy. At that moment, the bracers worsen Armor Class to 10 and negate
any and all other magical protections and Dexterity bonuses. <I>Bracers of defenselessness</I> can be removed only by means of a <I>remove curse</I> spell.
