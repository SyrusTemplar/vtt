<TITLE>Sheet of Smallness-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Sheet of Smallness:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A magical item of this sort appears to be nothing more than a well-made piece
of material—possibly some sort of covering or sheet woven of very fine linen or
silk. One side will have a larger pattern than the other, or perhaps one side
will be white, the other black. In any event, there will be an aura of
alteration detectable from this cloth if magic is checked for.
<P></P>
 This item causes any magical item wrapped within it to shrink to 1/12 its
normal size and weight. If the item is then wrapped in the sheet so as to be
touching the reverse side of the material, it will grow back to its normal size and
weight. Note that this item has no effect on artifacts, relics, or living
material—it affects only non-living, ordinary magical items—and no item shrunk in
this fashion is functional or usable while in reduced form. Change in size
requires two rounds to accomplish, either in shrinking or restoring to normal size.
