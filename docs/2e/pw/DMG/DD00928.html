<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Decanter of Endless Water:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This stoppered flask looks ordinary but radiates the aura of magic. If the
stopper is removed, and the proper words spoken, a stream of fresh or salt water
pours out, as ordered. There are separate command words for the amount as well
as the type of water. Water can be made to come forth as follows:
<P></P>
 <I>Stream:</I> pours out 1 gallon per round
<P></P>
 <I>Fountain:</I> 5-foot long stream at 5 gallons per round
<P></P>
 <I>Geyser:</I> 20-foot long stream at 30 gallons per round
<P></P>
 The geyser causes considerable back pressure, and the holder must be well
braced or be knocked over. The force of the geyser will kill small animals and
insects (mice, moles, small bats, etc.). The command word must be given to cease.
<P></P>
