 All of the above notwithstanding, you don't want to force a player to accept a
character he doesn't really like. All you will do is lose a player. If someone
really is dissatisfied, either make some adjustments to the character or let
him roll up a new one.
<P></P>
 When adjusting ability scores, follow these guidelines:
<P></P>
<B>•</B> Don't adjust an ability score above the minimum required to qualify for a
particular class or race. You are being kind enough already without giving away 10
percent experience bonuses.
<P></P>
<B>•</B> Don't adjust an ability score above 15. Only two classes have ability
minimums higher than 15: paladins and illusionists. Only very special characters can
become paladins and illusionists. If you give these classes away, they lose
their charm.
<P></P>
<B>•</B> Don't adjust an ability score that isn't required for the race or class the
player wants his character to be.
<P></P>
<B>•</B> Think twice before raising an ability score to let a character into an
optional class if he already qualifies for the standard class in that group. For
example, if Kirizov has the scores he needs to be a half-elf fighter, does he
really need to be a half-elf ranger? Encourage the player to develop a character who
always wanted to be a ranger but just never got the chance, or who fancies
himself a ranger but is allergic to trees. Encourage role-playing!
