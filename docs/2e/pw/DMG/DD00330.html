 When weapons are subjected to a general danger--the flames of a fireball, the
icy chill of a cold ray, or the smashing blow of a giant's boulder--the roll to
hit and hit points do not apply. Instead, the following <A HREF="DD00331.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00331.html">Item Saving Throw table</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> is used. This saving throw represents an item's general ability to withstand
the effects of the attack. It is rolled just like a normal saving throw (see &quot;<A HREF="DD00510.html#3810c359"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00510.html#3810c359">Combat</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">&quot;).
<P></P>
 The item saving throw should be used only when the item is not being carried
by a character or when a character fails his saving throw against the same
attack. A character who successfully saves against the blast of a<I> fireball</I> spell need not make separate saving throws for his potions. The character who
failed the same save failed to protect himself adequately and must therefore
check for his potions (and probably his scrolls, too). Not all items need make a
save in every instance. It is perfectly reasonable to ignore the save for a
character's sword and armor in the same fireball situation described above, since
there is so little chance that these will be affected.
<P></P>
 Furthermore, magical items are more resistant to damage, gaining bonuses to
the saving throw. Items with a plus (a <I>sword +1</I>, for example) gain that plus as a bonus to the die roll. If the item
possesses additional special abilities, it should have an extra plus for each of these.
Magical items with no stated pluses should gain a bonus relative to their
power. A potion would have a +1 while a miscellaneous magical item could have a +5
or +6. Further, if the saving throw is versus an attack the device was designed
to counter (e.g., extreme cold vs. a<I> ring of warmth</I>), an additional bonus of +2 is allowed.
