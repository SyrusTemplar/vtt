<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Mirror Of Opposition:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This item exactly resembles a normal mirror. If a creature is reflected in its
surface, an exact duplicate of the creature will come into being, and this
opposite will immediately attack the creature reflected. Note that the duplicate
will have all items and powers of the original (including magic), but upon the
defeat or destruction of either, the duplicate and his item disappear completely.
