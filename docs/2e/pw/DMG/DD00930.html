<TITLE>Deck of Many Things-- Magical Item (Dungeon Master Guide)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Deck of Many Things:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A <I>deck of many things</I> (beneficial and baneful) is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each
deck contains a number of cards, or plaques, made of ivory or vellum. Each is
engraved with glyphs, characters, and magical sigils. As soon as one of these cards
is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for
better or worse.
<P></P>
 The character with a <I>deck of many things</I> can announce that he is drawing only one card, or he can draw two, three,
four, or more. However, the number must be announced prior to drawing the first
card. If a jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw two
additional cards.
<P></P>
 Each time a card is taken from the deck it is replaced (making it possible to
draw the same card twice) unless the draw is a jester or fool, in which case
the card is discarded from the pack. A <I>deck of many things</I> contains either 13 cards (75% chance) or 22 cards (25%). Additional cards in
a 22-card deck are indicated below by an asterisk (*) before their names. To
simulate the magical cards you may want to use the normal playing card in the
suits indicated in the second column. (The notation is face value, then suit).

<P></P>

<P></P>
 Upon drawing the last card possible, or immediately upon drawing the cards in
bold face (The Void and Donjon), the deck disappears. The cards are explained
in greater detail below:
<P></P>
 <I>Sun:</I> Roll for a miscellaneous magical item (<A HREF="DD00674.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00674.html">Table 88</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> ) until a useful item is indicated.
<P></P>
 <I>Moon:</I> This is best represented by a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of
wishes shown as gleams therein. These wishes are the same as the 9th-level wizard
spell and must be used in a number of turns equal to the number received.
<P></P>
 <I>Star:</I> If the two points would place the character's score at 19, use one or both in
any of the other abilities in this order: Constitution, Charisma, Wisdom,
Dexterity, Intelligence, Strength.
<P></P>
 <I>Comet:</I> The player must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster(s)
encountered or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character moves to the mid-point
of the next experience level.
<P></P>
 <I>Throne:</I> If Charisma is 18 already, the individual still gains five on encounter and
loyalty reactions. He becomes a real leader in people's eyes. The castle gained
will be near a stronghold already possessed (if any).
<P></P>
 <I>Key:</I> DM must prepare a treasure map. The weapon must be one usable by the
character, so use the Magical Weapons Table until a useful item is awarded.
<P></P>
 <I>Knight:</I> The fighter will join as the character's henchman and loyally serve until
death. He has +1 per die (18 maximum) on each ability roll.
<P></P>
 <I>Gem:</I> This indicates wealth. The jewelry will all be gold set with gems, the gems
all of 1,000 gp base value. With this wealth should come experience points equal
in value, but never more than needed to increase one level of experience.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>The Void: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This black card spells instant disaster. The character's body continues to
function, though he or she speaks like an automaton, but the psyche is trapped in
a prison somewhere—in an object on a far planet or plane, possibly in the
possession of an outer planar creature. A <I>wish</I> will not bring the character back, but the plane of entrapment might be
revealed. Draw no more cards.
<P></P>
 <I>Flames:</I> Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational
forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outer planar creature can't be ended until
one of the parties has been slain.
<P></P>
 <I>Skull:</I> A minor Death appears (AC -4; 33 hit points; strikes with a scythe for 2d8
points, never missing, always striking first in a round). The character must
fight it alone—if others help, they get minor Deaths to fight as well. If the
character is slain, he is slain forever. Treat the Death as undead with respect to
spells. Cold, fire, and electrical energy do not harm it.
<P></P>
 <I>Talons:</I> When this card is drawn, every magical item owned or possessed by the
character is instantly and irrevocably gone.
<P></P>
 <I>Ruin:</I> As implied, when this card is drawn every bit of money (including all gems,
jewelry, treasure, and art objects) is lost. All land and buildings currently
owned are lost forever as well.
<P></P>
 <I>Euryale:</I> The medusalike visage of this card brings a curse only the Fates card or
godlike beings can remove. The -3 penalty to all saving throws is otherwise
permanent.
<P></P>
 <I>Rogue:</I> When this card is drawn, one of the character's henchmen will be totally
alienated and forever-after hostile. If the character has no henchmen, the enmity
of some powerful personage—community or religious—can be substituted. The  hatred will be secret until the time is ripe for devastating effect.
<P></P>
 <I>Balance:</I> As in &quot;weighed in the balance and found wanting,&quot; the character must change
to a radically different alignment. Failure to act according to the new
alignment may bring penalties (as described in Chapter 4, &quot;<A HREF="DD00285.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00285.html">Effects of Changing Alignment</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> &quot;). Discard the cards.
<P></P>
 <I>Jester:</I> This card actually makes a pack more beneficial if the experience point award
is taken. It is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Fool.
<P></P>
 <I>Fool:</I> The payment and draw are mandatory!
<P></P>
 <I>Vizier:</I> This card empowers the character drawing it with the ability to call upon
supernatural wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question
whenever he so requests. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted
upon is another question entirely.
<P></P>
 <I>Idiot:</I> This card causes the loss of 1d4 points of Intelligence immediately. The
additional draw is optional.
<P></P>
 <I>Fates:</I> This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if
so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it
does not enable something to happen—it can only stop something from happening. The
reversal is only for the character who drew the card, and other party members
may have to endure the confrontation.
<P></P>
 </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Donjon: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This signifies imprisonment—either by spell or by some creature/being, at the
DM's option. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case.
Whether these items are recoverable is, likewise, up to the DM. Draw no more cards.
<P></P>
