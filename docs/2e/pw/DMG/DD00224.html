 Demihuman characters with extremely high ability scores in their prime
requisites can exceed the racial maximum levels. In cases where multiple prime
requisites exist, the lowest prime requisite is used to calculate any additional
levels.
<P></P>
 The bonus levels available to characters with high prime requisite scores are
summarized on <A HREF="DD00225.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD00225.html">Table 8</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> . The additional levels listed in Table 8 are added to the normal maximum
allowed, regardless of what class or race is involved.
<P></P>
 For example, a half-elf is limited to 12th level as a thief. A half-elf thief
with a Dexterity score of 17, however, is allowed two bonus levels, so he could
advance to 14th level.
