 Casting times for spells can modify initiative rolls, creating a realistic
delay for the spellcaster. When a spell's &quot;casting time&quot; parameter is given as a
number without any units (e.g., rounds or turns), then that number is added to
the caster's initiative roll to determine his modified initiative. When a spell
requires a round or more to cast, a normal initiative roll is not made--a spell
requiring one round to cast takes effect at the end of the current round,
after all other actions are completed.
<P></P>
 Spells that require more than one round to cast involve some bookkeeping. The
DM or one of the players must keep track of the rounds spent in casting. If the
spellcasting character is disturbed during this time, the spell is lost. If
all goes well, the spell takes effect at the very end of the last round of the
required casting time. Thus, a spell requiring 10 minutes to cast would require
10 combat rounds, and wouldn't take effect until the very end of the 10th round.
