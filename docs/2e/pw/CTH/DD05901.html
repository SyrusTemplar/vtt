  This section covers the design of a thieves' guild. As you flesh out the
details of your own guild, you'll want to record them on paper for reference during
play. Following the details of the system, a worked-out example is given to
show how to build up a well-detailed, atmospheric guild from the bare bones of the
tables.
<P></P>
    This section is also not just for the DM. Players can be asked by a DM to do
some work for him! A player can roll up a guild for the DM to use in some other
setting, or some distant city (which the PCs will visit some time later after
the DM has tweaked the players' dice rolls a little!). Also, a DM can allow a
player to roll up details of a guild which the PC is about to take over as
guildmaster, if he trusts the player enough! There is also a special section on PC
guildmasters later on.
