  A well-defined cultural store of valuable objects always gives a thief
something to think about, and can provide some wonderful impetus for roleplaying. (&quot;I
simply must have that last Van Hoot original!&quot;) These items add a great deal of
color and life to a campaign, encouraging players and the DM alike to think in
terms other than simply the gp value of a treasure. Indeed, a valuable art
object may be worth far more than its base value to a collector. By the same
token, such an object might be recognized far and wide as stolen property—a
complication that can make disposal of the goods an adventure in its own right.
<P></P>
    Part of this campaign aspect involves establishing a consistent economic
system for the world, of course, as mentioned above. But taking the time to specify
treasures and their worth within that economic system carries the concept to a
level of detail that greatly enhances any campaign—but particularly one
involving many thieves and their illicit activities.
<P></P>
    Objects can be classified by type and artist, most obviously, but also by such
things as materials (especially in the area of gems and jewelry), intricacy of
design, and size.
<P></P>
    It doesn't so much matter <I>what</I> you choose to invent and define here. It is more important for the DM to
create enough detail about some area that the most treasured pieces are known to
one and all, and enough other facts about the art to allow PC thieves to make
proper value judgements.
<P></P>
    Of course, establishing an artistic level of a culture is an ingredient of any
campaign. Thieves, however, are more apt to become involved in the gaining and
losing of such items than are characters of other classes, and because of this
the thief campaign calls for a little extra attention to be paid here.
<P></P>
    Whether these objects are paintings, statues, jewelry or gemwork, tapestries
or rugs, ornate crystal, or religious icons, a well-defined set of existing
treasures helps a thief put his own acquisitions and losses into context. Dungeon
Masters will find the time spent creating a detailed cultural and artistic
background for the campaign well spent.
<P></P>
    Player character thieves will doubtless find one or two more things that just
might cause them to lick their chops.
