  A thief may attempt to force a lock open with a lock chisel and a small
hammer. This is not really a highly skilled activity, and the DM might consider
extending this to non-thieves. The base chance for success is equal to the open
doors percentage (which is Strength-based, of course). A thief may add one-fifth of
his open locks chance to this base chance—knowing something about locks does
give a slight advantage here. Obviously, forcing a lock is a noisy activity and
any hope of subtlety and surprise evaporates with the first blow.
