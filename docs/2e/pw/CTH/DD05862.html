  The alignment of the rulers of society will have a dominating effect on this
relationship. However, there will be other factors of importance, too. Here is a
simple example: A lawful good state is at war with a powerful, evil neighbor.
Almost all of the country's resources will go into the war effort—and
able-bodied men and women who might otherwise be law enforcers putting down thieves will
be fighting in battles instead. Thus, thieves will find life much easier than
usual in such a land. From the patterns below, some will obviously tend to
align with certain alignments, and this will be reflected in the guild design
process later. But nothing is ever cut and dried, and 100% predictable!
