  The equipment detailed here offers sneaky combat options for thieves, which
any character with any real decency and sense of honor would usually eschew.
Since by definition some of these items subvert normal combat options, the DM
should feel free to modify and/or restrict the availability of items he feels
unsuited to his campaign.  the concealed weapons listed, at the least, should
definitely be made available to thieves who are members of Assassins' Guilds.
