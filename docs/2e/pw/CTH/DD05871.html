  Somewhat like the state of affairs described above, but the merchants don't go
to such lengths to protect themselves or keep thieves off their backs. They
don't like thieves, they don't accept them as a part of society or a tolerable
evil, but they don't go overboard about them either. Such merchants are fairly
stoutly resistant to any attempt at coercion or blackmail, and they use their
influence with the powers-that-be to keep life tough for thieves.
