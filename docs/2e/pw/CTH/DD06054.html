  Perhaps the player character thieves will be content at the start of a
campaign to plunder this noble mansion and that opulent gallery, staying one or two
steps ahead of the city watch. Such campaigns require little planning beyond the
next gaming session for the DM, and work well with players who can only attend
occasional gaming sessions.
<P></P>
    However, the repetition of objectives and motivations can prevent players from
exploring the full possibilities of their characters and the game. Even if
each mission involves a different setting, new monsters, and unique, challenging
traps and NPCs, players and DMs alike may find themselves wanting more.
<P></P>
    The addition of a basic storyline can add a theme tying the campaign together,
giving the player characters a cause higher than mere plunder for their
exploits. Storylines allow for greater development of NPCs, and also provide the PCs
with more opportunities for interactive roleplaying (as opposed to combat and
other physical encounters).
<P></P>
    Several suggested storylines are presented here. Many dungeon masters prefer
to create their own, and this is encouraged. The examples are brief enough that
each campaign's will be specifically tailored for a unique fit.
