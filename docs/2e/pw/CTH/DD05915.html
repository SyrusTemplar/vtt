  The guild may well have very close affiliations with a small number of
NPCs—especially tough fighters—who may be honorary &quot;guildmembers.&quot;  These men may
guard the guildhouse, go on planned jobs as look-outs and muscle, provide the
muscle to enforce protection rackets, act as bodyguards, and the like. However, they
will not usually be full members of the guild. The DM should design such NPCs
as the need arises.
