<P></P>
<I>  Description:</I> The Fence is a black marketeer, a seller of stolen or otherwise illegal
goods. He is almost always found in a city setting, where there are large numbers of
people to serve as customers as well as prey for the thieves who supply him.
<P></P>
    A good Fence needs a sharp mind to appraise people as well as goods, and to
stay ahead of the law. To take this kit, therefore, a thief needs a minimum
Intelligence of 12.
<P></P>
    <I>Role:</I> The Fence is the linchpin in the complicated web of the black market. Thieves
sell their illicit acquisitions to the Fence, for some amount of money below
their actual value. The Fence then resells the &quot;hot&quot; goods on the black market.
If the city in which he operates is large and the goods are minor enough (not
the crown jewels of the local royalty), they may be sold directly to local
buyers. If the Fence thinks they're &quot;too hot,&quot; though, he will probably arrange to
have them smuggled and sold elsewhere.
<P></P>
    Power for Fences is rarely measured in terms of character level. Instead, it
is a matter of the breadth of the Fence's network and the reliability of his
contacts. Of course, to acquire or retain an extensive network, a Fence needs much
cunning and experience—which may coincidentally result in a high character
level.
<P></P>
    The most powerful Fences keep their identities secret, and may never see their
clients, neither thieves nor buyers. They coordinate things from behind the
scenes, and have minor Fences to serve as intermediaries. Even a close contact
may never have seen the face of a great Fence—at least, not knowingly. A Fence
may secretly play the role of an underling in his own network—or even that of a
rival or freelancer!
<P></P>
    This may all start to sound familiar to those who know something about
thieves' guilds. The networks of a powerful Fence look increasingly like the structure
of a thieves' guild. This is no coincidence. Those who are knowledgeable in
these matters speculate that the thieves' guild was originally, and in many
respects still is, a black market network made into a formal entity.
<P></P>
    Fences may be of any social background, though wealthy and noble Fences are
rare. Certainly those that do exist diligently keep their identities well-hidden,
for obvious reasons. The stakes must be high to claim the attention of the
socially and financially elevated.
<P></P>
    For example, a rich merchant may deal with stolen jewelry on the side. Or a
baron may be the secret mastermind behind a network of thieves smuggling and
selling contraband. The real world offers other examples—such as petty dictators
who do not only accept bribes and turn a blind eye to drug smugglers but are in
fact a drug lord themselves!
<P></P>
    The black market network transfers information as well as goods. Fences are
probably the best-informed figures of the underworld. For this reason they gain
&quot;gather intelligence&quot; as a bonus nonweapon proficiency. (They also receive
&quot;appraising&quot; as a bonus proficiency, since it is vital to their vocation.)
<P></P>
    <I>Secondary Skills:</I> Gambler, Jeweler, Scribe, Teamster/Freighter, Trader/Barterer.
<P></P>
    <I>Weapon Proficiencies:</I> Any.
<P></P>
    <I>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</I> Required: Appraising, Gather Intelligence. Recommended: Alertness,
Fast-talking, Forgery, Gem Cutting, Local History, Observation.
<P></P>
    <I>Skill Progression:</I> Less powerful Fences (that is, those lower in the network hierarchy, with
fewer contacts) may need to make use of thiefly skills. Picking pockets may
provide a little income when business is slow; its use for sleight-of-hand may also
have value (though it is dangerous to cheat clients). Opening locks and finding
and removing traps are useful skills for inspecting merchandise. It is not
unknown for Burglars, unable to open a strongbox, to simply cart off the whole
thing and hope their Fence can get it open. Read languages is also sometimes useful
in examining merchandise. The stealth skills (move silently, etc.) have some
value on the street; Fences who have direct contact with their clients may put
some time into cultivating them, but more powerful Fences often neglect them.
<P></P>
    <I>Equipment: </I>Most Fences own equipment for examining merchandise, to determine if the goods
are counterfeit or what their  value might be. A magnifying lens, for
instance, may be of use here.
<P></P>
  <I>  Special Benefits:</I> Because of his contacts, a Fence is probably the best person for locating and
hiring thieves and smugglers, especially in territory not claimed by a guild.
<P></P>
    Also, Fences generally command a lot of respect from the underworld in their
home territory. Unless a thief has a serious vendetta, he will probably court a
Fence's favor for business reasons. Fences receive a bonus of +3 on reactions
with NPC thieves if their profession is recognized.
<P></P>
    <I>Special Hindrances:</I> Fences are relatively prominent in the underworld. And, unlike freelance
burglars and smugglers who can move from place to place, the Fences' black market
network requires a stable home locale, so that they can stay in touch with their
contacts. (The DM may wish to keep PCs from being active Fences because of
this; the Fence's life is much more business than adventure.) This also means that
the local authorities may be aware of a Fence's identity and activities. These
authorities may periodically harass a minor Fence, or demand bribes, or may
shake him up for information every once in a while.
<P></P>
  <I>  Races:</I> Fences may be of any race. Some demihuman Fences prefer to deal only in
certain goods. Dwarf and gnome Fences, for instance, are known as shrewd appraisers
of stolen gems and jewelry.
