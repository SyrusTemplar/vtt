  It's really no problem to record your Thief Kit on your character record
sheet. Where you normally write down the character's class, add also his Thief Kit
name. For instance, if your thief takes the cutpurse kit, you would write
&quot;Thief/Cutpurse.&quot;
<P></P>
    Where you normally write his nonweapon proficiencies, add the ones (if any)
you got free from the Thief Kit, and designate them with asterisks to indicate
their bonus status. Wherever you have space for notes, mark down the character's
special benefits, hindrances, and other facts you want to remember.
