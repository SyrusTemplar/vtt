  Possibly the strongest antipathy between the races in many AD&amp;D® campaigns is
between elves and dwarves. This can strongly affect guild structures. In the
worst case, a city might have an elven guild and a dwarven guild, both vying for
humans to join their side, and with other races tending to ally one way or the
other (gnomes might join dwarves, and halflings side with elves, for example).
The antipathy of the two might override even alignment factors. This could
break out into open warfare between the factions, or a long-running guerilla war
could be the result.
