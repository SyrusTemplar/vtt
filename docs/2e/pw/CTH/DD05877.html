  These are the myriad guilds of gemcutters, barbers and dentists, butchers and
bakers, and so on. Thieves will not have dealings of note with many of them,
but there are one or two exceptions. Pawnbrokers are an obvious possible &quot;front&quot;
for thieves and fences, likewise moneylenders (with their safes and secure
chests and the like). Thieves may thus cooperate with many such, and minimize
robberies of the rest! Guilds which take young apprentices may be paid small sums
for handing over to the thieves youngsters who seem to be highly dexterous and
capable of developing into thieves, given suitable training. In special instances
(e.g., thieves allied with seafaring smugglers), other alliances (e.g., with
the seamen's guild) may be of note.
<P></P>
    If there are unusual thief-craftsmen alliances (or oppositions), the DM should
script them individually; they will need individual rationales, which should
be explained and noted!
