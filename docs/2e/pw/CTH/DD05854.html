  A first simple point is that a thieves' guild has to have enough work to
support it! A small hamlet of 50 or so peasant farmers, most of whom are desperately
poor, wouldn't support a single cutpurse, let alone a thieves' guild. A busy
working town along a trade route, though, might well attract several thieves,
even if the actual population was fairly low. If the village relied on monies
passing through the place (coaching inns, hospitality, markets, etc.), it would be
much richer in terms of money available for the thieves to filch than a place
with the same population but dependent on the turnip harvest! In the design
process, some specific rules for determining how many thieves various communities
can support are given.
