  First, we need to establish the background of the guild. Such details of the
guild as size, rulership, and the like will be affected by social factors,
alignment, and so on. Therefore, this background is developed first. In this way,
later dice rolls for aspects of the guild can be given modifiers for previously
established background.
<P></P>
    Many of the tables to follow will refer to background elements already
detailed in the previous section, so the DM will know what brief entries mean. This
obviously aids the process of DM selection, if dice-rolling is not being used.
