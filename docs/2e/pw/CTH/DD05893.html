  Rather unusually, the rulers of the guild are elected by the guild members.
This does not mean that these rulers need be weaklings, or afraid of using their
powers sternly and firmly when they need to (imagine a ruler elected for a
10-year term for example!). The &quot;elections&quot; may be the source of notable
corruption, bribery, fixing, and vote-rigging of all sorts. The devious DM can imagine
dozens of ways of embroiling PCs in the kind of scandals and scams such a state
of affairs will throw up!
