  Thieves who can also perform the tasks of one or more other character classes
also offer clear advantages when accompanying a mission. The fighter/thief, for
example, will find many opportunities to wield his sword and perhaps a shield
while his stealthy comrades go about their work.
<P></P>
    However, thief characters who also exhibit knowledge of another character
class will sometimes undergo the scorn and mistrust of their more &quot;pure&quot; comrades.
Very rarely will a thief/wizard or thief/cleric rise to a position of
prominence in a thieves guild. Fighter/thieves are subject to less prejudice, perhaps
because their abilities are clearly understandable to thieves. Fighter/thieves
are nonetheless considered by most thieves to be of somewhat lower status than
themselves.
