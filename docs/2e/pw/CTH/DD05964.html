  As the <I>Player's Handbook</I> explains, this ability is not literally just the knack of hiding in areas of
shadow while not moving. It also covers hiding in bushes, shrubs, behind
drapes, in alcoves—anywhere where there is a chance of skulking about immobile in
some location which offers cover and the hope of staying unseen. Considering
appropriate equipment needs to be considered in this light.
