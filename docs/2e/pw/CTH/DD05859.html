  Not all societies with the same dominant alignment need have the same attitude
toward thieves. One Lawful Good society might be dominated by priests of a god
stressing mercy, forgiveness, and humility; another might be dominated by
priests of a stern warrior god stressing protection, strength, and the need for
justice to prevail in all circumstances. Their attitudes to thieves would be
significantly different, to say the least!
