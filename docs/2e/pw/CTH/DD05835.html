  &quot;What do I get out of it?&quot; is a reasonable enough query from a player with a
PC thief when told his character must join a guild, or if it is strongly
suggested as a wise option by the DM. By answering the question, many of the functions
of the thieves' guild which benefit its members become clear. Below are
detailed the most common benefits gained, although these will vary from guild to
guild, with an example of one additional benefit typical only of membership in a
certain kind of guild—a highly organized and resourceful one!

    It is not the case that every guild will provide all the benefits listed
below, but certainly almost all guilds will provide training, access to necessary
equipment, and the like.
