  These are referred to in the multipliers following Table 23, above. They refer
to the following instructions given by the guildmaster:
<P></P>
    <I>Easygoing:</I> Guildmembers take life very easy. No morale modifiers.
<P></P>
    <I>Routine:</I> Guildmembers take life fairly easy, but keep their hands in. A +1 modifier
applies to morale for the first month (after this some of them get bored and
touchy).
<P></P>
    <I>Average:</I> The standard level of operations, no effects on morale.
<P></P>
  <I>  Pushy:</I> The guildmembers are pushed into doing some extra jobs here and there, and
grand, ambitious activities are eagerly pursued. This gives +1 to morale for the
first month (excitement), but -1 per month after the first if sustained,
cumulative to a maximum of -4).
<P></P>
    <I>Aggressive:</I> Guildmembers are told by the guildmaster to steal anything which isn't bolted
to the floor. This has an immediate effect on morale of -2, to which -1 is
added per month (cumulative) to a maximum of -10; at this point, a revolt is
automatically triggered.
<P></P>
    The more active the guild is, the more likely thieves are to be apprehended by
the law, however!
<P></P>
    The sums of money gained by the guildmaster this way will not be great, unless
the guild is a large one, the community is rich, and/or the guildmaster uses
aggressive thieving tactics. This is likely to be ale money for
guildmaster-level thieves, so other activities must be used to generate income. These will need
planning by the player in consultation with the DM. Reference should be made
to the <I>Player's Handbook</I> when considering the money side—how much shopkeepers can afford to pay as
protection money, for example. These sums are usually lower than most players
think! Making sure the target one strikes at is rich is a shrewd step in any
thiefly activity.
