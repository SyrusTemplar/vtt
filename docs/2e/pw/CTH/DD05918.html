  All thieves will have Dexterity of at least 9. You can roll NPC thief
Dexterity on 8+1d10, adding +1 for characters of 4th or higher level and +2 for
characters of 8th or higher level. Elves and halflings gain +1 to Dexterity scores. It
is strongly recommended that no scores above 18 be allowed, and certainly
absurd scores like 20+ should be reduced to 18. Other ability scores are discussed
below. Dexterity scores should be recorded for all thieves, since it affects AC
and their skills.
