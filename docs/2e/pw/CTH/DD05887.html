  The guild has been burst asunder by tensions within it, and there may well be
several competing guilds in the same town or city. This can happen because the
guildmaster is weak, because of ambitious young Turks seceding from the guild,
or for special reasons of many sorts (e.g., racial enmity between a guild of
dwarven thieves, and one of elven and half-elven thieves, in the same town).
<P></P>
    Relations between the different sub-guilds can vary considerably. If there is
still the shell of a central guild, then the different guilds may be on fair
terms still. However, at another extreme, the tensions and oppositions can
degenerate into street warfare and gang assaults.
<P></P>
    If there are, in effect, several guilds, then the DM will have to determine
the organization and leadership of each one separately.
