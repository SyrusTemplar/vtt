  This small lamp is oil-burning, with a reservoir of oil and a small wick sunk
into an earthenware shell. It is used by the thief to warm his hands, by
cupping them around it, if cold would otherwise impair his talents (try picking a
lock with frozen fingers in a cold clime!). Virtually no light is produced, the
aim simply being to warm the hands. The simplest version of this is a corked
earthenware sphere which can be filled with hot oil before the thief sets off on
his work, to be drawn from a pocket and held in the hands when needed.
