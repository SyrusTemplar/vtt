  By combining assorted settings, social backgrounds and motivations, you can
create a worldful of distinct thieves. Another way of making a character is to
start with a whole concept of what sort of thief he is, rather than building him
from the individual blocks we described above.
<P></P>
    But where do you get such a concept? History, folklore and literature all
provide colorful examples of thieves. From these you can abstract a model, an
archetype, on which you base your beginning character. Like the elements we
described above, these archetypes are rough and general. Through effective role-playing
you will expand your thief into a more detailed, interesting, and believable
character.
<P></P>
    Below are a number of sample archetypes that you may have encountered in
books, movies, and so forth. Experienced role-players will probably find that
thieves they've played in the past are similar to one of these archetypes, or are a
fusion of two or more.
<P></P>
    Remember that these archetypes, like the background options presented above,
are meant to inspire role-playing, not to limit it. The personality you create
should provide the basis of your character, but it would be wrong to define
every possible choice beforehand. Part of the pleasure of role-playing is seeing
your characters change and grow; like real people, they should be full of
surprises, ready to adapt and change with new situations.
<P></P>
  <B>  The Artist:</B> This thief is searching for &quot;the perfect crime.&quot; He chooses jobs for their
challenge and aesthetic pleasure, not strictly for their payoff in wealth.
<P></P>
    A drunken duke who is stumbling down an alley late at night, heavily laden
with jewels and gold, would be of little interest as a target for the Artist. In
fact, the Artist would be offended if someone were to suggest that he perform
such a ludicrously easy theft, since it would be so far &quot;below&quot; the Artist's
caliber.
<P></P>
    However, the Artist might take advantage of the situation if it might play
into a bigger, grander scheme. For instance, he might play the part of a &quot;Good
Samaritan,&quot; escorting the foolish noble to his residence, and thereby gaining the
duke's confidence. This gives the Artist special privileges, not the least of
which is the duke's unquestioning trust. (After all, how could the Artist have
been a thief if he escorted the duke safely home, rather than mugging him?) From
this position, then, the Artist may plan a truly exceptional theft, the sort
that would stir up an extraordinary amount of public interest, but could go
unsolved for decades.
<P></P>
    The Artist is usually found in an urban setting or, less frequently,
wandering. His family was surely above the poverty level, and probably even wealthy;
theft for the Artist is chiefly a pastime, though it may have also become a source
of livelihood. He is egotistical, motivated by whim or a desire for fame—if
not fame for himself, than for his crimes, since he probably will remain
anonymous.
<P></P>
    <B>Desperado:</B> For some reason or another, this character is running from the law—or,
perhaps even worse, the unwritten law of the underworld. In any case, he is ready and
willing to do whatever is necessary, however drastic, to preserve his life—he
knows all too well how soon its end may be. Delicacy and rational forethought
are not the forte of the Desperado. This is the sort of character that, when
discovered pickpocketing, might knife his target, lest his face be identified.
<P></P>
    The Desperado character may be of any social background, although poor is most
likely. His motivation is simple survival, and he may be found in any setting.
You must be certain that you know what circumstances have led to his
desperation. Desperadoes are often short-lived; either whatever's chasing them catches
up and gets them, or (rarely) they eliminate the threat and are able to shift to
a less high-strung lifestyle. The Desperado either dies or changes to
something else . . . though surely his old habits die hard.
<P></P>
    <B>Folk Hero:</B> When the system itself is unjust, those labeled &quot;criminals&quot; are sometimes in
fact the good guys. The Folk Hero will not sit idly by while tyrants rule. He
musters all his charisma and roguish skills, and leads the fight to right wrongs
and, if he can, topple the evil regime. Robin Hood is a Folk Hero of great
fame. According to legend he stole from the wealthy nobles and clergy, and gave
the money to the poor, overtaxed peasants.
<P></P>
    Robin Hood was of noble lineage, and his band did their work in the
countryside, but a Folk Hero could operate in any setting and be of any social
background. Imagine, for instance, a thief from the lower classes who lives in a city
ruled by an evil tyrant. He and his compatriots devote themselves to the freeing
of maltreated slaves and falsely convicted prisoners, smuggling them to safety
beyond the evil kingdom's borders. The chief motivation of the Folk Hero is, of
course, justice (or at least so it must appear to the public eye).
<P></P>
  <B>  Kleptomaniac:</B> The kleptomaniac is a character with a compulsion, perhaps entirely
uncontrollable, to steal. This compulsion might be at odds with the rest of the
character's personality; interesting role-playing may arise as the character has an
internal conflict between his driving desire to steal and a guilty conscience that
never stops telling him how wrong and evil his actions are. This character may
be of any background and setting. His motivation might be classified (very
loosely) as whim, since it lacks a rational reason.
<P></P>
    <B>Mobster:</B> This character was literally raised in crime. Perhaps he hails from a family
of elite criminals, leaders of organized crime. Over the years they have
developed their own codes of behavior and a twisted sense of honor. A mobster is
found in the city, and may be of any background. (Crime families may have
considerable wealth, but if their illegal activities are well known, or at least the
topic for common rumors, they may have considerably lower esteem in the eyes of
good citizens than those of comparable yet honestly-earned wealth.) His primary
motivation is usually greed or loyalty, and his alignment is most often lawful
neutral or lawful evil. Characters of this sort often make up the backbone of
the more powerful thieves' guilds.
<P></P>
    <B>The Professional:</B> Thievery is simply a job for this character. He is often aloof from other,
&quot;lesser&quot; thieves: He has little tolerance for flamboyant fools, like the Artist
and Trickster; Desperadoes and Kleptomaniacs, desperate and obsessed, are sloppy
and crude in comparison to his refined talents and balanced temperament; Folk
Heroes are just silly. The Vigilante is a dangerous foe for the Professional,
in part because he is incomprehensible to him. The Mobster would seem to be the
Professional's kindred spirit, but they are too tightly bound (in the
Professional's opinion) by honor and family loyalty and such trash. The Professional is
bound to no absolute codes, except perhaps a contract and a clean, efficient
theft. He has honor and honesty inasmuch as it is necessary to maintain his
reputation for dependability.
<P></P>
    The Professional's motivation is hard to pinpoint. Clearly it is neither
justice nor loyalty; and he knows that greed, whim and the lust for fame can cloud
judgement and lead to fatal sloppiness. Perhaps then &quot;survival&quot; would be the
best description of the Professional's motive; though any Professional worth his
salt does better than merely survive. Of all the archetypes, he is perhaps most
likely to have a businesslike, middle-class background, though any of the
others is possible. The Professional is usually based in a city, or wanders, and his
services are usually for hire. He may be associated with a guild, but would
prefer to be as independent as possible—other people's involvement in his work is
more often hindrance than help.
<P></P>
    <B>Street Urchin/Victim of Circumstances:</B> This thief grew up in an impoverished, harsh environment. There he learned
that if you need something you have to take it, because no one will give it to
you. People may tell him that stealing is wrong, but he cannot believe it—to him,
stealing has always meant survival. He long ago lost any sense of regret for
his actions. He was driven to a life of crime so long ago that it seems to him
the only life possible.
<P></P>
    This character invariably knows his setting (typically a city) inside and out,
and probably has many useful connections. His social background is always
lower class or unknown. Street Urchins that continue the thief's life may develop
into a different archetype as they grow older; the Professional, for instance,
may blossom from such a solitary young thief.
<P></P>
  <B>  Trickster:</B> This is a thrillseeker, a character who delights in pulling off the most
outrageous and amazing scams. Deception and pranks are his food and drink; flirting
with danger grants him an incomparable thrill. Thieves, such as Reynard the
Fox, are often portrayed this way in fairy and folk tales.
<P></P>
    In role-playing, you may wish to make a Trickster thief more complicated. Why
does he seem so light and frivolous? Does he hide something beneath it all? Is
he in fact driven, obsessed with proving himself the most clever of all? Such a
character could even become dangerous to those around him if his insecurities
were brought out and played upon. What if people are impressed by his antics?
What if they manage to outwit his pranks, or don't find them amusing? Does he
need attention, or is the thrill alone enough to satisfy him? Might the trickster
be cowed into quiet humility, or pushed into rage or frustration?
<P></P>
  <B>  Vigilante:</B> The Vigilante is a loner, a curious sort of thief whose life is preoccupied
with defeating the schemes of criminals. He finds the law too restrictive, or
unenforced, and so he goes outside it to bring about his vision of justice.
Ironically, the Vigilante trains himself in the very skills of the thieves he
opposes; he comes to know their ways and their minds as though he were one of them.
<P></P>
    Though he fights on the side of law, the law does not often appreciate the
Vigilante. He is unsupervised, unpredictable—and therefore dangerous. This is
especially true in the case of locales where the leadership is a bit on the shady
side itself, perhaps riddled with bribery, graft, connections with crime, and
other such corruption. The Vigilante leads a dangerous life, for he can have many
powerful enemies.
<P></P>
    On the other hand, the Vigilante may attain a revered status similar to that
of a Folk Hero, if his successes become popular knowledge. Popularity might do
little to ward off a powerful thieves' guild, but it can cow the more fearful of
public officials into tacit approval of his extralegal exploits.
<P></P>
    A Vigilante will, of course, not be part of a thieves' guild—that is his
antithesis. He may, however, be part of some secret society devoted to justice. Such
a society may consist entirely of Vigilante-type thieves, or it could include
adventurers of many diverse classes.
<P></P>
    The Vigilante may be of any social background. He might work in any setting, 
but the city is most common. His primary motivation is usually justice, but one
could imagine it being fame, loyalty (perhaps to comrades or relatives killed
or ruined by criminals), or possibly even whim.
<P></P>
    Some comic books do a great job of illustrating the complex psychologies found
in characters of the Vigilante archetype. They make excellent inspirational
reading.
