  This is the type of story that gets the old thieves talking late into the
night, sipping their mugs and reminiscing wistfully about the big job that they
never quite got around to.
<P></P>
     The great artifact is a unique object, a one of a kind wand or gem or statue
or anything else of tremendous worth. It is famed for its power (like a magic
item) or its symbolic value (like the crown jewels of a proud government) or
perhaps simply for its mindboggling worth financially (the mint or gold repository
of a powerful city-state, perhaps). Occasionally, an artifact will combine
features of all these types, and more. Objects labelled as &quot;artifacts&quot; in the AD&amp;D®
game system usually fall into this category.
<P></P>
    Whatever its nature, some generalities about the theft of the great artifact
apply. Its worth is fabulous. Although it may not be sought by <I>everyone</I>, there are plenty who would give anything to own it.
<P></P>
    The great artifact's acquisition should be a process requiring many gaming
sessions. Perhaps several additional quests are required before the theft of the
artifact can even begin—a key must be obtained before the magically warded chest
can be opened, for example.
<P></P>
    The protections of the artifact should be many, and their effectiveness should
increase the closer the PCs get to their goal. These barriers should ideally
include obstacles to the mental, as well as the physical, abilities of the
characters. Often a great deal of planning and coordination can be required of a
band of thieves, in order to pull off the theft everyone thought was impossible.
<P></P>
    Indeed, there might be a body of lore surrounding the artifact. Player
characters willing to do their homework might be able to find survivors of previous
expeditions, or at least hear tales handed down from earlier years. Such
cautionary tales, of course, may contain more fiction than fact. They may also be
couched in obscure language (as, for example: &quot;Beware the witching moon when the hog
walks upon the water&quot;), containing a meaning that only becomes clear when
certain conditions come to pass.
<P></P>
    The quest for the great artifact does not have to end with its acquisition, by
the way. Once its removal becomes public knowledge, any object of such great
value becomes the focus of attention for bounty hunters, master thieves, and
whoever had the object stolen to begin with. Especially in the case of potent
magic, the PCs might find themselves holding onto a lot more than they bargained
for.
