<P></P>
  How does this society view thieves? Are they vigorously exterminated wherever
they can be found? Are they encouraged to leave town by the closest available
gate? Or are they an integral part of the city's infrastructure, contributing to
its economic life every bit as directly (if not, perhaps, as constructively)
as the trading of merchants?
<P></P>
    The answers to these questions determine, to a great extent, what kind of
status a thief might hold in the society. Of course, status is almost always
enhanced by wealth, but a wealthy thief, in many societies, is still regarded as mere
scum, however cleansed and sanitized he may be on the surface.
<P></P>
    In areas where thieves are vigorously persecuted, thief characters will have
to operate almost entirely underground. Even the location of such a major
establishment of the thieves guild will be a carefully guarded secret. The guild
headquarters might move around frequently, changing locations at the first hint of
detection.
<P></P>
    Thieves in these types of societies will probably need to have several
alternate hideouts lined up, ready for use at a moment's notice. The number of thieves
working together, whether in a guild or a more informal band, will be small.
Paranoia among the members will be common, and even the hint of betrayal will
likely meet with gruesome consequences.
<P></P>
    Indeed, thieves in societies that strive to root them out will often be forced
to resort to a cover occupation or identity, simply to maintain appearances
with neighbors, casual acquaintances, and even curious members of the city watch.
The development of the cover can involve as much time and detail as player and
DM want to spend. In this type of culture, a thief's success at his cover can
affect his fortunes every bit as much as his performance on the job.
<P></P>
    While a cover provides a thief character with an inherent professional
weakness, it can also provide wonderful opportunities for roleplaying. Additionally, a
thief who works to preserve a cover might find himself working in an area that
is normally closed to thieves. This entails a corresponding increase in the
likelihood of encountering lucrative targets for theft. Also, there will often be
a relative lack of competition from other thieves in such an environment.
<P></P>
    Conversely, societies where thieves are at least tolerated, and those where
thieves are accorded rank of some status, present thief player characters with
other challenges. Because of the notoriously chaotic nature of the class, thieves
are constantly adjusting the status of members within their ranks. Thieves who
would succeed must struggle to stand out from the masses. Where every street
has its cutpurses and every neighborhood its petty boss, the thief PC will find
himself in the midst of savage competition. He will nearly always be forced to
choose sides. Although this selection can include the choice of independent
operations, of course, most thieves look upon those who are not declared friends
as undeclared enemies. Competition from other thieves and thief organizations
becomes a major conflict for these characters.
