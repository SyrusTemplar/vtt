  This small leather sheath is made to hold a knife or dagger, and is strapped
to the forearm (below the sleeve of a garment) so that the weapon can be flipped
to the hand by an arm movement and the blade readied for action. A dexterous
thief can work a blade into his hand by arm movements disguised in the context
of changing posture while sitting in a chair, or similar, seemingly innocuous
moves. Again, the obvious advantage is that of concealment.
<P></P>
    Variants on this theme are drop sheaths, which are usually sewn into leather
jackets or similar articles of clothing. Here, release of the dagger from the
sheath can be triggered by mechanical means (pressing a jacket sleeve stud, etc.)
or by muscular stimuli triggering pressure pads (tensing the biceps firmly
against the fist of the other arm, etc.).
