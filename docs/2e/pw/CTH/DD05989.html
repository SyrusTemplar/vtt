  This may be dropped on the floor, like aniseed, to put dogs off the scent when
pursuing a thief. It is less effective than aniseed, however, the pursuing dog
being allowed a saving throw vs. poison to avoid the effect of the dog pepper
absolutely. If the save is failed, though, the dog is unable to continue
pursuit for 1d4+1 turns.

    Dog pepper may more usefully be scattered into the air, a small packet holding
enough to fill a 10-foot cube. The pepper will hang in the air for 1d4 rounds
after being flung into it. A dog entering the area during this time gets no
saving throw to avoid the effect of the pepper. If dog pepper is thrown right into
a dog's face, the unfortunate animal gets no saving throw and becomes
hysterical for an hour, during which time it is totally uncontrollable.
