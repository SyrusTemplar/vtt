<P></P>
</B>
<P></P>
  <I>Description: </I>The consummate Burglar is an expert at breaking and entering the most
difficult buildings, bypassing walls, locks, traps and guardians, grabbing the best
loot, and escaping unnoticed as stealthily as he arrived.
<P></P>
    The cat Burglar requires a minimum Strength of 10 and Dexterity of 13.
<P></P>
  <I>  Role:</I> In many ways, the cat Burglar is the stereotypical professional thief. He
probably uses more of the traditional thief skills, and more frequently, than any
other kit.
<P></P>
    Even within the ranks of Burglars, thieves often specialize even further. Some
specialize by skills. A &quot;box-man,&quot; for instance, is an expert at opening
locks, especially safes and well-protected chests. A cat Burglar or second-story
thief specializes in climbing walls (which can be a remarkably effective
protection, especially if ground-level entrances have people around them). Teams of
Burglars who specialize by skill often find the most success.
<P></P>
    Other Burglars specialize by target. Jewel thieves in particular are the elite
among Burglars; the protection found around the objects of their attention
demands that their skills and cleverness be honed to perfection.
<P></P>
    Burglars of any background may be found. Even thrillseekers of the privileged
classes may take up jewel Burglary as a challenging, profitable, and exciting
pastime.
<P></P>
    Almost all successful Burglars have some sort of guild affiliation. In order
to get rid of the loot they take, they of course need a fence (especially if
their score is distinctive든.g., fabulous gems, valuable artwork). Guilds provide
the Burglar with innumerable benefits: fencing of even the most distinctive
items, connections with potential &quot;business&quot; partners, access to specialized
equipment, and, not least of all, protection. A guild can arrange the fix (to free
an imprisoned Burglar), and provide deterrence, protecting its Burglars from
other guilds and powerful criminals듫eople who don't take kindly to being robbed
themselves, and are more likely to make hasty decisions about a suspect
character's guilt or innocence.
<P></P>
<I>    Secondary Skills:</I> Any.
<P></P>
    <I>Weapon Proficiencies:</I> Better Burglars do not bring weapons with them on a job; it only means more
serious penalties if they are caught든ither legal penalties, or more immediate
ones like a jumpy victim panicking and attacking them. On some jobs, however
(e.g., stealing from dangerous criminals) a Burglar is wise to have means of
self-defense. Small, quiet, concealable weapons are naturally favored, though a
Burglar may choose proficiency in any weapon among those normally permitted to
thieves.
<P></P>
  <I>  Nonweapon Proficiencies:</I> Required: Alertness, Looting. Recommended: Begging, Gather Intelligence,
Jumping, Observation, Rope Use, Tightrope Walking, Tumbling.
<P></P>
    <I>Skill Progression: The</I> vital skills of a Burglar are open locks, find/remove traps, move silently,
hide in shadows, detect noise and climb walls. As mentioned before, a Burglar
may concentrate particularly on one of these, but he would probably then want to
be as evenly excellent as possible in the others.
<P></P>
    <I>Equipment: </I>Burglars love to use specialized hardware to increase their chances of
success. For a thorough examination of some specialty items available, and their
effects on thief skills, consult the equipment chapter later in this book.
<P></P>
    <I>Special Benefits:</I> None.
<P></P>
    <I>Special Hindrances:</I> None.
<P></P>
    <I>Races:</I> Members of any race may be Burglars, and it is a favorite kit. Non-human
thieves often specialize in areas that offer excellent racial bonuses. For
instance, dwarves may specialize in lockpicking and trap detection. And elves may
specialize in reconnaissance (they sneak around and report on the presence and
nature of obstacles).
<P></P>

<P></P>
<B>The Specialist Burglar
<P></P>
</B>
<P></P>
  A broad, general range of skills is often what adventurers choose, but for the
urban Burglar, specialization is the way to go. There are a number of reasons
for this.
<P></P>
    A specialized thief is simply more marketable. People in the underworld want
someone excellent for a job. That may mean a high-level generalized thief, one
who has been in the business long enough to be good at everything. But it's not
easy for a thief to reach that level. Therefore, by concentrating on one skill,
a relatively low-level thief may compete with a thief many levels higher for
jobs of a certain type.
<P></P>
    Suppose, for instance, we have a &quot;box-man&quot;드ctually a woman듩amed Annelise. By
concentrating as many points as possible in her open locks skill, she can have
a score of 85% at only 4th level (this does not include modifiers for race,
Dexterity, armor or kit). Since she can put no more than half of what she earns
at each level into any one skill, she distributes her remaining points more or
less evenly among the other skills. She would probably neglect pick pockets and
read languages, however, since they usually are not useful to a Burglar.
<P></P>
    Compare this to a &quot;generalist&quot; thief, which adventurers tend to be: On Table
19 of the <I>Dungeon Master's Guide</I> (Thief Average Ability Table), you can see that Annelise's level of
lockpicking skill would not be attained before 14th level.
<P></P>
    Now imagine that a mob of jewel thieves is preparing for a job. They have
diverse skills든xcept that they are lousy at lock-picking. They need to bring a
box-man into their mob. Who would they choose? Well, first off, a 14th-level thief
is pretty bloody rare.
<P></P>
  And even if one were available and willing to work with less-experienced
thieves, he would probably demand a larger share of the take. Otherwise it would not
be worth his time: He has uniformly good skills, and could probably commit
this robbery on his own. A job with which he would need assistance is probably
well out of the range of these thieves.
<P></P>
    Annelise, then, is a pretty attractive option. She might be able to climb
little better than a fish, but that's the cat Burglar's expertise; after he's
mounted the building, he can lower a rope for the less sure-footed. By offering
Annelise a reasonable share of the loot, the other Burglars are almost assured that
their difficult lock will be opened.
