  Why is the thief what he is? You can ask this question even before you know
specifically what his area of expertise or technical interest is. A person
primarily motivated by greed could be a troubleshooter or a cat burglar, for
instance, provided the job pays well.
<P></P>
    We suggest six basic motivations: fame (or infamy), greed, justice, loyalty,
survival, and whim. These are of course generalizations, and any particular
character probably has motivations more complex than one of these simple
descriptions. Also, characters often have more than one motivation, and different
motivations can apply to different situations.
<P></P>
    This may sound so convoluted that you may wonder why we should even approach
the issue. It is useful to choose a basic motivation, however, as the basis for
role-playing. As you play the character, more motivations will arise—and old
ones may vanish. In this way a character may come to life.
<P></P>
    A character who starts with the greed motivation may, in the course of his
adventures, encounter a great deal of injustice wrought by the rulers of the land.
He may even trace his own selfishness to the perverted values of the rulers.
As he organizes his activities to oppose the rulers, then, his motivation may
subtly swing towards justice. It is unlikely, however, that he would be so
&quot;converted&quot; as to lose entirely the greed that drove him for so long. New conflicts
and role-playing opportunities may arise within the character between his greed
and his new-found sense of justice.
<P></P>
    Be sure to keep your character's motivations in mind when you select his
alignment. The description below of each general motivation includes a word on
appropriate, related alignments. Note also that as the character develops in play
and motivation shifts, alignment too may undergo change. (For a thorough
discussion of alignment changes, see the AD&amp;D® 2nd Edition <I>Player's Handbook</I>, <A HREF="../PHB/DD01521.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01521.html">p. 49</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, and the<I> Dungeon Master's Guide</I>, <A HREF="../DMG/DD00280.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../DMG/DD00280.html">pp. 28-29</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">.)
<P></P>
    The motivation description may also include suggestions on thief kits
appropriate to this motivation. The thief kits are fully detailed in Chapter 3.
<P></P>
  <B>  Fame/Infamy:</B> The fabled charm of a thief's life attracts many an adventurer in search of
glory. In our own real world, many thieves have achieved great fame, and in
literature even more such figures abound. Infamy surely accompanies the career of
many a successful thief; for some it may even be their ultimate goal. If this is
the case with your character, you must be certain to bring it out while
role-playing. Every action should be considered in terms of how it may increase the
world's knowledge of the thief's amazing exploits.
<P></P>
  <B>Greed:</B> The simplest and perhaps most stereotypical motive behind the thief's life is
greed. Combining greed with sloth, the thief shuns &quot;real&quot; work, and lightens
his load by lightening others' purses. Or, the character simply loves wealth,
but is unable to get it through acceptable channels.
<P></P>
    Characters with greed as their primary motivation surely would not be of good
alignment. Although even good thieves may have a certain element of greed, it
would not be the biggest factor shaping their lives.
<P></P>
    <B>Justice:</B> This is a rare and peculiar motivation, since thieves are generally
considered to be anything but good. The classic example of the thief motivated by
justice is Robin Hood—at least as popularly portrayed, if not in historical reality.
Such a character must arise in a region or nation where injustice rules, though
it need not do so officially. For instance, in one town the rulers may be
blatantly evil and corrupt; a thief motivated by justice may devote himself to
fighting those rulers.
<P></P>
    Characters motivated by justice will probably be of good, lawful neutral, or
true neutral alignments. Remember that each alignment has its own idea of what
constitutes &quot;justice&quot;; to a true neutral thief, for instance, justice means
maintaining the balances between good and evil, law and chaos.
<P></P>
  <B>  Loyalty:</B> Some connection in the character's past has drawn him onto the road of the
thief, and he follows it faithfully out of loyalty or debt to that past. For
instance, one character might have been born into a family of crimelords; he became
a thief as a matter of family loyalty. Another thief may have been an orphan,
sheltered and raised by the thieves' guild. Even though his moral sensibilities
may lead him to question his benefactors' and even his own behavior, his
loyalty and gratitude for the life and opportunity they gave him may (at least for
the moment) outweigh his doubts.
<P></P>
    Loyalty is most appropriate as the primary motivation of lawful characters.
The conflicts of loyalty versus moral imperatives may lead to some very
interesting role-playing.
<P></P>
    <B>Survival:</B> Many thieves from the lower strata of society engage in theft and the like
for the simple purpose of survival. Player-character adventurers are prone to
garner more wealth than they need for mere survival, so (unless the Dungeon Master
works diligently to keep them poor) they might need a new motivation after a
few successful adventures. Probably a secondary motivation (such as greed, or
even justice) would come to the fore and become primary.
<P></P>
    Thieves who steal for survival usually don't have lawful alignments, though
lawful evil is possible.
<P></P>
    <B>Whim:</B> Some thieves engage in their activities for the sheer thrill of it. They can
survive (materially) without it, they don't need or desire the money as such,
and they are indifferent to fame. They simply desire to steal, to deceive
people, to pull off the most impossible heist or scam—this grants them supreme
pleasure. Whim-motivated thieves range from the ennui-stricken rich man's son to the
compulsive shoplifter whose desire to steal may push him to the very edge of
sanity.
<P></P>
    This motivation is most appropriate for chaotic alignments.
