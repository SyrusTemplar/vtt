  The cultural overview of the campaign setting is an important consideration
for the adventuring careers of all PCs, none more so than the thief. Some
cultures have a strong and deep-running tradition of thievery while others will be
quite foreign to the concept.
<P></P>
    Generally, the more primitive a civilization, the less the likelihood of a
strong thief element within it. Savage tribesmen or aborigines, of course, have
few possessions that a thief would deem worth stealing. While characters from
these backgrounds might covet the possessions of other cultures, their methods of
acquisition will be less subtle than those of a ``civilized'' thief.
<P></P>
    Of course, nothing prohibits a character from a savage or barbarian background
from joining the thief class. Ideally, the character will have the opportunity
to learn a little about his chosen trade before he meets up with an
experienced city watch patrol.
<P></P>
    Rural cultures, too, will be less likely to provide interesting settings for
thief adventures than will urban locales. Thief characters can of course learn
their trades in small town or country settings, but unless they have a steady
stream of travelers passing through from which to select their victims, such
thieves will have difficulty maintaining a career of any long duration.
<P></P>
    But perhaps an even more significant cultural consideration is the view of
that culture towards personal property and an honest day's labor. It is in this
context that a city, with a strong class of merchants, an important economic
system, and a reliance upon trade, becomes the ideal setting for the thief's
activities.
<P></P>
    The culture of such a bustling city cannot help but give rise to laws and law
enforcers, to objects of value, and to interesting inhabitants. All of these
items, as they relate to the thief's activities and opportunities, are discussed
below.
