  This is an obvious distinction. A guildmaster can be strong and authoritative,
so that his commands and rules are obeyed (willingly or otherwise). Or he may
be weak, with his edicts increasingly challenged by his underlings. Factors
such as Charisma, experience level, notable achievements, age, and the like will
affect the guildmaster's perceived strength. The most important, however, is
likely to be the general perception of the force the guildmaster has up his sleeve.
