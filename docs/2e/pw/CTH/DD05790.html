  This is the specialized skill of making locks. It is treated like other
&quot;craft&quot; proficiencies when checking for success. Also, thieves with this proficiency
gain a 10% bonus to their lockpicking skill, because they are intimately
familiar with the internal structure and working of so many locks.
<P></P>
    Besides troubleshooters, dwarf and gnome thieves of any kit can take the
locksmithing proficiency to fill one slot, because of the tradition of craftsmanship
and mechanical things in their cultural heritages.
