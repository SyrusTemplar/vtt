  Bows are very useful for thieves, but are very hard to conceal because of
their size and shape. A folding bow solves this problem, dividing neatly in half
when unstrung, making it a much more suitable size and allowing concealment—for
example, in a thigh sheath. Only short bows have folding-bow equivalents.

    The joint in the middle of the bow weakens it, however, reducing the effective
ranges to S 4, M 8, L 13, and also making it -1 on damage rolls (but any hit
causes at least one point of damage).
