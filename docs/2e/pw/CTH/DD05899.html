  This is of most importance within the guild. The guildmaster may be cruel,
handing down stiff (and sometimes arbitrary) punishments for infringements of
guild rules. He may punish any signs of over-ambition among juniors very sternly. A
cruel guildmaster rules his guild by fear of what he does—this is crucially
different from a strong guildmaster, who may rule in part by fear of what he
could do if opposed. A just guildmaster is the opposite of this, but is not weak.
That is, he is known to act swiftly and decisively to oppose any enemies within
the guild, and to enforce important guild rules and rulings. However, his
punishments are seen as fair and justified (&quot;he's harsh but he's fair&quot;). While the
opposite of cruel would, strictly, be &quot;kindly,&quot; nice guys do not get to be
guildmasters.
