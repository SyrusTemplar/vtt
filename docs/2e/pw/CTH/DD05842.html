  This is just as important as paying dues. The guild member will be expected to
keep the identity of the guildmaster (if he knows it), the guildhouse, and
planned guild activities secret from outsiders. He must never inform on a guild
member.
<P></P>
    In a guild dominated by a lawfully-aligned guildmaster or group, secrecy may
be the most important of all commitments the guildmember has to make. Some form
of oath of loyalty is very likely to be demanded of the novice in almost any
thieves' guild.
