  This plotline works most effectively for small groups of player characters, or
even individuals. More complex evolutions can involve large groups, all
cooperating on an intelligence-gathering mission, but these are harder to run and
more confusing to play.

    Perhaps more than any other, a spying storyline allows the DM to draw upon a
vast store of novels, films, and other media. Plotlines involving spies, even
when set outside the fantasy area, can often be converted into challenging
roleplaying situations. Substitute a <I>crystal ball</I> for satellite reconnaissance, <I>clairaudience</I> for a phone tap, and a<I> flying carpet</I> for a helicopter, and you will be able to reproduce many a modern thriller in
an AD&amp;D® game setting and format.

    The spy storyline offers another advantage to many players in that it serves
as a non-evil alternative for thief player characters. Of course, spies can be
evil, but a spy may also be motivated by grander ambitions than perhaps the
common thief. A character or group sent to infiltrate the ranks of a menacing
warlord or bandit king can perform great service for the good of society if they can
succeed in their mission.
