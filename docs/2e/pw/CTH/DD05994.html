<P></P>
  This is a general term for any powder which is highly abrasive, irritating to
the eyes, and disabling to the victim as a result. Powdered stone, pepper, dust
soaked in onion juice, and strong ammonium salts—blinding powder can be made
from many ingredients.
<P></P>
    Blinding powder is only useful if it is thrown right into the eyes of a
victim. This counts as a called shot (<I>Dungeon Master's Guide</I>, p.58) with an additional (doubled) penalty, for a total of -8 on the attack
roll.  the Dexterity bonus of the person throwing the powder applies to the
attack roll. Further, the base AC of the target ignores any armor or shield used,
save for the use of a helmet or helm; magical protection such as <I>bracers of defense</I> or a <I>ring of protection</I> protect the target, as does Dexterity (unless the attack has an element of
surprise).
<P></P>
    If blinding powder strikes a victim the effects are the same as those of the <I>stinking cloud</I> spell save that they last for 2d4+2 rounds and no saving throw is allowed. If
the victim can wash his eyes with plenty of water, the effect will only last
for one round after the eyes are washed. Although blinding powder can contain
some unpleasant ingredients, it has no permanently damaging effects on the eyes.
