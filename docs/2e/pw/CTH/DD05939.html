  New followers may arrive, and a monthly check should be made for this. The
chance is 10% for each 10 (or part thereof) thieves already in the guild—for
example, a guild with 27 thieves has a 30% chance each month of attracting a new
follower. Modifiers to this base percentage chance are shown in Table 26.

Table 26:
<P></P>
MODIFIERS TO FOLLOWERS DICE ROLL
<P></P>
</B>
<P></P>
Morale, per point above 15: +10%
<P></P>
Morale, per point below 10: -10%
<P></P>
Guildmaster's Charisma: +2% per point above 12
<P></P>
Society is Rich: +10%
<P></P>
Society is Wealthy: +5%
<P></P>
Society is Poor: -5%
<P></P>
Society is Very Poor: -20%
<P></P>

<P></P>
  Whatever the final percentage chances, no more than two new thieves will
arrive in any single month. New arrivals are 1st-level apprentices, with the usual
chance for being nonhuman and possibly multi-classed. The DM may allow greater
chances for new recruits if the guildmaster goes on a recruiting drive after the
guild has been weakened by arrests or some similar misfortune.
