  This is mostly a temporary state of affairs, when the guildmaster has just
died, the ruling council been arrested, and the like. However, in a very few
guilds this may be a permanent state of affairs. Here, the guild will carry on only
a few of the usual functions, and will primarily act only as a practical
resource. Thus, the guild house will be somewhere to find a trainer, buy equipment,
and gossip with fellow thieves. Guild dues will not be excessive, and they will
be paid for reasons of pragmatism. However, regulation of thiefly activities
will be minimal or non-existent.

    A leaderless guild is ripe for a coup, of course, and again this be a good
option for the DM!
