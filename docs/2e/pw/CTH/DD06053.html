  Whether or not to place a guild in your campaign setting is a decision central
to the gaming careers of your thief player characters. Guilds can provide many
interesting conflicts, and also require a certain amount of DM commitment in
order to exist believably in a campaign world.
<P></P>
    Consequently, the creation of a guild is not a decision to be taken lightly.
Of course, they are more or less standard in many gaming environments, and if
everyone in the campaign expects there to be a thieves guild, there probably
should be a guild.
<P></P>
    Thieves guilds can provide many opportunities for adventure, as detailed in
Chapter 4: Thieves Guilds. Many of the ideas there can be used in creating a
guild for your own campaign environment.
<P></P>
    Remember also, should you decide not to have a guild in your own campaign
world, that the absence of a guild does not mean there aren't plenty of thieves
running around out there, looking for their share of the spoils and working
actively to defend their &quot;turf.&quot;
