  Here, bribes and backhanders are paid to officers of the law on a regular and
major basis. Not all lawmen may be corrupt, but a thief with serious financial
resources can manage to avoid being charged with almost anything. If somehow he
ends up in prison, he will be smuggled out somehow. Law officers may actually
be members of the thieves' guild, cooperating with smuggling, protection
rackets, and the like.

    There is a tendency to overplay this, and to make it too obvious to PCs.
Corrupt law enforcers aren't going to advertise the fact, even in a corrupt society,
save for the most stupidly sociopathic. Corruption may be extensive, but will
still be significantly behind the scenes, making it more deadly for the
unfortunate outsider who blunders into it. Lawfully-aligned PCs can arouse the ire
(and even the violent attentions) of corrupt officers of the law they attempt to
&quot;assist&quot; with their work!
