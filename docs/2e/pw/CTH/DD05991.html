  These come in various forms, but a common design is one with swivelling heels.
The heel of the boot is grasped and twisted firmly toward the inside surface.
The heel swivels and reveals a small, hollow compartment within the boot. These
compartments are very small, and will typically only hold one gem of moderate
size or up to four small ones. The design of the boot is such that there is not
an externally visible built-up heel, but nonetheless a thief wearing these
boots suffers a -5 penalty to any move silently rolls he has to make.
