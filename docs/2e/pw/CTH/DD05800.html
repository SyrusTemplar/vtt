  Are you tired of playing plain, old, pick-a-few-pockets-and-open-a-few-locks
thieves, even if AD&amp;D® 2nd Edition makes them slightly more interesting than
their predecessors? Do you want still more interest, more variety—but don't want
to worry about working out all the details yourself? Then the thief kits may be
just the thing for you.
<P></P>
    Here we will show you how to create and play all sorts of thieves. They are
presented in kits. Each kit defines a particular type of thief—his
characteristics, abilities, and limitations. You are also invited to design your own kits,
and we include suggestions on how you might do this.
