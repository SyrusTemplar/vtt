  These are standard trappings for any self-respecting swindler. There are no
rules for gambling in AD&amp;D® 2nd Edition, however, so the DM has two options.
First, he can write his own. Second, the simple rule-of-thumb rules suggested here
can be used.
<P></P>
    If the Gaming proficiency is being used, use of suitably marked cards or
biased dice allows a -1 modifier to the d20 check (remember that proficiencies work
when low dice rolls are made).
<P></P>
    If the game is actually being played out and the Gaming proficiency not used,
then the thief PC is allowed (in effect) to replace any one card drawn or die
thrown if he has the suitable prop and if a Dexterity test is made. Thus, if the
PC is playing blackjack and has drawn a king and a five, the effect of using
marked cards is simulated by allowing a redraw on one card, if the player wishes
to do so (in this case, the five, in all likelihood). When rolling the
Dexterity test, if the d20 roll is 18+ the thief has been seen cheating (even if he
makes the Dexterity test successfully). For obvious reasons, the DM should roll
this test in secret!
