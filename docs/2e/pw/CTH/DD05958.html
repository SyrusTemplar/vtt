  Picking a lock takes 1d10 rounds, as stated in the <I>Player's Handbook</I>. If the thief has no lockpicks or is using improvised lockpicks, this
duration becomes 1d20 rounds.
<P></P>
    Other ways of bypassing locks take rather longer. Using a lock chisel and
hammer takes one turn; metal-eating acid takes 3d6 rounds; cutting around a lock
takes 2d6 turns (assuming that the door is a wooden one of average thickness);
cutting through a lock takes 3d6 turns. The DM may roll randomly for time needed,
or may select a value within the range shown which reflects the quality and
size of the lock. Size will most affect acid and cutting round a lock, whereas
quality will affect cutting through a lock, as regards time needed.
