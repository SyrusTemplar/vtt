  A player may decide that he doesn't want to have his thief PC join any guild;
this may be especially likely with Chaotic characters (and Chaotic players!).
It's best not to pressure the player in this case, but as his thief PC gains
experience he will inevitably tread on the toes of the thieves' guild (e.g., by
robbing someone they have an &quot;understanding&quot; with). The guild will sooner or
later have to take action against the PC thief. They will warn him first, and
stress the benefits of joining (as explained above). Eventually he will have to join
up, or ship out. There is also the matter of training, of course; if he
doesn't get this from the guild, where else can he come by it?
<P></P>
    Some players may worry that their thief PCs may have their freedom of action
massively curtailed, or their alignment may be compromised (especially if the PC
is of Good alignment), or their PC may simply be ripped off. These are
legitimate worries, and some players may want to be reassured about them. The DM
should be able to lure all but the most uncooperative player into guild membership
without any strong-arm tactics, and then the full plethora of the guild's
nefarious activities can be unfolded . . .
