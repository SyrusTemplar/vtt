  Analogous to the use of charcoal in dim lighting, a thief can use plant dyes
(crushed leaves, berries, certain oily barks, etc.) to disguise his exposed face
and hands and add a further +2% to his hide in shadows chance in suitable
outdoor settings. Such plant materials are usually rather sticky and smelly,
