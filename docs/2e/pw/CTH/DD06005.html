  This exotic title is a catchall for specially modified boots which have
concealed blades within them. The blades have to be small, of course; they are
usually little bigger than modern-day razor blades. They are usually concealed in
secret compartments in the heels of boots (see Hollow Boots above), but slender
blades can even be hidden in the soles of boots. Such blades are of little use as
weapons, but can be used to slit pouches and purses, to cut ropes, and for
similar tasks.
