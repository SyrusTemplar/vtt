</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">  The basic healing proficiency rules for poison, from the <I>Player's Handbook</I>, are as follows.
<P></P>
    A character with healing proficiency can attempt to aid a poisoned individual,
provided the poison entered through a wound. If the poisoned character can be
tended immediately (the round after the character is poisoned) and the care
continues for the next five rounds, the victim gains a +2 to his saving throw
(delay his saving throw until the last round of tending). No proficiency check is
required, but the poisoned character must be tended to immediately (normally by
sacrificing any other action by the proficient character) and cannot do
anything himself. If the care and rest are interrupted, the poisoned character must
immediately roll a normal saving throw for the poison. This result is unalterable
by normal means (i.e., more healing doesn't help). Only characters with both
healing and herbalism proficiencies can attempt the same treatment for poisons
the victim has swallowed or touched (the character uses his healing to diagnose
the poison and his herbalist knowledge to prepare a purgative.)
<P></P>
    Note that these rules concern antidotes only obliquely, through the herbalism
proficiency in instances of ingestive and contact poisoning.
