  Although thieves and bards are both rogues, they have no need of extensive
contacts. While bardic colleges train bards in some rogue skills which thieves
also possess, this is really to be seen as part of the jack-of-all-trades range of
talents the bard possesses. Bards don't think like thieves, and they don't
behave like them. Perhaps the closest these two groups come to direct dealings is
when a neutral evil bard becomes an assassin and the assassins' guild has good
relations with the thieves' guild!
