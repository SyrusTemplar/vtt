  These are essential for the thief to use this skill at anything like his
&quot;natural&quot; ability level. It is these items which are listed in the <I>Player's Handbook</I> as Thieves' Picks, costing 30 gp. They are usually short lengths of rigid
wire and flat, narrow plates of iron or steel, especially designed and made for
dealing with locks, and there will be a dozen or so to a set. They will be
supplied either on a ring (like keys) or in a cloth or leather wallet which unrolls.
These items will never be freely available on the open market.
