  This can be done in three ways. First, the tables in the <I>Player's Handbook</I> can be used (with tweaking to reduce the proportion of non-humans if this is
too large for your campaign). Second, you can use tables (71, 12, 13) earlier
in this book (the 11-15 row is suggested from Table 17). Or you can use one of
the systems, and introduce a few pet, individually scripted NPC thieves of your
own into the results from the dice rolls. In particular, you may wish to design
the deputy (assistant) guildmaster since this will be an NPC the PC will need
to lean on a lot.
