<P></P>
  This section introduces rules of advanced complexity that players and DMs may
wish to use in the campaign. While they are recommended for use in a gaming
environment where thieves are common, they are not exclusively limited to the
thief character.
<P></P>
    As an exception to this generality, those optional rules that modify specific
thief activities are, of course, useable only by thieves.
<P></P>
    New rules are provided for lock and trap construction, removal, and
modification; for specific animal training, tricks common and useful to thieves; to
amplify the poison rules presented in the AD&amp;D® 2nd Edition <I>Dungeon Master's Guide</I>; to allow thieves to possibly knock out a victim with a surprise blow from
the rear; and to detail the encumbrance effects when armored characters attempt
to perform acrobatics.
