  This is a strongly organized guild, where all guild members have a powerful
primary loyalty to the guildmaster. Loyalty is mostly high, the guildmaster is
usually a powerful and dominant figure, and the guild house is a major meeting
place. Thieves from such a guild will work with a notable degree of co-ordination.
