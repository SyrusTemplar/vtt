  Thieves often have reason to evade detection or pursuit. Some of their skills
(hiding in shadows, moving silently) are tailored toward this end. Equipment
detailed here includes further aids to evasion, items to assist in avoiding
detection, and even an item or two to enable the thief to whistle innocently if he
is found and apprehended at the scene of the crime.
