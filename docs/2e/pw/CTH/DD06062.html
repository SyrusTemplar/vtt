  Like any good campaign, the level of magic in use is a function of the
players' and DM's desires, the cultural setting, and perhaps to an extent the
experience levels of the PCs. Much of this decision should be based on the magical
capabilities of the PCs (whether or not the thieves have a wizard working with
them, for example) and the degree of reward to be gained by overcoming magical
challenges.
<P></P>
    In general, most challenges to thief PC missions should be found in forms the
characters can cope with: mechanical traps instead of magical ones, for
example, provide a better gaming obstacle to thieves.
<P></P>
    However, a DM can certainly employ magical traps to protect things he doesn't
want the PCs to get their hands on. Also, such traps add an element of tension
to a mission that helps keep everyone on their toes. A mission of thievery
involving an intrusion into the lair of some powerful wizard should <I>always</I> have an air of magical, mysterious danger.
