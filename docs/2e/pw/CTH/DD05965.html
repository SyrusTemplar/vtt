  There may be exceptional variants on this—for example, if a thief knows that
he needs to hide in shadows amongst the crimson curtains of a lady's boudoir he
might use a crimson set of clothing. Apart from such singular special cases,
there are two general types of camouflage clothing the thief will find useful in
various situations.
<P></P>
    <B>Darksuit</B>: This comprises black or very deep blue clothes, usually fairly voluminous
robes or what might be termed a &quot;utility suit.&quot; Such clothing will usually be
lightweight so it can be carried about easily, and worn under normal clothing if
needs be. It will always include significant facial covering. If such a suit is
worn, it will add +5% to a hide in shadows chance in any area which is shadowy,
has a light level equal to dusk or early dawn, or equivalent.
<P></P>
    <B>Woodland Suit:</B> This has a similar basic design to a darksuit but is made of light clothing
dyed in irregular patterns of greens and browns. It adds +5% to the hide in
shadows chance when the thief attempts to conceal himself in any suitable outdoors
setting such as woodland, a field, or the garden of a town house.
