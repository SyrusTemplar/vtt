<P></P>
</B>
<P></P>
  <I>Description:</I> This is probably the most common sort of thief—the pickpocket or shoplifter
who engages in small-time larceny, usually at a level of meager subsistence. He
often supplements his income by working as an informant for the powerful
figures of the underworld (or anyone else who's willing to pay).
<P></P>
    The Cutpurse has no requirements beyond those of the thief class.
<P></P>
    <I>Role:</I> The Cutpurse is near the bottom of the underworld hierarchy. His activities
are not as risky as those of other thieves, but are they are not as profitable
either.
<P></P>
    Many Cutpurses are &quot;freelancers,&quot; not associated with any thieves' guild.
Guilds, normally harsh on non-member thieves who operate in their territory, pay
little attention to Cutpurses. The profit and benefits that would accrue from
their membership would not outweigh the trouble of trying to bring them into line.
For this reason many chaotic thieves, who may dislike the structure and
limitations of guild membership, choose the Cutpurse kit.
<P></P>
    Cutpurses are not always uncooperative, however. Some do join guilds, which
they serve primarily as informants and tipsters, ears on the streets, catching
gossip and scoping out prospective targets that can then be assigned to other
thieves.
<P></P>
    Cutpurses who don't belong to a guild often form their own little mob. Such a
small mob usually develops a standard modus operandi (way of operating), and
they use the same scam on every target. They may also design special, elaborate
plans for lifting a particularly heavy purse. Cutpurses also may enlist the
assistance of thieves of other kits in their operations (see the Beggar kit, above,
for an example).
<P></P>
    Suppose, for instance, that one thief has the job of accosting an
affluent-looking stranger, whom the Cutpurses have guessed to be an out-of-town merchant.
This first thief presents himself as a street-vendor. While he tries to sell the
merchant a hot pastry, a second thief comes by carrying a large load (perhaps
a basket full of dirty sheets), which he &quot;accidentally&quot; drops on or around the
merchant. In the chaos that ensues, the first two thieves appear to help the
merchant, picking up the fallen items and apologizing profusely; while a third
Cutpurse does the actual job of relieving the merchant of his cash.
<P></P>
    Like beggars, most Cutpurses are of lower-class background and are born into
their station.
<P></P>
    <I>Secondary Skills:</I> Usually (90%) none.
<P></P>
    <I>Weapon Proficiencies:</I> Small, concealable weapons are ideal for Cutpurses, though they are not
formally restricted any more than thieves in general.
<P></P>
    <I>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</I> Required: Observation, Trailing, Recommended: Alertness, Begging, Gather
Intelligence, Trailing.
<P></P>
  <I>  Skill Progression:</I> Cutpurses naturally specialize in picking pockets. Beyond this, they
typically favor moving silently and hiding in shadows, as these may increase their
pickpocketing talents.
<P></P>
    <I>Equipment:</I> A few special items to aid in picking pockets are noted in the equipment
chapter (p. 90). If thieves have connections, they may be able to purchase such
items.
<P></P>
    <I>Special Benefits:</I> The effective pickpocket is one who can choose his target carefully. He must
learn to ascertain the nature of a prospective victim. How dangerous will the
attempt be? What could the target do in response? And does the chance of
financial reward out weigh the risks involved?
<P></P>
    In game terms, this means that the Cutpurse has the ability to guess the class
and level of another character. If the pickpocket makes a successful
observation proficiency check, he can accurately determine the target's character class.
<P></P>
    Another proficiency check can be made to determine the approximate level of
the character. The DM should roll this check secretly. If the check fails, the
difference between the number rolled and the number needed for success is how far
off the character's estimate is.
<P></P>
    Sometimes a Cutpurse will &quot;check out&quot; a character who is in disguise. When
this happens, the Cutpurse suffers a penalty of -5 on his proficiency check.
<P></P>
<I>    Example:</I> Gorgar the Cutpurse is eyeing an opulent-looking foreigner. Gorgar succeeds
in his first observation check, and determines that the man is a wizard. This
could be dangerous, he thinks, and he tries to guess how powerful the wizard is.
<P></P>
    Gorgar needs to roll a 13 or lower for a successful observation check. The DM
rolls the dice secretly for him, and gets a 16. This means that Gorgar's
estimate will be 3 levels off.
<P></P>
    The wizard is in fact 4th level. The DM decides that, because of the mage's
rich dress, Gorgar overestimates the character's level. &quot;You guess that the
wizard is around 7th level,&quot; says the DM. (Note that characters don't speak in terms
of character levels; the thief would have information in less precise terms;
but speaking about levels is clearer for communication among players.)
<P></P>
    If the DM wished, he could have determined randomly if Gorgar over- or
underestimated (e.g., roll 1d6; 1-3: over, 4-6 under).
<P></P>
    <I>Special Hindrances:</I> The main hindrance to Cutpurses is that thieves of other kits look down on
them, considering them small-time thieves, just half a step above Beggars. This
is something the DM should bring out in role-playing—Cutpurse thieves will have
difficulty commanding a lot of respect in the underworld.
<P></P>
    <I>Races:</I> Cutpurses may come from any race. Half-elves and halflings particularly favor
this kit; as do, to a lesser extent, elves.
