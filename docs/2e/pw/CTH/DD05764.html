  The world of the thief is a world of darkness and stealth, hidden from the
eyes of respectable folk, yet often under the scrutiny of the zealous enforcers of
the law. It is a world of courage and fear, of bravado and cowardice, of
violence and treachery.
<P></P>
    Yet it is also a world of color and laughter, lively parties and bustling
markets. The thief, more than any other character class, practices his arts among
his fellow men (or halflings, or elves, or whatever). He seeks the gatherings of
population, the confluence of wealth and avarice, where treasures are there
for the taking.
<P></P>
    To be sure, many a thief has proven his worth time and again in the darkest
reaches of a forgotten dungeon, among the snowy peaks of the bleakest of wild
vistas, or within the halls of a fortress or military camp. Quests into the wild
contain as much appeal for the thief as they do for other characters. In fact,
should the prospect of treasure appear significant enough, many a thief will
lead the way in encouraging his companions to embark on such a mission.
<P></P>
    But when the adventurers return to the sheltering walls of their homes,
wherever these may be, and rejoin the population, the thief is best equipped to find
adventure there. And when such adventure is discovered, it is thiefly skills
that are most often called into play.
