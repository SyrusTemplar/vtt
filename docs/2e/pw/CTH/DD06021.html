  Forgery may also be a swindler's calling, including counterfeiting.
Interestingly, forgery was not a serious crime in the middle ages; barter took precedence
above coinage or credit notes, and it's hard to counterfeit a bushel of wheat
or forge livestock.
<P></P>
    As the Renaissance came, however, and banking developed, so did the forger's
art—and the punishments became serious. As late as the first half of the 19th
century in England, men and women were hanged for the crime of forging one-pound
notes.

    The value of forgery, therefore, and the risks involved, will depend on the
nature of commerce and trade in your campaign.
