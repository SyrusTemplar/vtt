  These are strips of wood, usually around 4 to 6 inches long and an inch or so
high, and very thin. They are also very tough, however, being made of very
resilient wood (like limewood, although other, similar woods can be used) and often
coated on one or both sides with a very thin coat of toughening varnish.
Limewood strips are slipped between a door and its door frame so that the thief can
raise a latch on the other side of the door and open it normally (possibly
after picking a lock). A normal latch can be opened, but a bar is too strong for a
limewood strip to lift.
