These are the toughest elves around (and the most quintessentially elven), for
they rely on skill rather than muscle. Although warrior/thieves may not be
truly adept with any weapon, their thief skills more than make up for that.
Fighter/thieves are very useful in a campaign based more on subtlety than force.
