</B>Although not actually a mage/thief, the elven minstrel kit that originally
appeared in <I>The Complete Bard's Handbook</I> has characteristics of both classes. In the interest of conserving space, it
is not reprinted here. This elf version of the bard does exist for those who
have been yearning to play just such a character.
