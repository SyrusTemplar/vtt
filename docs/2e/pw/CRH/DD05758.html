   There are as many types of forgatherings as there are rangers. Some are held
in well-traveled forests, others in remote deserts. Some attract only specific
kit types, such as Mountain Men or Sea Rangers, while others are primarily
intended for specific races, such as elves. In general, however, most forgatherings
are open to any ranger who cares to come.
<P></P>
   Though some established forgatherings occasionally change locations and dates,
most are held in the same place and at the same time every year for the
convenience of the attendees. Any open wilderness area, reasonably isolated, can
serve as a forgathering site. Forests, mountains, and plains are preferred, as they
give the easiest access to the greatest number of rangers. Because travel can
be difficult in the winter, and summer can bring uncomfortably hot
temperatures, forgatherings are usually held in late spring or early fall. Most
forgatherings last from two to three days, but some drag on for several weeks or until the
last few diehards call it quits and head for home.
<P></P>
   Specifics about individual forgatherings are hard to come by, since rangers
tend to keep the details to themselves. Brief descriptions follow, the
pieced-together bits and pieces of information that have trickled out over the years
regarding a few of the best-attended and longest-lived meetings: feel free to add
to them and adapt them to your campaign world.

   One of the most important annual meetings is the gathering at this festival,
held during the six days following the first full moon after the autumn equinox.
Rangers of every type and specialty can be found here, though standard rangers
outnumber all the others. The site shifts every other year, alternating
between a heavily forested area and a plains region, far from any civilized
settlement. The organizers announce next year's site at the end of the current festival.
 As this is primarily a trade fair, rangers bring a wide variety of goods to
sell, and haggle with each other long into the night. Prices tend to be high,
but so does the quality.

<P></P>
   This is one of the wildest and least structured forgatherings, attracting
Mountain Men by the dozens, along with a few rowdy Giant Killers, Pathfinders, and
Forest Runners. The name derives from the person who organized the first of
these forgatherings, a rowdy Mountain Man who lost an eye in a drunken
sharpshooting contest. Held near the base of a tall mountain in mid-spring, the Glass Eye
Concourse features a weekend of physical contests, lewd jokes, and lots and
lots of cheap ale.

   In contrast to most forgatherings, the High Tide Assembly is downright sedate,
emphasizing philosophic discussion and formal lectures. This forgathering
takes place during the first high tide of spring on a quiet seashore. The Assembly
lasts for three days. Seekers, Sea Rangers, and Explorers are the primary
attendees. By tradition, the forgathering climaxes with a wild boar hunt. Following
a traditional feast, the bones of the wild boars are tossed into the sea, to
the accompaniment of triumphant cheers and whistles.

<P></P>

<P></P>
   Most often held in a central plains location, the Solstice Jamboree attracts
all types of rangers, as well as a number of bards and druids. The event lasts
for six days, beginning on the first day of the summer solstice. Lavish
banquets, featuring exotic meats and rich candies are held three times daily, and
general good fellowship is encouraged. This is an important event, for much serious
business is discussed on the side. Comrades who died the previous year are
honored on the last day of the forgathering with poetry recitations and silent
meditations.
