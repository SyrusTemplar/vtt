   Unlike many other character classes, rangers have no clear career paths.
Wizards may be taught in magic academies and clerics may be recruited by a church,
but no structured training centers exist for rangers. There are guilds for
thieves and worldwide hierarchies for druids, but rangers stubbornly resist
organizations of any kind. Since the ranger class stresses self-reliance and
independence, it's not surprising that the circumstances under which they acquire their
skills are as varied as the rangers themselves. Here are some of the most common
ways to become a ranger, along with a few kits typically associated with them.
Of course, the standard ranger might have any of these.

<P></P>
   An elderly ranger may wish to make sure that his territory will be in good
hands after his death. Rather than award conservatorship of the territory to
another ranger or a local government, he may instead decide to recruit an
apprentice. The elder not only teaches the ways of the wilderness to the young man or
woman, but also passes along his values, ensuring that his philosophy will live
on. Friends or family members of the elder make ideal candidates for apprentices,
as do orphans and human followers.

   Individuals attracted to this character class may take it upon themselves to
master the necessary skills without a formal apprenticeship. Such an individual
may be motivated by curiosity (he's fascinated by nature and longs to learn
what books can't teach), a compelling event (an army of orcs makes a surprise
attack against his village from an unpatrolled forest; he vows to guard the forest
to prevent a recurrence), or a restless urge to explore the world (he feels
smothered by the secure but boring life his parents have planned for him).
<P></P>
   A self-determined ranger often takes a circuitous route to learning his craft.
He may begin by petitioning his lord or king to allow him to accompany
military personnel on wilderness excursions, learning from observation how soldiers
survive in the field and track their enemies. He may offer to keep house or work
for a sage or hedge wizard in exchange for private lessons in botany and other
natural sciences. A few years as a neophyte in a nature-oriented church may
give him access to priestly magic. And a surreptitious partnership or adoption by
a notorious thief may teach him the knack of hiding in shadows and moving
silently.

Stalker.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
   Occasionally, a king or other official requires a ranger to explore, settle,
or administer a recently annexed territory. A replacement may be needed for a
ranger who has retired or died. If a suitable candidate isn't available, the most
suitable young man or woman may be drafted. Generous authorities may reward
the draftee's family with a monthly stipend in exchange for the cooperation of
their son or daughter. More often, however, the authorities offer no
remuneration, expecting some type of service from all citizens; recruitment as a ranger is
generally preferable to the risky life of a soldier or dull routine of a
bureaucrat.
<P></P>
   Conscripted rangers often receive first-class training, perhaps at the hands
of elder or retired rangers. Some countries have special units of border runners
or scouts, which can provide a training ground for the potential ranger. Terms
of services range from several years in most cases to a few decades in
extremely militaristic societies. Though many choose to re-enlist when their service
terms expire, most conscripted rangers eventually part company with the
established rulers and continue their careers as free agents.

   A common way for a young character to become a ranger is though circumstances
beyond his control. The following are typical. A youth who makes his way to an
uninhabited island after his ship sinks has to master the skills of a ranger in
order to survive. The lone survivor of a pioneer family slaughtered by grizzly
bears wanders for years in the wilderness, becoming a ranger in the process. A
youth captured by slavers escapes into the wilderness and eventually learns
ranger skills. He returns much later as an accomplished ranger with a mission to
destroy or drive out the band of slavers who imprisoned him.

   For purposes of their own, the gods may choose a mortal to receive the skills
of a ranger. If the gods see a need for a protector of a favored tract of land,
or desire an advocate for threatened animals, they may seek out a youth with
the prerequisite physical skills, mental agility, and moral attitude. If the
youth is open to their offer--generally, the gods won't bother with an unreceptive
candidate--he will be guided through a lengthy series of quests and training
exercises to develop the skills necessary to become a ranger. In some cases, the
gods may grant him the skills directly.

   Society has no use for some of its citizens, shunning them because of their
appearance, race, social standing, or nonconformist philosophies. Outcast youths
often find solace in the wilderness. Animals, they discover, are far less
judgmental than humans. In time, those with strong wills and a knack for survival
may become rangers through sheer tenacity.
