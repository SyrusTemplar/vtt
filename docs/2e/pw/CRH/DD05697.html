   Like fighters, rangers have the ability to build and maintain castles, forts,
and strongholds. Unlike fighters, rangers are not joined by free soldiers or
other special followers in doing so.
<P></P>
   Theoretically, any ranger can build a stronghold. In practice, most rangers
who build them are 9th level or higher, since rangers of lower level usually lack
the necessary resources, reputation, and skills. A DM may allow a lower-level
ranger to have a stronghold under exceptional circumstances; for instance, a
ranger might come into an inheritance, or a group of peasants might build a
castle in gratitude for his assistance.
<P></P>
   Some rangers acquire strongholds in cooperation with the local king or ruler.
The ranger begins the process by petitioning the ruler for permission to build
a stronghold in a particular area. If the ranger demonstrates good will and has
a reputation for trustworthiness and strong leadership, the ruler usually
grants permission. In exchange for this permission, the ranger may have to pay an
annual tax, or make himself available to serve in the ruler's military forces in
times of war. If the ranger meets his obligations, the ruler may loan royal
forces to the ranger if his territory is invaded or his stronghold besieged.
<P></P>
   More commonly, rangers prefer to build their strongholds in the unsettled
wilderness, beyond the sovereignty of any government. Though free of obligations to
a ruler, the ranger must also fend for himself in times of peril; if an army
of orcs lays claim to the ranger's territory, the ranger is on his own.
<P></P>
  Because a ranger's stronghold gains him no special followers, it tends to be
significantly smaller and less elaborate than that of a fighter of comparable
level. Though a fighter may receive money by selling products produced on his
land, taxing settlers, or charging rent, these options are rarely available to
rangers. In most cases, a ranger's stronghold generates only a modest income, if
any.
<P></P>
   Guidelines for building and maintaining strongholds are beyond the scope of
this book. For more information, you might investigate the<I> DMRG2 Castle Guide</I>, which includes details of castle construction along with a number of
standard floor plans.
<P></P>
  Though most rangers prefer castles and forts made of wood and stone, these
are by no means the only types available. Other possibilities include tree
houses (in Forest and Jungle terrain), fortified encampments (Desert), observation
platforms (Mountains), floating citadels (Swamp and Aquatic), and ice towers
(Arctic).
