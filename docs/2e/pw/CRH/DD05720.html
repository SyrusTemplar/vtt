  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp; <B>Description: </B>Though most rangers live 
   and work on land, the Sea Ranger makes his home at sea. Whether 
   sailing the ocean in a mighty galleon or riding a river's currents in 
   a handmade raft, the Sea Ranger finds the world's waters an endless 
   source of wonder. A sailor and an adventurer, he guards his watery 
   domain with vigilance, and counts many of its creatures among his 
   friends and allies.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; He has an extensive understanding of 
   weather patterns at sea and of the behavior of marine animals. He 
   specializes in combat, both on and under the water. He may be a 
   member of a formal navy, an independent operator, or a mercenary. He 
   may be charged with enforcing naval laws. Some Sea Rangers protect 
   ports or fishing territories. Others serve as escorts for trade fleets.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Aquatic Terrain:</I> For the purposes 
   of this kit, Aquatic terrain includes oceans, lakes, ponds, and 
   rivers, as well as coastlines, beaches, and small islands.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Requirements:</B> Because a Sea Ranger 
   must master a wide range of knowledge he requires a minimum 
   Intelligence score of 12. Because few elves and half-elves have the 
   temperament for the seaman's life, virtually all Sea Rangers are 
   human (though being human isn't a strict requirement).</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Primary Terrain:</B> <I>Required:</I> Aquatic.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Role:</B> Sea Rangers have reputations 
   as dedicated, sharp-minded professionals. As such, they are often 
   sought by adventuring parties in need of their special skills, 
   particularly when an adventure takes them to aquatic environments or 
   they expect to face opponents of oceanic origin. Though Sea Rangers 
   generally prefer to remain at sea, they travel on land as necessary 
   to achieve the goals of their party. As many of a Sea Ranger's 
   followers are waterbound, he obviously has less access to them when 
   adventuring on land, a handicap he endures graciously but without enthusiasm.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The environment has a profound effect on 
   a Sea Ranger's attitude. On land, his party companions will find him 
   hesitant and uncertain, following orders without comment and 
   reluctant to offer advice. In an aquatic setting, however, he becomes 
   a different person--confident, assertive, and commanding. Only the 
   most stubborn or foolish parties will decline a leadership role to a 
   Sea Ranger in watery terrain.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Fisher, 
   Navigator, Sailor, Shipwright, Trader/Barterer, Weaver.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Recommended:</I> 
   Dagger, knife, harpoon, sword (any), pole arm (any), trident;<I> Optional:</I> 
   Belaying pin, cutlass, gaff/hook.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp; <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonus:</I> 
   Boating* or Seamanship; Swimming. <I>Recommended:</I> Cartography*, 
   Direction Sense, Distance Sense*, Endurance, Fishing, Navigation, 
   Riding (Sea-based)*, Rope Use. <I>Barred: </I>Agriculture, 
   Blacksmithing, Chari-</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">oteering, Falconry*, Mining, Mountaineering, Riding 
   (Land-based), Spelunking*, Stonemasonry.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> Because heavy 
   armor interferes with swimming and makes moving around a ship 
   uncomfortable, most Sea Rangers wear armor with an AC of 8 or less.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Species Enemy:</B> Any aquatic 
   creature is eligible as a species enemy.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Followers:</B> The primary terrain of 
   all animal followers must be Aquatic. Any full elf follower is 80% 
   likely to be an aquatic elf.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp; <B>Special Benefits:</B></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Sea Tracking:</I> Because of his 
   knowledge of prevailing winds, currents, and other general aquatic 
   conditions, the Sea Ranger can effectively track waterborne craft and 
   aquatic creatures. This is not so much a reading of physical signs as 
   an instinctive deduction of the probable course and destination of 
   the quarry. For purposes of general play, the Sea Ranger uses the 
   normal Tracking proficiency check rules.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Land Scent:</I> When at sea, the Sea 
   Ranger can smell the presence of land (including islands) within 50 
   miles. Further, if the Sea Ranger has ever been to that land before, 
   he has a 10% chance per level of identifying it precisely.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Sea Legs:</I> The Sea Ranger has a 
   fine sense of balance, which comes into play when he must fight on a 
   narrow beam (such as a yardarm or boarding plank) or a pitching deck. 
   Not only is he sure-footed under such conditions (avoiding any attack 
   penalties for them), but any saving throws or Dexterity checks made 
   to maintain his balance are made at a +2 bonus.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Aquatic Combat:</I> A Sea Ranger 
   suffers no penalties to his attack rolls when in water; otherwise he 
   follows the standard rules for underwater combat given in Chapter 9 
   of the <I>DUNGEON MASTER Guide.</I></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Parliament of Fishes:</I> When a Sea 
   Ranger reaches 12th level, he may attempt to call a parliament of 
   fishes. He may use this ability once per week. If successful, the Sea 
   Ranger can demand a service of the school. Typical services include 
   the location or recovery of small items, the provision of edible 
   water plants, information about local monsters or conditions, and 
   perhaps transport across a small body of water if the parliament 
   members are large enough. Once a month this can be the equivalent of 
   a <I>commune with nature</I> spell.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; To call a <I>parliament of fishes</I>, 
   the Sea Ranger locates a pond, lake, or any other body of water 
   containing aquatic life. Sometime between sunset and dawn, he kneels 
   beside the body of water and concentrates for a full turn. An attack 
   or interruption in any other way during this time will break his 
   concentration, and he can't attempt to call a<I> parliament of fishes</I> 
   until the following week.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, at the end of 10 rounds, 
   10-100 (10d10) fish or other aquatic creatures (as appropriate to the 
   body of water) surface and stare expectantly at the Sea Ranger. The 
   Sea Ranger must then toss an offering into the water; the gift may be 
   food, a coin, or any other object of the ranger's choice.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The DM then rolls 1d10 and consults Table 
   50. If the offer was reasonably generous, increase the result by +1. 
   If the offering was exceptionally valuable, increase the result by 
   +2. If the offering was meager (a copper piece or a chunk of bread), 
   decrease the result by -1. If the offering was essentially worthless 
   (a bone or a chunk of rock), decrease the result by -2. The result 
   can't be decreased below 1 or raised above 10.</FONT></P>
