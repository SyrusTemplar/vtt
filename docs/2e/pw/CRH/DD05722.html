  <BODY >
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Stalker</B></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Description:</B> At first glance, this 
   soft-spoken, rather nondescript character seems hopelessly out of 
   place in an adventuring party, looking instead like an town dweller 
   who's wandered into the wilderness by mistake. But the drab demeanor 
   is only a facade, concealing keen senses, a shrewd mind, and 
   remarkable insight. Only his closest friends realize the extent of 
   his expertise in intelligence-gathering. And that's just the way he 
   likes it.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Stalkers serve as spies, informants, and 
   interrogators. Unlike other rangers, Stalkers are comfortable in both 
   wilderness and urban settings. A Stalker may covertly observe a 
   bandit camp to inventory their supplies and hostages, or eavesdrop in 
   the corridors of an evil wizard's castle. A few innocuous questions 
   enable him to distinguish friend from foe, and fact from fiction. His 
   mastery of stealth makes him a deadly opponent.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Requirements:</B> A Stalker must have 
   a minimum Intelligence score of 14. Stalkers must be human.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Primary Terrain:</B> Any; in addition, 
   the Stalker's primary terrain can be Urban (see Special Benefits).</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Role:</B> Stalkers tend to be 
   introspective and reflective, valuing intellect over physical 
   prowess. They avoid drawing attention to themselves, seldom speaking 
   unless directly addressed, then responding succinctly and without 
   elaboration. They avoid small talk and socializing, instead 
   preferring the company of a good book or an hour spent examining an 
   unusual footprint. Stalkers tend to suppress their emotions so their 
   decisions aren't colored by what they consider to be irrelevancies.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Though most people respect Stalkers, they 
   are also wary of them. The Stalker's stealthiness and secrecy make 
   many people uneasy, as these are traits usually associated with 
   thieves and sneaks. But Stalkers value honor as much as any ranger, 
   and nobles rarely hesitate to hire one in times of crisis. A hired 
   Stalker can be trusted to focus on the job at hand, complete it 
   efficiently, make his report, then go his own way without comment.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Adventuring parties often hire Stalkers 
   on retainer, though occasionally, a Stalker will join a party with no 
   assurance of monetary reward if the adventure presents an intriguing 
   challenge. Stalkers rarely are party leaders, though they express 
   their opinions freely when invited to do so. In combat, most Stalkers 
   are brave but cautious, waiting for tactical opportunities to present 
   themselves rather than charging into the fray. They prefer to 
   surprise their opponents, striking silently and quickly.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Any.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> Stalkers 
   become proficient only with weapons they can easily conceal. Their 
   weapon proficiencies are limited to blowgun, dagger, dart, knife, 
   short sword, staff, and sling. <I>Optional:</I> garrote, rapier 
   (walking stick), stiletto.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonus:</I> 
   Alertness*, Camouflage*. <I>Recommended:</I> Blind-fighting, 
   Etiquette, Modern Languages, Persuasion*, Signaling*, Trail Marking*, 
   Trail Signs*.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Armor/Equipment: </B>A Stalker prefers 
   to carry no more gear than he can comfortably strap to his back. He 
   wears well-made but unpretentious clothing, similar to that of a 
   laborer or peasant, that allows him to blend in with crowds. Though 
   he can wear any type of armor (see Special Benefits) he favors 
   leather. Stalkers almost never carry shields, finding them awkward 
   and restrictive.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning of his career, a Stalker 
   receives a free &quot;terrain suit&quot; (see Chapter 7). The terrain 
   suit corresponds to his primary terrain (night black for Urban).</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Species Enemy: Any. Optionally, the 
   Stalker can declare a specific thieves' guild or assassin's guild as 
   his enemy.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Followers:</B> Because a Stalker 
   prefers to work unhampered, his followers are limited in number, 
   species, and size. Though he receives a career total of 2d6 followers 
   like other rangers, a Stalker has only one follower at a time. A new 
   follower won't appear until the Stalker's current follower dies or is 
   dismissed. A Stalker won't acquire a new follower even if he releases 
   his current follower or arranges for its care elsewhere; he must 
   sever all ties with the old follower before another will arrive.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A Stalker never accepts human or 
   demihuman followers. Nor will he accept followers whose intelligence 
   compares favorably with that of humans, such as pixies or aarakocra, 
   as he fears such beings are undependable and may cause unnecessary 
   distractions. Because he wishes to minimize the chances of attracting 
   attention, all animal followers must be less than four feet tall 
   (size &quot;S&quot; or &quot;T&quot;).</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Special Benefits:</B></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Tracking:</I> A Stalker has normal 
   ranger tracking abilities in outdoor land settings. In addition, he 
   has full (not half) tracking capabilities in urban settings.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Stealth Abilities:</I></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> A Stalker has a +10% 
   bonus to his base chance to hide in shadows/hide in natural 
   surroundings and a +10% bonus to his chances to move silently.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> A Stalker has the 
   full (not half) chance for success when attempting to hide in shadows 
   or move silently in urban settings or in non-natural constructions 
   such as crypts or dungeons.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> Stalkers can hide in 
   shadows and move silently when wearing armor of AC 6 or less (see 
   Table 13: Optional Armor in Chapter 1).</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> When a Stalker 
   successfully uses his move silently ability to sneak up on an 
   opponent to surprise him, the opponent suffers a -3 penalty to his 
   surprise roll. The Stalker must be 90' or more from party members 
   without similar silent movement abilities.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Interrogation:</I> When interrogating 
   an NPC for any reason, a Stalker can acquire special knowledge about 
   the NPC in one (but not both) of the following ways:</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> By making a 
   successful Intelligence check (use half the Intelligence score, 
   rounded up), the Stalker can determine the general alignment of the 
   NPC. If successful, the Stalker learns the good-evil component of the 
   NPC's alignment (good, neutral, or evil).</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> The Stalker can 
   ascertain the NPC's honesty. The DM secretly makes an Intelligence 
   check for the Stalker. If the check fails, the DM tells the Stalker 
   nothing about the honesty of the NPC. The Stalker must make up his 
   own mind about the NPC's reliability based on the NPC's responses.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If the check succeeds and the NPC is 
   being honest with the Stalker, the DM tells the Stalker that the NPC 
   is telling the truth to the best of his knowledge. A successful check 
   in no way compels the NPC to reveal any information to the Stalker. 
   The NPC may refuse to cooperate, but the Stalker is assured of the 
   truthfulness of anything the NPC decides to share (note that the NPC 
   may still pass along unreliable information that he believes to be true).</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If the check succeeds, and the NPC is 
   being dishonest with the Stalker, the DM tells the Stalker that the 
   NPC may be lying. It's up to the Stalker to separate the truth from 
   the lies; a successful check only tells him that he shouldn't take 
   everything the NPC says at face value.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Photographic Memory:</I> When a 
   Stalker reaches 10th level, he acquires a limited photographic 
   memory, enabling him to recall details about anything he's seen or 
   heard since achieving 10th level. He can recall a fragment of a 
   conversation, conjure up a mental image of a place he's visited, or 
   remember words on a printed page. To use this ability, the DM 
   secretly makes an Intelligence check for the Stalker, with a -2 
   penalty. If the roll fails, the memory is too vague to be of any use 
   to the Stalker. If the roll succeeds, the DM tells the Stalker what 
   he wishes to remember. If the roll is a natural 20, the DM gives the 
   Stalker intentionally misleading information about whatever he's 
   trying to remember (a room, for instance, is incorrectly recalled as 
   having a locked window or mysterious claw marks on the walls). 
   Because of the mental stress involved, this ability can be used only 
   once per day.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Special Hindrances:</B> Neither 
   lawbreakers nor outlaws appreciate snoops. Typically, the harshest 
   possible penalties are reserved for captured Stalkers. Should a band 
   of orcs or goblins realize that a Stalker is in their midst, they're 
   likely to chase him down and beat him mercilessly. A Stalker caught 
   lurking in private residence will probably be prosecuted to the 
   fullest extent of the law. An otherwise friendly NPC may be less 
   likely to cooperate with the party if he recognizes one of the 
   members as a Stalker.</FONT></P>
