<P></P>
   <B>Description:</B> A wanderer, the Beastmaster has a natural affinity for animals; in fact, he
has a limited form of telepathic communication with them. This is often the
result of a magical bond with the Animal Kingdom, formed either at the time of his
birth or upon reaching young adulthood. Unlike other adventurers, the
Beastmaster does not command, train, or control his animal companions, rather they are
his friends and comrades-in-arms. Misunderstood and feared by nobles and common
folk alike for his unnatural abilities with animals, the Beastmaster seldom
stays in one place for long, nor is he comfortable in civilized lands.
<P></P>
   <B>Requirements:</B> Standard.
<P></P>
   <B>Primary Terrain:</B> Any outdoor land.
<P></P>
   <B>Role: </B>Beastmasters tend to walk alone, accompanied only by the fierce natural beasts
that are their friends and allies. Traveling the fringes of settled lands, the
Beastmaster has small use for the trappings of civilization, but even less for
the minions of evil, particularly those of a magical or priestly nature. Thus,
a Beastmaster will often find himself aiding the oppressed or enslaved, and
pitted against the cruelties of evil priests or wizards and their allies.
<P></P>
   <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Hunter, Fisher.
<P></P>
   <B>Weapon Proficiencies: </B>A Beastmaster is initially limited to weapons that he can make himself: axe
(any), club, dagger, dart, javelin, knife, quarterstaff, sling, or spear.
<P></P>
   <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonus:</I> None, but see Special Benefits.<I> Recommended:</I> Agriculture, Bowyer/Fletcher, Endurance, Hunting, Leather working, Running,
Swimming, Weather Sense. Optional: See Weaponsmithing (Crude) in the Mountain
Man section).
<P></P>
   <I>Barred:</I> Armorer, Etiquette, Heraldry, Navigation, Weaponsmithing.
<P></P>
   <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> The Beastmaster starts only with leather armor and weapons he has made.
<P></P>
   <B>Species Enemy:</B> Standard.
<P></P>
   <B>Followers:</B> None, but see Special Benefits.
<P></P>
   <B>Special Benefits:</B>
<P></P>
   <I>Stealth:</I> The Beastmaster has a +5% chance to hide in natural surroundings.
<P></P>
  <I> Animal Henchmen:</I> Although a Beastmaster receives no special followers at high level, he can
acquire normal or giant animals as henchmen. He may acquire them at any level,
and their number depends on his Charisma. If these animals are slain or driven
away, they can be replaced by new animals without penalty (though this may take
some time).
<P></P>
   <I>Animal Telepathy:</I> The Beastmaster can establish telepathic communication with any normal or
giant animal within 30', if he does nothing else in the round. The animal must
have a minimum Intelligence of 1. This has the following benefits:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The Beastmaster can communicate to the creature that he desires its
friendship. If the offer is sincere (and the animal will be able to sense if it isn't),
the creature can be calmed and will not attack or flee unless it is attacked.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The Beastmaster can recruit an animal he has befriended as a henchman if he is
not at his limit and if the creature fails a saving throw vs. rods. The saving
throw is penalized by -1 for every three levels of experience the Beastmaster
has earned. At the DM's option, animals may present themselves for recruitment
in the same way that followers appear to other rangers.
<P></P>
   <I>Animal Bonding:</I> The Beastmaster forms a mental bond with any animal he recruits as a
henchman. There is no distance limit, but this ability does not cross planar
boundaries. This bond has the following effects:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> The Beastmaster can communicate directly with any animal henchman to which he
has a bond. This gives him the ability to directly explain tricks or tasks he
wishes the animal to attempt, or to communicate needs and desires. Conversely,
the animal can also communicate its needs and desires to him.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> He can see through the eyes of the animal by concentrating on the mental link.
He can see through the eyes of one creature in a round (himself included).
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> He has the animal lore proficiency with respect to the bonded animal.
Furthermore, if he is mentally linked to the animal, success with the proficiency is
automatic.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Every time the Beastmaster gains a level, all of his current animal henchmen
gain an additional hit point.
<P></P>
   <I>Animal Horde:</I> At 9th level, the Beastmaster can summon a horde of wild animals to fight for
him. They must come from a land that he controls, and it takes one week to
gather them.
<P></P>
   They can be brought together only for some great purpose that can be explained
simply. Up to 100 Hit Dice of animals per level of the Beastmaster will come.
For every 10 animals, there will be a pack leader with one additional Hit Die
and maximum hit points. The horde will stay together for one week for each level
of the Beastmaster. There is no record of a Beastmaster summoning more than
one horde in a year.
<P></P>

<P></P>
   <I>Optional Rule:</I> The Beastmaster can split his experience award, giving up to half of his
earned experience to any or all of his animal henchmen that played a role in the
adventure. Such henchmen advance on the Fighter Experience Table, receiving +1 to
attack rolls and +3 hit points for every level gained.
<P></P>

<P></P>
  <B> Special Hindrances:
<P></P>
</B>   <I>Empathic Shock:</I> The Beastmaster feels pain when one of his henchmen is wounded, suffering a
-2 penalty to all rolls in the next round. If he is mentally linked with a
henchman when it is killed, he suffers a -2 penalty to all rolls for the next 24
hours.
<P></P>
   <I>Unruly Allies:</I> The Beastmaster's animal henchmen are free to come, go, or act as they will.
Any attempt to arbitrarily restrict or regulate their freedom, or habitually
ignoring their needs and desires, will result in resentment, sulkiness, and
possible abandonment.
<P></P>
   <I>Outcast: </I>The Beastmaster suffers a -1 penalty to reaction rolls by common NPCs, and a
-2 when dealing with a civilized aristocracy. Further, his maximum effective
Charisma when dealing with his own race is 15.
<P></P>
   <I>Limited Funds:</I> The Beastmaster starts with 1d4 - 10 gp.
<P></P>
   <I>No Fortress:</I> At no time will the Beastmaster build a fortress. At 9th level, he may
establish himself as the protector of an area of land equivalent to a barony.
