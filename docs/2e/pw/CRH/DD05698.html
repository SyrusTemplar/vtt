 Perhaps the ranger's most interesting ability is the chance to attract unusual
followers. Unlike fighters and other character classes that acquire followers,
the ranger's followers include animals and magical creatures as well as humans
and demihumans. In fact, it's possible that all of a ranger's followers may be
animals, which can result in unexpected benefits (strangers aren't as likely
to mess with a ranger accompanied by a wolf pack) as well as unforeseen
complications (ever try getting a room at an inn with a bear trotting behind you?).
<P></P>
   Humans and demihumans (and magical creatures) are drawn to a ranger because of
his sterling reputation. They serve as followers out of loyalty and respect,
remaining true to the ranger so long as he treats them decently. In this way,
such followers are different from normal hirelings and mercenaries who serve for
pay.
<P></P>
   The motivations of animal followers are less obvious. Animals have no
conception of what constitutes a reputation, sterling or otherwise. Instead, animals
bond to rangers by instinct. The nature of this bond lies somewhere between the
relationship of an infant animal and its parent (picture a baby duck contentedly
swimming behind its mother), and a master and his pet (think of a dog's
affection for the person who provides him with companionship). If the ranger honors
the bond, the follower will often remain loyal for its entire life.
<P></P>
   It's important to keep in mind that this bond has no magical basis. The
follower stays with a ranger of its own volition, not from some supernatural
compulsion, and may leave if conditions become intolerable. Likewise, a ranger doesn't
control the actions of his followers, though he may instruct human followers to
carry out specific functions, and train animal followers to perform various
tricks and tasks.
