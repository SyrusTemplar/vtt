   Humans and demihumans become followers for different reasons than animals.
Drawn to a ranger's reputation for honor and integrity, humans and demihumans
serve as followers out of respect, admiration, and hero-worship. They remain loyal
so long as their basic needs are met, and the ranger doesn't betray their trust.
<P></P>
   Trainability doesn't apply to human and demihuman followers. Instead, they
will perform any duties or functions within reason. Typically, such followers
serve as soldiers, but they may also work as guards, servants, or personal aides.
<P></P>
   Human and demihuman followers accompany the ranger as long as their basic
needs are met and their are fairly treated. Some may serve with the understanding
that the ranger will teach them the ways of the wilderness. It's up to the
ranger to determine the needs and expectations of each new follower when he arrives.
<P></P>
   A ranger's human and demihuman followers aren't confined to a stronghold. They
may accompany him on his travels or undertake independent missions. In other
respects, a ranger's followers adhere to the guidelines given in Chapter 12 of
the<I> Player's Handbook</I>. The DM should prepare a character sheet with all relevant statistics for
each new follower. The DM, not the player, controls the actions of the follower.
<P></P>
   <B>Restrictions.</B> In general, human and demihuman followers should be of 1st to 4th level when
they appear; a 15th-level fighter has better things to do than tag along after
a 10th-level ranger. Additionally, the follower should be of good alignment;
except in rare cases, rangers won't tolerate neutral or evil followers.
<P></P>
   <B>Followers can be of either sex.</B> The age of the follower is also unimportant, although because of their low
levels, most followers will be relatively young.
<P></P>
   <B>Personalities.</B> Impressionable youths, curious scholars, impulsive vagabonds, and orphaned
wanderers all make good followers. Interesting quirks or personal problems make
followers more fun for the players, and also provide springboards for
adventures. Chapter 12 of the <I>DUNGEON MASTER Guide</I> offers suggestions for creating NPC personalities, which are also suitable
for followers.
<P></P>
   <B>Abandonment.</B> Just as he may do with animal followers, the ranger may dismiss or release
his human and demihuman followers. Released followers may rejoin the ranger at a
later time. Human and demihuman rangers who are dismissed or otherwise lost
can't be replaced.
<P></P>
   Human and demihuman followers may also abandon their rangers. Situations that
may trigger abandonment include reckless endangerment, continual verbal abuse,
or inattention to the follower's needs. If the ranger commits an act of
cowardice or otherwise violates his code of honor, a follower may become disillusioned
and abandon the ranger in disgust. The DM might make morale checks to
determine if a follower stays or goes, he may resolve the situation by role-playing
(the follower requests an explanation for the ranger's cowardly behavior; the
follower stays if the ranger offers a reasonable justification), or in extreme
cases, he may have the follower simply disappear without explanation.
