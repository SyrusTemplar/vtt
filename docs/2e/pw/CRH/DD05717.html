  <TITLE>Justifier (Comp. Ranger's Handbook)</TITLE>
 </HEAD>
  <BODY >
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Justifier</B></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Description:</B> Some expeditions are 
   so demanding and some foes so dangerous that they require the 
   attention of a highly trained specialist whose combat skills far 
   exceed those of the typical ranger. Enter the Justifier, a master 
   tactician whose military instincts, fighting versatility, and steely 
   nerves places him in the first rank of elite warriors.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the Justifier specializes in 
   neutralizing monsters, his skills qualify him for a wide range of 
   adventures. He may organize guerilla forces and lead them into 
   hostile territories. He may stage reconnaissance operations to gather 
   information concerning enemy strength and logistics. He may execute 
   strikes against monster lairs, rescue hostages, or eliminate tribal 
   leaders or spell casters. For a determined Justifier, no job is too 
   difficult, no enemy too formidable.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Requirements: </B>Justifiers must have 
   minimum scores of 14 in Strength and Dexterity. They must be human 
   and of lawful good alignment.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Primary Terrain:</B> Any.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Role:</B> Justifiers boast extensive 
   training in weapon use, scouting, warding, and outdoor survival. Some 
   learn these skills in a regular standing military, others are trained 
   by military orders. A few highly motivated individuals are 
   self-taught. Justifiers are in high demand by rulers as army 
   officers, as well as by private individuals who use them as 
   bodyguards. Many hire themselves out as mercenaries or volunteer for 
   causes that further their own ideals.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; As Justifiers thrive on action, most are 
   eager to join adventuring parties. On occasion, freelance Justifiers 
   may demand a retainer from a party or a guaranteed percentage of any 
   treasure found. But more often than not, a freelance Justifier will 
   join a party without remuneration if their task is just and promises 
   him the chance to exercise his combat skills.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A Justifier's companions will find him 
   disciplined, focused, and unyielding in his determination to 
   accomplish his objectives. He socializes little, preferring instead 
   to keep his body strong with punishing exercise and his mind sharp 
   with quiet meditation. A natural leader in combat situations, he 
   fights with grim intensity and fearless perseverance.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Secondary Skills:</B> Armorer, 
   Bowyer/Fletcher, Forester, Hunter, Trapper/Furrier, Weaponsmith.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B><I> Recommended:</I> 
   Bow (any), crossbow (any), dagger, sling, spear, sword (any). See 
   Special Bonuses.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> <I>Bonus:</I> 
   Survival; in addition to having this proficiency in his primary 
   terrain, the Justifier receives the proficiency in an extra terrain 
   of his choice (see also, Special Hindrances).<I> Recommended: </I>Alertness*,
    Blind-fighting, Bowyer/Fletcher, Camouflage*, Endurance, Falconry*, 
   Hunting, Mountaineering, Navigation, Riding (Land-based), Rope Use, 
   Running, Set Snares, Swimming, Weaponsmithing.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Armor/Equipment:</B> A Justifier has 
   no special armor or equipment requirements. Though most Justifiers 
   prefer light armor, such as leather, they can wear any type of armor 
   and still hide in shadows and move silently. Refer to Table 13: 
   Optional Armor Adjustments in Chapter 1 for adjustments to success chances.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Species Enemy:</B> Any. A Justifier is 
   more respected by his enemies than other rangers, and therefore 
   suffers only a -2 penalty on encounter reactions with his species 
   enemy, and no penalty if there is a formal truce.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Followers: </B>Any.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Special Benefits:</B></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Weapon Specialization:</I> Because of 
   his extensive combat training, the Justifier must use some of his 
   initial proficiency slots to take one weapon specialization (see 
   Chapter 5 of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>). The weapon of 
   specialization is taken from the list of recommended weapons.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Stealth: </I>The Justifier receives a 
   +5% bonus to his chance of hiding in natural surroundings and to his 
   chance of moving silently.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Tactical Advantage:</I> This ability 
   allows the Justifier and his companions to gain a combat advantage by 
   studying the enemy and exploiting their weaknesses. The Justifier 
   must spend at least a full, uninterrupted turn secretly observing an 
   enemy or group of enemies prior to making an attack. At the end of 
   this period, the Justifier makes a Wisdom check. If successful, the 
   Justifier has correctly assessed the enemy's weaknesses and is able 
   to maximize the timing of an attack. The Justifier and his party 
   automatically surprise the enemy and gain the initiative for the 
   first round. A Justifier can attempt to gain a tactical advantage 
   only once in a particular encounter.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Unarmed Combat Expertise:</I> When 
   fighting with his bare hands, the Justifier inflicts 1-4 points of 
   damage on a successful attack roll. If the Justifier throws an 
   unmodified 20 on his attack roll, the victim suffers 1-4 points of 
   damage and must also make a saving throw vs. paralyzation. If the 
   throw fails, the victim is stunned for 1-6 rounds.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Coordinated Attack:</I> The Justifier 
   can use this ability, in conjunction with a trained animal follower, 
   to inflict maximum damage on an opponent. The animal follower must 
   have been trained to attack on command (see the Training Followers 
   rules in Chapter 3).</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; To attempt a coordinated attack, the 
   Justifier and the animal both make a single attack on the same enemy 
   in the same round (even if one or both are normally allowed multiple 
   attacks; the animal will use its most damaging attack). If either 
   roll misses, then that attacker automatically loses initiative in the 
   next round. If both rolls hit, each attack causes twice the normal 
   amount of damage. A coordinated attack involves only one follower. A 
   coordinated attack may be attempted at any time during a combat, but 
   only once against any particular opponent during an encounter.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Special Hindrances:</B></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Limited Proficiencies:</I> The 
   Justifier's mastery of weapons and combat comes at the expense of 
   learning other skills. For this reason, he receives only one 
   nonweapon proficiency slot at 1st level (in addition to his Survival 
   bonus). He acquires additional proficiency slots at the normal rate.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Limited Spell Use:</I> Because the 
   Justifier devotes less time to the study of magic than to the 
   military arts, he has less access to spells than other rangers. The 
   Justifier doesn't acquire spells until he reaches 10th level. Table 
   46 shows the Justifier's spell progression.</FONT></P>
