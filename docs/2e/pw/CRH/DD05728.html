    The main multi-class option open for a ranger is the half-elf cleric/ranger.
The half-elf advances in both classes simultaneously, up to 16th level ranger
and 14th level cleric. All the usual rules for multi-class characters as given in
the <I>Player's Handbook</I> should be followed.

<B>Optional Rule: The Ranger-Druid
<P></P>
</B>   Generally, a ranger/druid combination is not possible, due to the conflicting
alignments of the classes. However, campaign conditions may allow their
creation, should the players and DM decide that they wish to experiment with them.
<P></P>
   First, there must be a nature deity of good alignment whose specialty priests
are druidic. Second, the priesthood must have an allied group of rangers. Given
these conditions, a half-elf ranger/druid character may be possible.
<P></P>
   Such a character is still bound by racial level limits, in this case 16th
level ranger and 9th level druid. Even if the optional level advancement for
exceptional ability scores is used, such a character is unlikely to become a 12th
level druid (a level for which the character must fight). At the very least, the
character will have formidable enemies among conservative members of the
priestly hierarchy, and is likely to become the target of subtle plots. Also, such a
character would be under constant pressure from divided loyalties, as his chosen
professions will tend to pull him in different directions.
