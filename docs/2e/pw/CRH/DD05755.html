<P></P>
   Low-level clerics may become followers of rangers for many of the same reasons
as druids. Not all clerics make suitable followers. The cleric must be of good
alignment and should be several experience levels lower than the ranger. Since
most rangers are human or half-elven, clerics of these races are the most
likely to sign on, though a ranger will rarely reject a follower solely on account
of race. Gender considerations usually aren't important, but a cleric with a
strict upbringing may hesitate to follow a ranger of the opposite sex.
<P></P>
   The faith of a clerical follower should be compatible with that of the ranger.
This doesn't mean that the faiths must be identical--an inquisitive cleric
might want to follow a ranger solely to study the nuances of an unusual
religion--but the goals of the faiths can't be diametrically opposed. For instance, if
the cleric believes that anyone who prays to inanimate objects is a heathen, he
won't follow a ranger who worships mountains.
<P></P>
   A cleric serves the ranger in the same way as other followers--assisting him
in combat, performing routine chores, and offering advice. In turn, the ranger
benefits from the cleric's priestly skills and loyalty. The cleric may be able
to assist with some of the ranger's religious requirements; for example, the
cleric might handle the blessing of new followers, or come up with the daily
offering of food or treasure. If they share the same faith, the cleric may teach the
ranger new ways to worship, as well as engaging him in enlightening
conversations concerning all things spiritual.
<P></P>
  As with all followers, a cleric will remain in the company of a ranger as
long as the relationship is mutually beneficial. When the cleric reaches the end
of his penance or learns what he wants to know, he may express his desire to
leave. A gracious ranger will grant this request, either dismissing or releasing
the cleric at the earliest opportunity. Should the cleric prove to be a
nuisance--or worse, if the ranger finds the cleric's religious practices to be
unacceptable--the latter may be dismissed without explanation.
<P></P>
   Conversely, a ranger may find it advantageous to serve as a temporary follower
of a cleric. He may seek out a cleric because an obligation requires him to
spend a period of time working for a church, or because he wishes to learn more
about that religion in a structured setting. Alternately, a ranger may volunteer
to protect a clerical stronghold, or his deity may have commanded him to
become a follower to show his dedication. Regardless of his motivation, a ranger
usually serves as a follower for a limited period of time, seldom exceeding a few
months. He typically begins his term of service early in his career, usually
before reaching 3rd level. When his term ends, however, he may continue an
informal relationship with that particular church for a much longer period.
<P></P>
   Clerics of 8th level or higher who establish large places of worship may
accept ranger followers. Some clerics may have gender, racial, or kit preferences
for their followers, but usually they'll accept any ranger whose faith is
compatible with their own and who demonstrates a sincere commitment to serve. Once
accepted, the ranger is expected to obey his clerical superiors and adhere to
their traditions. The ranger may be required, for instance, to pay a weekly
offering for the upkeep of the fortification, take a vow of chastity, or wear a
distinctive cloak or other garment. He may also be expected to perform any number of
special duties. Typical duties might include:

damage, sweeping floors, polishing metalwork, cleaning latrines, and so on.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Constructing a wilderness shrine or temple. Usually, this is performed under
the supervision of a superior. The ranger handles most of the manual labor.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Recopying faded sacred texts on fresh parchments. Often the language will be
unfamiliar to the ranger, as some clerics believe that copying foreign script
enhances the disciplinary benefits of the practice.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Supervising the fortification's herd animals. This includes feeding, watering,
administering to sick animals, and cleaning barns and stables.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Tending the church's gardens and harvesting the crops.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> Protecting the stronghold against monsters and enemy armies.
<P></P>
   A ranger can expect to be disciplined if he refuses to obey his superiors or
becomes derelict in his duties. For minor infractions, he may be confined to his
quarters or given additional chores. Major infractions may result in beatings
or even a banishment from the fortification. In extreme cases, the ranger's
superiors may be able to exert their influence to permanently separate the ranger
from their religion, causing him to lose all associated privileges and benefits.
<P></P>
   In the context of a game, a ranger's term as a clerical follower may take
place between adventures, or it may be incorporated into a campaign, possibly as a
springboard for an expedition involving the entire party (the ranger must
complete a quest for his cleric, and recruits other companions to help him).
<P></P>
   A ranger's term as a clerical follower may have a variety of consequences, for
weal or woe. On the good side, he may make some powerful new contacts and
learn some new skills. He may even acquire a new follower or two of his own (a
low-level cleric or fighter decides to accompany the ranger when he leaves). On the
other hand, the ranger may become burdened with new duties to perform (in
exchange for his training, his clerical superiors now expect him to offer extra
donations every month in their honor). At any time, he may be unexpectedly
summoned to the clerical stronghold to help train novices or defend against attackers.
