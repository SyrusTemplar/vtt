 Let's begin our examination of the ranger with a look at the numbers--the
statistics, adjustments, and level progressions that define the ranger class. This
is the raw data common to all rangers, regardless of their backgrounds or
personalities.
<P></P>
  This chapter compiles the basic information in the <I>Player's Handbook</I> regarding the ranger class, as well as the relevant material from the warrior
section. In addition, some concepts, such as armor adjustments and level
improvements, are clarified and expanded. A new concept, <I>primary terrain</I>, is also introduced.
<P></P>
  In later chapters, we'll be discussing the ranger's special abilities in
more detail, along with role-playing tips and options for refining his
personality. But for now, we'll concentrate on the fundamentals, beginning with the most
basic consideration of all--the ranger's class requirements.
