  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="4"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Miscellaneous Equipment</B></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Breathing Tube.</B> This simple device 
   helps a character function underwater. A breathing tube made of a 
   hollow reed, about a foot long, strengthened with wax and treated 
   with waterproofing oil. The user places the tube in his mouth, then 
   submerges himself with the end of the tube protruding from the water. 
   The tube enables the submerged user to breathe indefinitely.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Camouflage Paint Kit.</B> This compact leather case 
   contains several cakes of greasepaint (in various shades of brown, 
   green, yellow, and black), applicator brushes, a jar of paint removal 
   cream, and a small mirror. Characters apply the paint to areas of 
   exposed flesh to help them blend in with their surroundings. A kit 
   contains 12 uses.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; By itself, camouflage paint doesn't give 
   a character any particular advantage. However, when used with a 
   terrain suit (described above), it boosts the character's success 
   chances by +1. The camouflage proficiency is required to apply the 
   camouflage paint well; those without this proficiency have <I>half</I> 
   the usual chance of success. A character using camouflage paint and a 
   terrain suit gains a +2 bonus to his camouflage check.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Chain Leash.</B> Made of chain links with a leather 
   muzzle, this leash can be adjusted to fit any animal ranging in size 
   from a small dog to a wolf. The length of the leash varies from 6-12 
   feet long. When using a properly-fitted chain leash on an animal, a 
   character receives a +1 bonus to his animal training proficiency 
   checks. Chain leashes are available in other sizes and lengths to fit 
   larger and smaller animals.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Falconry Gauntlet.</B> Also called a perch glove, 
   this is a heavy arm-length glove of thick leather upon which a falcon 
   or hawk can perch.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Falcon Training Equipment.</B> This equipment makes 
   falcon training more efficient. A character using the falconry 
   proficiency without this equipment suffers a -2 penalty to training 
   proficiency checks. One set is required for each falcon.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">Each set consists of <I>jesses</I> (leather bands with 
   rings, attached to the falcon's legs), <I>talon guards</I> (metal 
   coverings for the bird-s claws to prevent it from harming the owner 
   during training), a <I>creance</I> (a slender leather leash attached 
   to the jesses, held by the user or secured to the perch glove), and a <I>hood</I> 
   (a leather covering fitting over the falcon-s head that restricts 
   vision; the hood forces the falcon to rely on its senses of hearing, 
   touch, and taste). Customized or richly appointed equipment, such as 
   an embroidered hood or golden jesses, is also available, usually at 
   double or triple the normal price.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Fishing Tackle.</B> This meticulously crafted set 
   of polished wooden lures, colorful flies made of feathers and catgut 
   cord, bone hooks, and cork bobbers can be quite useful in the hands 
   of a skilled fisherman. If used by a character with the fishing 
   proficiency, the proficiency checks are modified by +1.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Healing Kit.</B> This is a waterproofed leather or 
   canvas backpack or handbag containing cloth bandages, splints, 
   needles and thread (for stitching wounds), ointments, and a selection 
   of herbs for soothing pain (these don't heal damage). It also has 
   room for special medicines, such as poison antidotes or healing 
   potions, but these are not included in the standard kit. The kit is 
   useful in treating injuries of all types; a character with the 
   healing or veterinary healing proficiency without this kit or 
   equivalent may not be able to use the proficiency, depending on the situation.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Insect Repellent.</B> Applying this rare, minty 
   cream over a character's face, arms, and other areas of exposed flesh 
   repels bees, ants, and all other types of insects less than 1 Hit Die 
   in size. One application wears off after 8 hours. A jar of insect 
   repellent contains 12 applications.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Scent Lure.</B> A scent lure is a pungent liquid 
   used to attract animals in the wild. Each scent lure attracts a 
   specific type of animal, usually woodland game such as deer, wolf, or 
   fox; individual animals of the species find the odor irresistible.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Each bottle of scent lure contains five 
   applications. One application near a tree, rock, or snare has a 15% 
   chance of attracting an animal of the given species within 24 hours, 
   presuming the animal passes within 100 yards of the application (the 
   DM determines if an animal comes close enough). Extra applications do 
   not increase the chance of attraction. The scent evaporates in 24 hours.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Sleeping Bag.</B> More comfortable, but bulkier 
   than blankets, the sleeping bag is made of two layers of canvas or 
   wool, stuffed with down for warmth. The user slips inside the 
   sleeping bag and secures the open side by fastening several buckles 
   or tying a series of leather straps.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Sun Goggles.</B> Arctic or mountaineering sun 
   goggles are made from solid wood. The wearer peers through two narrow 
   slits. These reduce or eliminate the effects of dazzling lights, such 
   as fatigue from traveling under very bright sun (for example, across 
   deserts, or flat plains on cloudless days). Sun goggles also prevent 
   snowblindness, where the eyes become swollen from exposure to bright 
   sun reflecting off ice and snow. (Attack penalties for snowblindness 
   vary from -1 to -4.)</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">Sun goggles will not prevent blindness caused when a <I>light</I> 
   spell is cast directly against the wearer's eyes. Sun goggles also 
   reduce the field of vision; the wearer can't see above or below 
   without moving his head. This may increase chances of being surprised 
   or attacked from a blind side, at the DM's option.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Sunburn Ointment.</B> Characters risk damage from 
   sunburn in any terrain during seasons of bright sunlight, not only in 
   deserts, but also in the arctic, where the sun reflects off the ice 
   and snow. If characters don't protect exposed flesh with scarves, 
   mask, or other covering, they risk suffering 1 point of damage from 
   sunburn per day. An application of sunburn ointment, gives protection 
   against sunburn for a full day. A jar of sunburn ointment contains 14 applications.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunburn ointment gives no protection from 
   magical or non-magical fire; it is ineffective against any source of 
   damage other than the sun.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunburn ointment is rare, found only in 
   the best-stocked shops in large cities.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Survival Kit.</B> A character may strap this small 
   leather pouch, about four inches on each side and an inch thick, 
   around his thigh, upper arm, or anywhere else where it can remain 
   concealed. The kit contains a number of small items useful in 
   emergencies: a scrap of parchment and piece of graphite (for writing 
   messages), a fish hook, a 25-foot length of fishing line on a spool, 
   one gold piece (good for bribing guards), a small razor (for severing 
   rope or inflicting 1 hit point of damage against captors), a wooden 
   whistle (for signaling), a cloth pad (for making an emergency 
   bandage), and a few pieces of sugar candy and dried fruit (for quick 
   energy, or luring animals). Similar items may be substituted to 
   customize individual kits.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Tents.</B> These portable shelters, usually made of 
   canvas or tanned animal skin, provide shelter from the elements for 
   weary travelers. They're easy to erect and light to carry. Here a few 
   of the most popular small tents, suitable for one or two occupants:</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> <I>Bell Tent.</I> 
   This is one of the simplest tents, consisting of a single sheet of 
   fabric arranged around a pole to form a cone. Ropes attached to 
   stakes surrounding the bottom of the tent are pulled to stretch the 
   fabric tight. Though quick to construct and easy to transport, bell 
   tents don't provide much protection against strong winds.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> <I>Wedge Tent.</I> 
   Also known as an A-frame tent or a wall tent, the wedge tent is built 
   on a frame consisting of two vertical poles with a horizontal pole 
   secured between them. The fabric is laid across the horizontal pole, 
   then stretched with ropes attached to stakes. The wedge tent is 
   somewhat sturdier than the bell tent, although like that tent, it 
   provides only modest protection against severe weather.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> <I>Pyramid Tent.</I> 
   Combining elements of both the bell and wedge tents, the pyramid tent 
   frame is made of four vertical poles arranged in a square, with 
   horizontal poles attached between them. A longer pole rises from the 
   center of the square. The fabric extends from the center pole to form 
   four slanting walls, secured with stakes. The sturdy pyramid tent 
   resists light to moderate winds.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> <I>Bundle Tent.</I> 
   Particularly useful in cold climates, the bundle tent consists of 
   from six to eight ribs about five feet long, connected to each other 
   by the tent covering. The covering consists of two layers of skin 
   from a furry animal, such as a bear or caribou. The layers are 
   arranged fur-side out, creating a pocket of air for extra insulation. 
   The tent opens like an umbrella to form a domed shape or folds into a bundle.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Traps.</B> These finely-crafted metal traps can be 
   set up in a matter of minutes. Two general types are available; both 
   come in <I>small</I> (rabbit), <I>medium</I> (wolf), and <I>large</I> 
   (bear) varieties. A character using either type of trap adds a +1 
   bonus to his set snares proficiency checks.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> <I>Enclosing Trap:</I> 
   This type of trap resembles a box. It catches animals alive. Lured by 
   edible bait or a shiny object, the animal enters the box and steps on 
   a trigger which causes the front of the box to snap shut.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT> <I>Killing Trap:</I> 
   A killing traps has two metal jaws lined with sharp points. A small 
   platform, which holds a lure, rests in between the jaws. The 
   slightest pressure on the platform causes the jaws to snap shut, 
   killing the animal.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Tinderbox, Waterproof.</B> This waterproof box 
   contains flint and steel, along with a small supply of wood shavings 
   for kindling. The box keeps the contents dry during a rainstorm or 
   when submerged underwater. Once per round, a character can attempt to 
   start a fire using these materials. A roll of 1 or 2 on a 1d8 is 
   necessary to start a fire in normal, dry conditions. A 1 on a 1d8 is 
   necessary if the area is damp; the DM may require more difficult 
   rolls (for instance, a 1 on 1d12) in wet terrain, or may rule that a 
   fire can't be started at all.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Weaponblack</B>. When rangers or thieves apply this 
   oily paste to their weapons or armor, it makes the metallic surfaces non-reflective
    and nearly invisible. Modify their base chance to hide in shadows by 
   +5%. A coat of weaponblack lasts until the character engages in melee 
   combat, at which time enough of the substance flakes away to negate 
   any camouflaging advantage. The substance is flammable; if lighted, a 
   sword coated with the paste will become the equivalent of a <I>flametongue</I> 
   for 2-5 rounds, and will also inflict 1d4 points of heat damage upon 
   the wielder unless he is magically protected. A vial of weaponblack 
   contains 1 application. This substance is uncommon and only available 
   through shady under-the-counter dealing.</FONT></P>
