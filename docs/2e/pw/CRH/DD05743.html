 Each ranger is a unique individual with his own feelings, motivations, and
personal history. Because there are an endless number of possibilities for ranger
personalities, step-by-step guidelines for generating them are not practical,
nor are they particularly desirable. Strong characters have constantly evolving
personalities, reflecting their experiences as well as their players'
inclinations. Just about anything goes, so long as the DM approves and the resulting
character is fun to play.
<P></P>
   Look over the topics in this chapter and consider how they relate to your
character. Ask yourself how he become a ranger in the first place. Where does he
come from? What drives him? What makes him feel angry, happy, fulfilled? How does
he spend his free time? As you answer these and other questions, your mental
image of the character should begin to sharpen. Before you know it, he'll be as
familiar as an old friend.
