  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Rangers can train their animal followers 
   to perform a remarkable variety of tricks and tasks. Because of the 
   ranger's unique rapport with his animal followers, he can teach them 
   more efficiently than other characters are able to train normal 
   animals. And because of the followers' eagerness to please, they 
   learn their tricks and tasks more quickly.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Two methods are provided for representing 
   this special relationship with animal followers. The Standard method 
   is the simplest and most straightforward, but treats all animals more 
   or less the same. The Alternative method requires extra bookkeeping, 
   but is a bit more realistic, as it takes into account the learning 
   capacities of different species. Both methods are similar to and 
   compatible with the animal training proficiency (the animal training 
   proficiency itself isn't used to train followers). Whichever method 
   you prefer, it's best to stick with it throughout the entire campaign.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp; Before examining the training methods, let's 
   clarify what is meant by tricks and tasks. These definitions apply to 
   the animal training proficiency as well as the training methods 
   described below.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A <I>trick</I> is a specific action 
   performed in response to a specific stimulus, such as a command, a 
   sound, or a gesture. The action involves only a single step and 
   requires no independent decision-making. In every instance, the 
   animal performs the action exactly as taught, without improvisation 
   of any kind. The stimulus must be unambiguous and precise 
   (&quot;stay&quot;); any variance in the stimulus (&quot;Don't 
   move&quot;) is likely to be misinterpreted, resulting in a failure to 
   perform the trick as intended.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A <I>task</I> is general sequence of 
   actions performed in response to a stimulus. The action may involve 
   multiple steps and require some independent decision-making. 
   Completion of the task may require a certain amount of improvisation. 
   The stimulus may be non-specific (for instance, if taught the task of 
   tracking, the follower is able to track a variety of animals, not 
   just one particular species). Obviously, tasks are more difficult to 
   master than tricks.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>The Standard Method</B></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; This training method uses essentially the 
   same rules as the animal training proficiency described in Chapter 5 
   of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>. The ranger announces the trick or 
   task he wishes to teach a particular follower (examples of tricks and 
   tasks are given below). The DM may disallow the trick or task if he 
   decides the follower is incapable of performing it; a reptile, for 
   instance, may be too dull to come on command, or a chipmunk may lack 
   the attention span needed to track. If the DM approves, the ranger 
   proceeds. It takes the ranger 2d4 weeks to teach a trick to a 
   follower and two months to teach a task.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; When the training period ends, the ranger 
   makes a Wisdom check (using his own Wisdom score). If the check 
   succeeds, the animal has mastered the trick or task. If the check 
   fails, the ranger can make another attempt to teach the follower the 
   same trick or task by expending the same time and effort. He then 
   makes another Wisdom check. If it succeeds, the animal learns the 
   trick or task. If it fails, then the animal cannot be trained to 
   perform that trick or task. A follower can learn a maximum of 2d4 
   tasks or tricks, in any combination of the two.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A ranger can train up to three followers 
   at the same time. As all followers are naturally cooperative with the 
   ranger, he doesn't need to prepare &quot;wild&quot; animal followers 
   by taming them (unlike the requirement given in the animal training proficiency).</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Successful training assumes the ranger 
   works with the followers for short periods on a regular basis; the 
   amount of time spent is less important than working with the follower 
   every day. If the ranger fails to maintain a regular schedule--say, 
   if he skips a full week or so of training--he must start over, 
   investing another two months for a task or 2d4 weeks for a trick.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The DM should write down the number of 
   tricks and tasks a particular follower is able to learn. The player 
   should also note the tricks and tasks on his ranger's record sheet as 
   the followers learn them. Additionally, when teaching a follower a 
   new trick or task, the player should keep track of how many weeks 
   have passed for each training period.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>The Alternative Method</B></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Alternative method involves the use 
   of a <I>trainability rating</I>, a general indication of a follower's 
   capacity to learn. The higher the trainability rating, the more 
   tricks and tasks an animal can know and the faster it can master 
   them. The trainability rating is primarily based on the animal's 
   Intelligence score, but also takes into account its fondness for 
   humans and demihumans, its willingness to learn, and its eagerness to 
   please. Trainability ratings apply only to a ranger's followers and 
   have no bearing on the relationships between animals and other 
   character classes or on the animal training proficiency.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Tables 31-42 give trainability ratings 
   for a variety of animal followers. The DM can use the trainability 
   ratings in these tables as guidelines for assigning ratings to 
   species not listed, should he decide to modify or expand the tables.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The DM may also make exceptions for 
   animal individuals. He may decide, for instance, that a particular 
   squirrel is smart enough to merit a Medium rating rather than the Low 
   rating given on Table 34. Likewise, he may rule that an exceptionally 
   dull wolf deserves no better than a Low rating. In any case, the DM 
   should make such a determination as soon as the follower arrives. A 
   follower's trainability rating should not change once it has been assigned.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The four ratings--Negligible, Low, 
   Medium, and High--are discussed in detail below. Each describes the 
   types of animals encompassed by the rating, the time required to 
   learn tricks and tasks, and the maximum number of tricks and tasks 
   that followers with the rating can learn. For convenience, Table 44 
   summarizes this information.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, each description lists 
   several tricks and tasks associated with the rating. The lists don't 
   include all possible tricks and tasks, but a general sample; the DM 
   should use the lists as a basis to determine the difficulty of any 
   other trick or task that the ranger wishes to teach a follower. A 
   follower can learn tricks and tasks associated with all lesser 
   ratings, as well as those associated with its own rating; a Medium 
   trainability follower, for instance, can learn tricks and tasks 
   associated with Negligible, Low, and Medium ratings.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; In all other respects, the Alternative 
   method uses the same rules as the Standard method. Only the types and 
   numbers of tricks and tasks, along with the training times, are different.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Negligible Trainability</B></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; This category includes animals with 
   little aptitude for learning, such as fish, insects, arachnids, and 
   reptiles. Most of these creatures have Intelligence scores of 0. 
   Followers with negligible trainability can learn only the simplest 
   tricks, such as those requiring movement towards or away from a 
   stimulus. They can't learn tasks. Since some of these creatures are 
   unable to discern sound, the ranger may need to use a bright light 
   (such as a torch) or a broad gesture (a sweep of the hands) instead 
   of a vocal command to get the follower to respond.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A follower with negligible trainability 
   can learn no more than a few (1d4) tricks, though the DM may decide 
   that a particular animal is not capable of learning <I>any</I> 
   tricks. Training time is 2d6 weeks per trick.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Sample tricks:</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Withdraw.</B> The follower moves away 
   from the ranger at maximum speed for 1-4 rounds, then stops.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Come.</B> The follower advances toward 
   ranger at maximum speed, stopping when it comes within a few feet.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Stay.</B> The follower stays in place 
   for 2-12 rounds, after which it resumes its normal activity.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Attack.</B> The follower aggressively 
   attacks any creature indicated by the ranger. The attacks persist 
   until the ranger breaks the command. Whether a follower fights to the 
   death is up to the DM; in many cases, a follower in danger of losing 
   its life (an animal that has lost half of its hit points) will 
   withdraw. If the ranger commands such an animal to continue its 
   attacks, a morale check may be in order (see the </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="DD05702.html">Parting
    Company</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> section below). Animals 
   that have been attack-trained usually have a base morale of at least 11.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;Attack-trained animals get a save vs. rods 
   against another ranger's <I>animal empathy</I> ability.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Low Trainability</B></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Animals in this category have an average 
   but unexceptional aptitude for learning. They can learn a wide range 
   of tricks, but few tasks. The category includes herd animals, small 
   mammals, and birds, most of which have Intelligence scores of 1. The 
   majority of animals either belong to this category or the Medium 
   trainability category.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A follower with Low trainability can 
   learn 2-8 (2d4) tricks and tasks, of which half or less can be tasks. 
   Training time is 2-8 (2d4) weeks per trick and 10 weeks for tasks.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Sample tricks:</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Heel.</B> The follower remains within 
   a few feet of the ranger, mimicking his movement. The follower tries 
   to move as fast as the ranger, stop when he stops, and stay with him 
   until the ranger breaks the command. This type of movement is 
   distinct from the follower's normal movement, as the follower remains 
   at the ranger's side at all times, rather than lurking in back of the 
   party. Mastery of the Come and Stay tricks usually precedes the 
   learning of this trick.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Sit</B>. The follower sits on its 
   haunches until the ranger breaks the command, at which time the 
   follower resumes its normal actions. Variations include Standing, 
   Rearing, Rolling Over, Playing Dead, and other simple physical feats, 
   all of which are distinct tricks and require individual training periods.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Speak.</B> The follower growls, barks, 
   chirps, or makes any other natural sound on command.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Fetch.</B> The follower retrieves a 
   specific object and brings it to the ranger. Typical objects include 
   coins, balls, bones, or sticks. In order for the follower to execute 
   the command, the ranger must first show the object to the follower 
   before throwing it or hiding it. The follower won't search 
   indefinitely; if the ranger tosses the object in a field of high 
   grass, for instance, the follower may search for 10-30 minutes before 
   giving up and returning to the ranger. Note that the Fetch trick 
   doesn't allow the follower to hunt for and recognize objects 
   belonging to a general category; that is, a follower can't enter a 
   building and look for hidden gems or other treasure items.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Carry Rider.</B> This assumes the 
   animal is physically able to carry a rider. It obeys simple movement 
   commands from the rider, such as turning left and right, stopping, 
   and trotting. However, the follower can't execute any of the 
   maneuvers associated with the Stunt Riding task explained in the 
   Medium trainability section below. This does not replace riding 
   proficiency; any maneuvers performed by the rider, such as using the 
   mount as a shield or leaping from the steed's back to the ground, 
   require the riding proficiency checks.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Sample tasks:</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Retrieve.</B> The follower can locate 
   and bring back a specific type of item from a general location. Such 
   items might include coins, jewelry, weapons, or food; a general 
   location might be the interior of a building, a grove of trees, or a 
   shallow stream. The ranger must show the follower a sample similar to 
   the desired item, and must also indicate the area which the follower 
   is to search. The follower won't search indefinitely; if unable to 
   find an item, it usually will return empty-handed (or empty-mouthed) 
   within an hour.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Bodyguard.</B> The follower protects 
   the ranger or a designated friend from attacks by keeping opponents 
   at bay or by attacking them directly, as commanded by the ranger. The 
   follower will fight alongside the ranger, making its own decisions 
   which enemies to attack (it may, for instance, attack an unnoticed 
   opponent sneaking up behind the ranger). The Attack trick must be 
   learned before this task.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Medium Trainability</B></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Exceptionally bright animals belong to 
   this group, including those commonly found as pets, trained for 
   circuses, or used in warfare. These animals will tend to have 
   Intelligence scores in the 2-4 range.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A follower with medium trainability is 
   able to learn 4-10 (2d4+2) tricks or tasks in any combination. 
   Training time is 2d3 (2-6) weeks for tricks, and 8 weeks for tasks.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Sample tasks:</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Track.</B> The follower can follow the 
   trail of an animal, human, or demihuman; in general, only followers 
   capable of tracking prey by scent are eligible to learn this task. 
   The follower must be familiar with the creature being tracked, or the 
   ranger must provide a sample of the scent (a piece of clothing, a 
   scrap of hide). It can retrace its path to lead the ranger to the 
   creature. If the follower assists the ranger in tracking, the ranger 
   adds +1 to his Tracking proficiency checks (see </FONT><FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><A HREF="DD05690.html">Chapter
    2</A></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="3">). If the follower is tracking by 
   itself, it makes Tracking checks independently of the ranger. Assume 
   that the base Tracking score of a wolf, lion, or similar predator 
   ranges from 13-16. A hunting dog's score may be as high as 19, while 
   a young badger's score as low as 11; the DM makes the call.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Stunt Riding.</B> An animal follower with this 
   proficiency can ride, performing all of the feats associated with the 
   airborne and land-based riding proficiencies (as appropriate to the 
   follower's size and species). For airborne mounts, animal's Stunt 
   Riding score is the same as the ranger's Wisdom score, with a -2 
   penalty. For land-based mounts, the Stunt Riding score is equal to 
   the ranger's Wisdom score, with a +3 bonus. Therefore, a ranger with 
   Wisdom 14 who wants his stunt-riding dog to balance on a horse 
   leaping a gap wider than 12 feet must roll his Riding score of 17 or 
   less (14 for his Wisdom, +3 for a land-based mount).</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>High Trainability</B></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a handful of followers, such as 
   dolphins and certain primates, qualify for this category. Animals 
   with high trainability can reason, weigh options, and arrive at their 
   own conclusions. Their ability to learn tasks rivals that of some 
   humans and demihumans. Their Intelligence scores begin at 5 and go up.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A follower with high trainability can 
   learn 6-12 (2d4+4) tricks or tasks, or any combination of the two. 
   Training time is 1d4 weeks for tricks, and 6 weeks for tasks.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Sample tasks:</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Lookout.</B> As directed by the 
   ranger, the follower stands watch or scouts ahead, keeping alert for 
   signs of trouble. If the follower perceives a threat, it 
   unobtrusively alerts the ranger. This training includes a special 
   signal the follower can give for the ranger's species enemy.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Complex Chore.</B> The follower can 
   perform a complex chore requiring decision-making or a relatively 
   detailed series of steps. Such chores include building a fire, 
   washing dishes, or grooming a horse. Learning each chore requires a 
   separate training period.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Weapon Use.</B> The follower wields a 
   sword, dagger, or other simple weapon, using it when attacking. Each 
   weapon requires its own training period, and opposable thumbs are 
   needed in most instances. This task is most useful when the follower 
   has already mastered the Attack trick or Bodyguard task, described above.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Not Applicable (-)</B></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Creatures who can communicate with spoken 
   language and whose Intelligence scores are on par with those of 
   humans don't have trainability ratings. To determine their behavior 
   as followers, consult the guidelines in the Humans and Demihumans 
   section below, along with the relevant information in their <I>Monstrous
    Compendium&reg; </I>entries.</FONT></P>
