<P></P>
   The following modifications are used in addition to the information in the
proficiency descriptions given in Chapter 5 of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>. The modifications apply to rangers only. Except where specified otherwise,
rangers must spend the slot points indicated in Table 55 to acquire any
proficiency.
<P></P>
   Whenever a proficiency bonus is indicated, the bonus is added to the normal
check modifier. For example, if a terrain-specialized ranger with a Wisdom of 14
uses direction sense (Wis +1) in his primary terrain (+2), the check is made at
Wis +3. A roll of 17 or less on 1d20 is a success.

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
   A ranger's animal empathy ability (see Chapter 2) can produce essentially the
same calming effect on an animal as the animal handling proficiency. If a
ranger also has the animal handling proficiency, he may attempt to soothe an animal
either by making a proficiency check or by using his <I>animal empathy</I> ability--but not both.
<P></P>
   If an animal is among a ranger's followers, neither animal empathy nor the
animal handling proficiency is necessary to control the follower. Use the
guidelines in Chapter 3 instead.
<P></P>
   The animal handling proficiency has no effect on a ranger's species enemy.
<P></P>

<P></P>

<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
   Rangers are more efficient than other characters at training animals. In the
Standard method (see Chapter 3) a ranger needs two months to train an animal to
perform a general task. Training for a specific trick requires 2d4 weeks. At
the end of the training period, he makes a proficiency check. If the check is
successful, the animal has learned the task or trick. If the check fails, the
ranger may make a second attempt at teaching it the same task (requiring another
two months) or trick (requiring another 2d4 weeks), followed by a second
proficiency check. If this second proficiency check fails, the animal is too dumb or
too stubborn to learn that particular trick or task. The ranger may repeat the
training process with a different trick or task. An animal can learn a maximum of
2d4 tasks or tricks, in any combination of the two.
<P></P>
   The animal training proficiency isn't necessary to train followers. Use the
guidelines in Chapter 3 instead.
<P></P>
   A species enemy can't be trained by the ranger, neither with the follower
guidelines nor the animal training proficiency.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Riding, Airborne and Land-based
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
   A ranger cannot use his species enemy as an airborne or land-based mount. If
the mount is a follower, use the guidelines in Chapter 3 instead of the
proficiency rules.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Survival
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
   All rangers have basic survival skills in their primary terrain. Additional
proficiency slots may be spent to add more terrain types. Thus, if a ranger
spends slots to acquire this proficiency, he must choose a terrain type other than
his primary terrain, giving him the survival proficiency in two types of terrain.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B>Tracking
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
   Most rangers will have this proficiency in outdoor land terrain without
spending any slots, as discussed in Chapter 2. Generally, success chances in urban,
man-made, or aquatic terrains are halved, unless a specific kit description says
otherwise. Some kits give tracking in alternative terrains instead of the
usual outdoor land environment.
