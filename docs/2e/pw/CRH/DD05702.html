  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; If a ranger treats his followers well, 
   they'll remain with him indefinitely. If the ranger has not neglected 
   the well-being of his followers, or violated their trust, loyalty 
   checks for them are rarely necessary.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>When a Follower Abandons a Ranger</B></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is a limit as to how much 
   abuse a follower will tolerate. The actions--or inaction--of the 
   ranger may necessitate morale checks, as determined by the DM. Should 
   a morale check succeed, the follower remains with the ranger. Should 
   a check fail, the follower goes its own way, in most cases never to 
   return. Followers who permanently abandon their ranger are considered 
   lost and are not replaced.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are some situations that may result 
   in a follower abandoning its ranger. It's up to the DM to decide when 
   a given situation becomes stressful enough for the follower to 
   require a morale check.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Inhospitable Terrain.</B> An animal 
   may hesitate to enter an environment radically different from its 
   own. A hawk follower native to the mountains probably won't resist 
   following a ranger into a forest or plain, but it may balk at 
   entering an arctic region. Even if an animal follows a ranger into 
   hostile terrain, it may not remain there for long; for example, a 
   hawk may tolerate the freezing climate of the arctic for no more than 
   a day or two.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Reckless Endangerment.</B> Followers 
   trained for combat willingly participate in encounters that may 
   result in injury or even death. However, if the ranger forces an 
   animal to participate in an unrelenting series of battles, resulting 
   in serious damage or chronic fatigue, the follower may rebel and 
   leave. Likewise, if a ranger regularly compels an animal to follow 
   him into caverns, ruins, and similarly dangerous places, the animal 
   may flee.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Starvation.</B> Though followers 
   usually find their own food, in certain situations they may depend on 
   their rangers for nourishment. If a ranger neglects to keep a 
   follower fed, the follower may decide to look for greener pastures.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mistreatment. </B>Most followers won't 
   stand for beatings, whippings, or other physical mistreatment. (Being 
   of noble character, most rangers won't administer such punishments, 
   but exceptions do occur.) If the ranger persists in this behavior, 
   abandonment is inevitable.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp; <B>Inattention.</B> Some followers, 
   particularly dogs and other domestic animals, have emotional as well 
   as physical needs. A ranger who consistently ignores or withholds 
   praise and affection from his followers risks losing them.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mating Season.</B> An animal's urge to 
   mate may overwhelm its loyalty to its ranger. An animal may disappear 
   during mating season and never return, particularly if it has trouble 
   finding a suitable partner. Morale checks usually aren't applicable 
   in these situations; instead, the DM may take advantage of mating 
   season to restore balance to the game by eliminating a powerful 
   follower, or getting rid of a cumbersome follower that's proving to 
   be too much of a burden to a ranger.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Impending Death.</B> When certain 
   followers reach the end of their days, due to illness or old age, 
   they may abandon their ranger to die alone (an aged elephant 
   journeying to an elephant's graveyard). Morale checks aren't usually 
   necessary. Instead, the DM may engineer a poignant scene where the 
   ranger realizes that death is near for his loyal companion, and must 
   come to terms with the loss.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>When a Ranger Abandons a Follower</B></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Situations may arise where the ranger 
   wants to rid himself of a particular follower. A follower with 
   negligible trainability may prove to be more annoying than helpful. A 
   filthy or frightening follower may make the party uncomfortable. A 
   follower may eat too much, move too slowly, or scare off too many 
   NPCs. Whatever the reason, the ranger has two options for abandoning 
   a follower, either of which he can exercise any time he likes.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Release.</B> This is a form of 
   temporary abandonment. Using commanding gestures and a firm voice, 
   the ranger lets the follower know that he wants it to remain behind. 
   Because of the special bond between the follower and the ranger, the 
   follower instinctively understands what the ranger is telling it, and 
   responds by reluctantly wandering away into the wilderness. Should 
   the ranger return to the general area where he released the follower, 
   and call out to the follower or otherwise make his presence known, 
   the released animal may show up again, ready to resume its role as a 
   follower. (The DM decides if a released follower returns; generally, 
   if the ranger attempts to locate the follower within a few months of 
   its release, the animal will show up within a day or so. Otherwise, 
   the ranger should assume that the released follower has died or relocated.)</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dismiss.</B> This is a form of 
   permanent abandonment. As with release, the ranger communicates his 
   desire to dismiss a follower through a series of gestures and vocal 
   commands. The dismissed follower moves away into the wilderness, 
   never to be seen again. A dismissed follower will not return to the 
   ranger. A ranger can't replace dismissed followers; they still count 
   against his normal limit.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT COLOR="MAROON"><B>Other Options</B></FONT></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; A ranger who doesn't want to release or 
   dismiss an unwanted animal follower has a host of other options, 
   limited only by his imagination and the DM's approval. He can arrange 
   for a farmer, a zoo keeper, or other NPC to care for the follower 
   (making sure, of course, the caretaker is of good alignment). He can 
   keep it in his stronghold, asking a human or demihuman follower to 
   care for it. He can also give it to a friendly NPC as a gift (again, 
   presuming the NPC is of good alignment; failure to do so may be taken 
   as a sign of betrayal by the ranger's remaining followers).</FONT></P>
