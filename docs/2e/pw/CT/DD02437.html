Withdrawing is the only safe way to leave a square that is threatened by an
opponent. When a character withdraws, he backs carefully away from his opponent
without turning his back or creating an attack of opportunity for his opponent.
<P></P>
 Withdrawing is a half-move that takes place on the character’s base
initiative. A withdrawing character cannot attack or cast spells, although he can still
get attacks of opportunity.
