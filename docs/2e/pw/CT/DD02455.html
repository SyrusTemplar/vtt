<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">If a creature is able to position itself for a rear or flank attack, it gains
a significant advantage. Flank attacks get a +1 bonus to hit, and rear attacks
a +2 bonus. A thief attacking from the rear can declare a <I>backstab </I>and gain a +4 bonus to his attack roll. In addition to the attacker
advantages, the defender’s shield doesn’t help against flank attacks on his unshielded
side nor on <I>any </I>rear attacks. Last but not least, the defender’s Dexterity adjustment doesn’t
count against rear attacks, since the defender can’t see the attack coming and
attempt to dodge it.
