</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Although critical hits are mentioned in the core AD&amp;D rules as an option, this
system works differently than any provided there. A critical hit may occur
when a character rolls exceptionally well during his attack. The attack roll must
be a natural 18 or higher, and the roll must hit the target by at least 5. A
1st-level fighter with a THAC0 of 20 can achieve a critical against an opponent
with AC 5, since he can roll a 20 and hit him with 5 to spare, but he can’t get
a critical against an opponent with AC 4 (or better).
<P></P>
 As a basic rule, critical hits inflict double damage. However, <A HREF="DD02717.html#bcdf214c"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02717.html#bcdf214c">Chapter Six</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> is devoted to the topic of critical hits and presents an integrated system
that accounts for the strength of the blow, the location injured, and a dash of
luck.
<P></P>
 If PCs can get critical hits with great attack rolls, monsters should be able
to as well. Otherwise, the balance of the game shifts in favor of the player
characters.
