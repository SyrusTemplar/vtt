<P></P>
The second, and more detailed, system for critical hits uses the same attack
mechanic as the previous one. As above, the attacker must roll a natural 18 or
higher and hit his opponent by a margin of 5 or more. Then, if the victim fails
a saving throw vs. death, a specific injury occurs. However, the effects are
determined by four factors: the attacker’s weapon size compared to the defender’s
size, the type of weapon compared to the type of target, the location of the
hit, and a roll for the injury’s severity.
