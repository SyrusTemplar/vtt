</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">If a rock is dropped on a group all scaling the wall by the same route,
ladder, or rope, the attacker makes a normal attack roll against the lead climber.
Every creature below the leader must roll a successful saving throw vs. breath
weapon to avoid being hit as well. The other climbers receive a +3 bonus to the
save if the initial attack misses.
