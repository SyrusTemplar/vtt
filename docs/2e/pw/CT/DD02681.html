To check for a hold, the combatants make an opposed attack roll vs. AC 10
(Dexterity and magical bonuses apply). Strength bonuses apply, along with the
following modifiers:
<P></P>

<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> 4-point bonus or penalty per size difference of the attacker versus the
defender;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> –1 for a defender normally immune to the attack;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> –2 for defenders with unusually supple bodies (snakes, eels, worms, etc.).
<P></P>

<P></P>
 The attacker must win the opposed roll to achieve a hold. If the defender
wins, if there is a tie, or if both rolls fail, the attacker is driven back to his
original square and the grapple is broken. Both characters retain their
original facings.
<P></P>
 If the attacker wins the opposed roll, the attacker achieves a hold. The
defender suffers 1d2 points of damage unless immune to the attack, and the attacker
can try for a lock during his next attack. A hold lasts until the attacker
frees the defender, or the defender breaks free. Grappled characters cannot move
until they free themselves, and they cannot make attacks of opportunity. Checking
for a hold ends the attacker’s action phase; the character cannot attack again
until he would normally be eligible for a melee attack (usually the next
combat round); however, the character can counter the defender’s attempts to get
free (by making opposed rolls).
<P></P>
 Strength bonuses to attack and damage rolls apply to all wrestling attacks,
holds, and locks.
