For thousands of years, climate and terrain have played critical roles in the
development of military tactics and the evolution of the battle. In flat, open
lands, cavalry became the dominant force on the battlefield because the terrain
favored mobility. But even the best horsemen lose most of their mobility in
heavy forest, swamp, or rugged mountains. The commander who learns to use the
terrain to his advantage becomes a formidable enemy.

 In many AD&amp;D games, the battlefield itself is often ignored or portrayed in a
colorless, abstract manner. This chapter explores the various types of
battlefields and their characteristics, with two goals in mind: creating more scenic
and visual sites for your PCs’ heroic encounters, and providing players and
Dungeon Masters with another level of battlefield detail to reward quick thinking
and sound tactics.
