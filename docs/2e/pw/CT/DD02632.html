This is the basic level of competence most characters achieve with their
weapons training. Proficiency allows the character to use a weapon with no penalties
and employ all attack options and special weapon properties to their fullest
extent.

 As noted previously, warriors can spend two proficiency slots to become
proficient in a tight weapon group, or three slots to become proficient in a broad
group. Otherwise, characters have to spend one slot per weapon they wish to be
proficient with.
