This is dark, dense forest with heavy undergrowth and closely spaced trees.
The thick growth severely limits visibility and it is very easy to blunder into
an enemy without ever knowing he was there. The Appalachian forests and the
Pacific Northwest are good examples of heavy forest.

<B>Footing: </B>Heavy undergrowth and close-set trees reduce all movement by 1/3.
<P></P>
<B>Obstacles: </B>Trees and thickets.
<P></P>
<B>Unusual: </B>A ready supply of branches can provide clubs or sharpened stakes in no time at
all. In some forests, heavy vines can be used for snares or lassoes.

 It’s dangerous to ride at high speed in a forest; the rider of any mount
moving at a run or gallop has a 1 in 6 chance per turn of being struck by a branch.
The rider must roll a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation or be unhorsed,
suffering 1d6 points of damage in the process.
<P></P>
 Dense forests severely restrict flying creatures of Size L or bigger. Such
monsters must land in a clear area and approach their prey on the ground, since
there is not enough space between the trees to unfurl their wings.
