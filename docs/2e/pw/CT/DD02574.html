</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Under the best of circumstances, characters can see no more than 100 feet
underwater (50 feet in fresh water.) For each 10 feet they descend, this range of
vision is reduced by 10 feet; if a character is 30 feet underneath the surface
of a lake, he can only see 20 feet. If it is dark outside or the water is muddy,
this could be reduced even more.
