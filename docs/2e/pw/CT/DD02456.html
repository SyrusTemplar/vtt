</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Characters may sit, kneel, or fall prone as a no-move action. Getting up from
sitting or kneeling is considered a half-move action, so a character can stand
and still fire a missile or make an attack. Standing up from a prone position
is treated as a full-move action, so the character can do nothing else in that
round except rise.
<P></P>
 Sitting or kneeling characters are slightly harder to hit with missiles or
thrown weapons; they gain an Armor Class bonus of –1 against any ranged attacks.
However, they’re at a disadvantage in melee. Anyone making a melee attack
against a sitting or kneeling character gains a +2 bonus to hit them.
<P></P>
 Prone characters present very small missile targets and gain an AC bonus of –2
versus ranged attacks. However, they are very vulnerable to anyone close
enough to threaten them. Melee attacks against prone characters gain a +4 bonus to
hit.
<P></P>
 Kneeling characters can use any weapon with no penalty. Sitting characters can
only use crossbows without a penalty; with any other weapon, they suffer a –2
penalty to their attack rolls. (Note that characters on horseback are mounted,
not sitting!) Prone characters can only use crossbows or size S weapons while
they’re on the ground. A prone character firing a crossbow attacks at one-half
the normal rate of fire and makes any melee attacks with a –4 penalty to hit.
