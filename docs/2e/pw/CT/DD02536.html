Adventurers seem to find fights in caves all the time. A typical cave is
small, twisted, and dark, with uneven floors and hanging stalactites and sharp
stalagmites. If the battle is taking place in a colossal cavern, it’s better to
consider it an open field or hillside under total darkness.

<B>Encounter Range: </B>By range of visibility.
<P></P>
<B>Lines of fire: </B>Impaired.
<P></P>
<B>Cover: </B>Hard cover is available within 1d3 spaces of any character.
<P></P>
<B>Footing: </B>Some cave floors may be muddy or slick, but generally footing is okay.
<P></P>
<B>Obstacles: </B>Rock formations and crevasses.
<P></P>
<B>Unusual: </B>If the lights go out, caves are pitch black. Fighting in total darkness gives
the attacker a –4 penalty on attack rolls and a random chance of attacking
anyone engaged with him, including friends.
<P></P>
 Stalagmites can skewer an unfortunate character who falls on one; any
character who is tripped or knocked down has a 1 in 10 chance of falling on a
stalagmite. The stalagmite “attacks” with a THAC0 of 15 and inflicts 2d10 points of
damage if it hits. A successful saving throw vs. paralyzation for half damage
applies.
