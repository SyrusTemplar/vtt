This category includes slings and thrown weapons. Generally, specialists gain
an increased rate of fire with these weapons and a +1 bonus to attack rolls. If
a character specializes in a weapon that can be used either for melee or as a
missile weapon (spears, daggers, hand axes, etc.), he gains the melee benefit
described above when using the weapon for hand-to-hand combat and the increased
rate of fire for using the weapon for ranged attacks.
