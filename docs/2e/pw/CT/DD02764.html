<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">If a creature’s carrying capacity is not listed in the <A HREF="../PHB/DD01639.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><I><A HREF="../PHB/DD01639.html">PHB</A></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, assume that most creatures can carry five pounds per point of Strength (see
the formula for computing this in <A HREF="DD02485.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02485.html">Chapter Two</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">); particularly large or sturdy quadrupeds can carry 10 pounds per point of
effective Strength. To these numbers add 400 pounds if the creature is Huge and
600 pounds if the creature is Gargantuan.
<P></P>
 The resulting number is the creature’s normal load, which allows movement at
the creature’s base speed. The creature can carry 150% of its normal load and
move at 2/3 speed and it can carry twice its normal load and move at 1/3 speed. A
flying creature reduced to 2/3 speed loses one maneuverability class; a flying
creature reduced to 1/3 speed cannot fly.
<P></P>
 Note that this is intended as a quick method for determining carrying
capacities. Where previously published information conflicts with the numbers presented
here, choose the one that seems most appropriate. Some sample calculations are
provided in the <A HREF="DD02764.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02764.html">table</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> on the next page.

Note that the size category of the African elephant has been altered from its
listing in the <A HREF="../MM/DD03883.html#eeab32a4"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../MM/DD03883.html#eeab32a4">Monstrous Manual</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">. It seemed only reasonable that the elephant’s carrying capacity should be
equivilant to, if not greater than, the polar bear, a Huge creature as well.
