Ethereal creatures move at their normal unencumbered rate, regardless of their
equipment and armor. Unlike the Astral Plane, the Ethereal is a swirling mass
of misty proto-matter that obscures vision; the Encounter Range is 10–40
squares (50–200 feet). Missiles tend to be slowed by the misty matter, and shots of
medium range or longer just stop and hang in the air.

 If a character is in the Border Ethereal, she can still perceive the shadowy
outlines of the plane she just left. She can move through any objects or
creatures without impediment. Of course, she is unable to affect things on the plane
she is viewing, but she can only be affected by the magical gazes of a very
limited number of monsters.
