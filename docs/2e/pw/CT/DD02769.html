In its simplest form, a battering ram consists of a sturdy beam that one or
more creatures can pick up and swing against a portal or wall to batter it down.
More complex rams have beams with reinforced heads and a frame to support the
beam. Any long, heavy object (such as a log or bench) between five and 30 feet
long can be used as a simple ram, provided there is at least five feet of free
space behind the ram (to allow the crew to swing it). A minimum of one Man-sized
creature is required of each 5 feet of ram, and a maximum of two Man-sized
creatures is allowed per five feet of ram. A ram can affect only portals,
structures, or large, stationary objects (see the <A HREF="DD02781.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02781.html">Escalades section</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, below).
<P></P>
 Creatures carrying or wielding a simple ram move and defend as though heavily
encumbered, regardless of the ram’s actual weight.
<P></P>
 A ram suspended from a frame can be from 10 to 60 feet long. A suspended ram
allows the crew to employ its strength more efficiently, inflicting more damage.
<P></P>
 A ram crew can swing the ram once a round, during the very slow phase.
