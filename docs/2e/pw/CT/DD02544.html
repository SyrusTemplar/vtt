</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Open plains are a tactician’s greatest challenge. Without any clear advantage
to be gained from controling a terrain feature, battles become contests of
maneuver and skill. Any commander can stand off a superior enemy force in rough
terrain, but it takes a genius to defeat the same force on open ground. Plains
include savannahs, dry steppes, and some grassy deserts as well as American
Midwest-style prairie.
