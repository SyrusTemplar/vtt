Mounts provide their rider with a +1 bonus to attack rolls when fighting
against unmounted opponents, while the opponents suffer a –1 penalty to attacks
against the rider (there is no penalty to attack the mount itself). Most mounts are
fairly large and can overrun smaller creatures. A normal human on horseback
can use his mount’s speed and size to trample his opponents underfoot (see <A HREF="DD02422.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02422.html">Overrun</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">). Many mounts are also capable of making attacks along with their rider.
