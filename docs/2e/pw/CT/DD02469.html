In the next round, the heroes get a little lucky. Pascal downs one of her
attackers with a critical hit, and Dain covers Lyssa’s withdrawal and inflicts
serious damage against the bugbear who had injured the mage. Another bugbear falls
when the <I>Melf’s acid arrow</I> finishes it off at the end of the round. With two more down, the DM rules
that the survivors choose a fighting withdrawal, and the heroes let the bugbears
retreat.
