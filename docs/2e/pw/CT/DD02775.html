<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This is a large hook or fork on a long pole. Typically, it can catch and hold
a ram or bore working directly below. The ram remains held, unable to attack,
until the attackers break the ram catcher or kill the crew. The ram catcher is
too small to be attacked by bombardment engines, but it is susceptible to
attacks from slashing weapons. It has an Armor Class of 2 and 30 hit points.
