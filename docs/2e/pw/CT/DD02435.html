Any character may choose to make an unarmed attack instead of attacking with
his weapons. There are four basic types of unarmed combat: punching, wrestling,
overbearing, and martial arts. Refer to <A HREF="DD02668.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02668.html">Chapter Five</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> for more information on resolving unarmed attacks.

 A character can perform an unarmed attack on his base initiative if he doesn’t
have to move to reach his target, or he can take a half-move action to close
for combat. Attacking armed opponents (including monsters with natural attacks)
is dangerous for an unarmed fighter; if the character attacks an armed creature
that is threatening him, he suffers an immediate attack of opportunity from
his intended victim. The armed defender gains a +4 bonus on his attack roll and
his damage roll against an unarmed attacker.
<P></P>
 Monsters with natural weaponry almost never make unarmed attacks. However, it
is possible for intelligent creatures to “pull in their claws” and try to
batter a character into unconsciousness. Monsters without natural attacks may resort
to unarmed combat if they are disarmed or want to capture their enemy.
