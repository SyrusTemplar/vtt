</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Battles on actual mountainsides are rare. This type of terrain represents high
passes, canyon-walls, deep valleys, high snowfields, and windswept peaks. If
the fight takes place below the treeline, consider the terrain to be hills,
forest, or fields.
<P></P>
<B>Encounter Range: </B>Long missile range.
<P></P>
<B>Lines of Fire: </B>Clear.
<P></P>
<B>Cover: </B>Hard cover is usually available within 3d10 squares of a character, but it may
take mountaineering skills to get to it.
<P></P>
<B>Footing: </B>Characters moving uphill or downhill are reduced to 1/3 normal movement or
possibly stopped altogether, depending on the grade. If no normal movement is
possible, characters may decide to climb instead.
<P></P>
<B>Obstacles: </B>Boulders, ice or snow, cliffs, dangerous slopes.
<P></P>
<B>Unusual: </B>Characters who slip or fall while climbing or moving downhill must roll a
succcessful saving throw vs. death or fall 10–60 feet (1d6x10), suffering 1d6
points of damage per 10 feet fallen. Mountainsides usually have a plentiful supply
of rocks of all sizes.
