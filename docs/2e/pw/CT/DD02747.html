Small frays between bands of adventurers and their foes are not the only
battles fought in a fantasy world. Companies of brigands roam the countryside, and
there might be scores of troops in a town guard or castle garrison. In times of
war, armies numbering in the thousands might take to the field.

 Nor are hand-held weapons such as swords and spears the only deadly implements
a hero is likely to face. Well-prepared opponents often employ war machines of
ingenious design and fearsome potential. Likewise, defenders need not depend
solely on the local terrain for protection; instead they might employ all manner
of constructions and fortifications.
