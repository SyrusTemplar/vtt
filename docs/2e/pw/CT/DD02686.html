</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">If two characters have declared wrestling attacks against each other, they
automatically grasp each other. Skip the initial attack roll and make an opposed
roll on the fastest character’s action phase to see who has the advantage. The
winner establishes a hold, or a lock if his roll was good enough to score a
critical hit.
