proficient with a weapon.

limited in their knowledge of fighting styles. If a nonwarrior wishes to learn
a style he doesn’t know, he can do so at the cost of a weapon proficiency.

 In addition to simply knowing a style, warriors, priests, and rogues can
specialize in that method of fighting by spending a weapon proficiency slot. The
exact effects of style specialization vary from style to style. Note that warriors
can specialize in a weapon, and then specialize in an appropriate style. In
fact, warriors can specialize in as many styles as they like, as long as they
have the proficiency slots (or character points) available. Priests and rogues can
only specialize in one style.
