A character can double his base movement by running. Running is considered a
full-move action; the character can’t do anything else in the same combat round
that he runs. Running on a battlefield is dangerous; the character loses all
Dexterity bonuses to his Armor Class and suffers a +1 AC penalty on top of that.
In addition, he is considered to be charging if he runs into a square
threatened by an opponent with a set spear.

 Characters can maintain a run as long as they have the necessary fatigue
points (see Fatigue<A HREF="DD02440.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02440.html">Fatigue</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, below). Outside of combat, they can run for a number of rounds equal to
their Constitution score. After that, they must stop and rest. See Jogging and
