fight, through natural circumstances or military planning. Someone might fall down
or be incapacitated by a spell. A battle fought in a thick, tangled forest may
limit archery to shots of 30 feet or less. Stinging snowstorms or sandstorms
may limit visibility and carry away light missiles. The side that considers the
characteristics of the battlefield in its tactics often gains an advantage over
its enemies. <A HREF="DD02521.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02521.html">Chapter Three</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> describes battlefields in great detail, but there are a few special rules
