 Ambidextrous characters are able to use either hand with equal coordination
and skill. They are neither right-handed nor left-handed. When fighting in
two-weapon style, an ambidextrous character has two “primary” hands, and suffers a –2
penalty to hit with either weapon. If the ambidextrous character spends a slot
to specialize in two-weapon fighting style, he suffers no penalty to attacks
with either weapon.
