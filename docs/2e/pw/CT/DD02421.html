</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A character can move through a square occupied by a friendly figure as long as
that figure isn’t threatened or attacking in the current round. Enemies can
only occupy the same square if they are grappled or if one is prone. Otherwise,
larger creatures can attempt to make an overrun.
