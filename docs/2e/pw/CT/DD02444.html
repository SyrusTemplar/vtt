Whenever characters have failed a Constitution check as a result of force
marching and are still in the process of recovering (see the <A HREF="../PHB/DD01777.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01777.html">PHB</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, Chapter 14: Time and Movement, under Cross-Country Movement), they
automatically begin the combat in a fatigued state rather than fresh. Fatigue points are
consumed at the doubled rate and all the penalties for being fatigued (as well
as the penalties for force marching) apply, until a state of exhaustion is
reached. Furthermore, creatures cannot return to a fully fresh state during the
battle; only the noncombat recovery period for force marching can remove this
restriction.
