Characters and monsters start off in a fresh state. In every phase that a
character or monster moves or attacks, check off one fatigue point. When the total
reaches 0, the character or creature is fatigued. Reset the fatigue score back
to its original value and check off two points in every phase that movement or
combat takes place. When the score reaches 0 again, the creature is exhausted.
