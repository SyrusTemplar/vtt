</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">If a fighter spends another proficiency slot on a melee weapon he already
specializes in, his attack and damage bonuses increase to +3 and +3, respectively.
For bows and crossbows, his point-blank bonuses increase to +3/+3 as with melee
weapons, and he gains an additional +1 to hit at all other range categories,
for a total of +2. (Remember, this bonus doesn’t take range modifiers into
account, so the archer has a total of +2 at short, +0 at medium, and –3 at long
range, if the penalties are factored in.)
<P></P>
 A marksman who chooses to master a firearm gains an additional +1 bonus to
hit, cumulative with the effects of specialization for a total bonus of +2 to hit.
As with bows and crossbows, this is still reduced by range penalties. In
addition, the marksman ignores heavy armor at all ranges as if he were firing at a
short-range target. See Firearms in <A HREF="DD02639.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02639.html">Chapter Seven</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> for more information.
