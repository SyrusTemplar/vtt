</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A proficient archer and rider who specializes in missile style gains a special
benefit when mounted: any penalties he suffers for shooting while riding are
reduced by 2. Normally, a character suffers a –2 penalty to missile attacks if
his mount is moving at up to half its normal speed, and a –4 penalty if his
mount is moving at full speed. Horse archers suffer no penalty for half-speed
firing, and only a –2 penalty for firing at full speed.
<P></P>
 Horse archers are rare in a typical Western European fantasy setting.
Historically, most horse archers came from central Asia. At the DM’s discretion, a
character may not qualify for this special benefit unless he has a suitable origin
or makes an effort to locate someone from that culture who can teach him.
