<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">The Effects of Magic on the Battlefield  </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Needless to say, the one thing that breaks all the rules on a battlefield is
magic. Spells and magical items can create almost any condition imaginable,
ranging from the merely annoying to the truly catastrophic. We could spend most of
this book describing the exact effect of each and every spell and magical item
in the game system, but this wouldn’t be very practical. Instead, we’ll discuss
the most common effects that may give DMs trouble.
