When a character actually moves across the battlefield, don’t pick up the
figure and then drop it back down again several spaces away. Trace the exact path
the character is following from square to square on the battle map. A character
never knows when there is a trap he may trigger or an invisible enemy
threatening part of his planned move.
<P></P>
 Characters can make any facing changes they want with no cost in movement
points during their move. Remember, too, that characters can make a single facing
change during an enemy’s move if the enemy moves adjacent to them.
