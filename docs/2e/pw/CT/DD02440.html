Fighting a prolonged battle can be exhausting. Only the most heroic characters
can stand fast against wave after wave of foes without tiring. The various
character classes gain a number of fatigue points equal to their base Hit Die
value. In other words, a warrior has 10 fatigue points, a thief 6, etc. Warriors
gain one additional fatigue point each time they gain a level; nonwarriors gain
one fatigue point every two levels. This value is modified by the hit-point
bonus or penalty for Constitution.
<P></P>
 For monsters, fatigue points are equal to 8 (since monsters use a d8 for their
Hit Dice) plus the number of Hit Dice, rounded down. Thus an ogre (4+1 Hit
Dice) has 12 fatigue points.
