Many weapons are very similar in construction and techniques of use; for
example, using a bastard sword with one hand is not too much different from using a
long sword. Both weapons are heavy, two-edged blades that rely on slashing or
chopping strokes to cut through armor. All weapons are categorized in <I>tight groups</I>, which are further organized into <I>broad groups</I>. The particular group a weapon belongs to is noted under the weapon
characteristics in <A HREF="DD02744.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02744.html">Chapter Seven</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">.

 Tight groups serve two functions in game play. First of all, all weapons in a
tight group are considered to be related to each other. A character who is
proficient in one weapon belonging to a tight group is automatically familiar with
the other weapons of that tight group and has a reduced penalty for
nonproficiency when using them.
<P></P>
 Second, characters can learn to use all weapons in a tight group with a <I>weapon group proficiency</I>. Weapon group proficiencies cost two slots, but may include a number of
weapons. For example, a character could use a weapon group proficiency to gain
proficiency in crossbows; by spending two slots, he actually gains proficiency in
six different weapons.
<P></P>
 Some tight weapon groups are further organized into broad groups. For example,
the tight groups of axes, picks, hammers, and maces are all part of the hafted
weapon broad group. Proficiency in all of the weapons of a broad weapon group
can be learned for three proficiency slots.
<P></P>
 A number of weapons are completely unrelated to anything else. For example,
lassoes just don’t work like any other type of weapon. The same applies for nets,
whips, bolas, and mancatchers. These weapons must be learned one at a time.
