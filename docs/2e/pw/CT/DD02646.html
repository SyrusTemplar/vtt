Normally, a character employing a shield in his off hand can shield-rush,
shield-punch, block, or trap as if it were a secondary weapon, with the normal
penalties for attacking with two weapons. The disadvantage is that the shield’s AC
bonus is forfeited for any round in which it is used this way.

make one of these secondary attacks every round without losing the AC benefit for
carrying a shield. If the heroic fray rules from <A HREF="DD02518.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02518.html">Chapter Two</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> are in use, the character only gets one secondary attack, not two, but his
primary weapon attacks are still doubled, of course.
