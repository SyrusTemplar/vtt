<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#800080" SIZE="4">Equipment Groups  </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">As long as people have been making weapons, different cultures have produced
different types of armaments. One wouldn’t expect to find an English longbow in
ancient Greece, or a samurai’s katana in medieval Venice. Of course, many AD&amp;D
campaigns aren’t very “realistic,” but even in the most cosmopolitan settings
there will be local standards of technology and preferred weapons and equipment.

 It’s always possible for rare or unusual weapons to trickle into an area from
outside. For example, if a tribe of jungle savages has been trading with a more
advanced culture, it’s quite likely that they may have learned metalworking or
at least be armed with steel spearheads and arrowheads they traded for.
Despite this, players should try to equip their characters in a reasonable and
consistent fashion. A Viking-like barbarian from the far north has no business
beginning a campaign equipped with a blowgun, katana, or scimitar. It’s far more
reasonable for the character to wear chain mail and carry a throwing axe and long
sword. The DM is the final judge of what a character can reasonably expect to be
able to find in any particular area.
