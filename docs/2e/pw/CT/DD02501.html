One of the most common fighting styles in the AD&amp;D game, this style provides
the character with the defensive benefits of a shield and still allows a decent
offense. In addition to the AC benefit of the shield, this style also gives the
character the attack options of shield-punch and shield-rush.
<P></P>
 There are two disadvantages to this style: first, the character is limited to
using a single one-handed weapon, since his other hand has the shield;
secondly, if he wants to quickly empty a hand, he has to drop his weapon. Most shields
are strapped to the character’s arm and take a full round to remove.
<P></P>
 Warriors and priests normally know the weapon and shield fighting style.
