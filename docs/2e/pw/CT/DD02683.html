A defender who begins an action phase in another character’s grasp cannot
move. The only combat actions he can take is an attack with a size S or natural
weapon, pummeling, or wrestling. These attacks must be directed at the opponent
grappling the character. Attacks with size S weapons and pummeling attacks suffer
a –2 attack penalty. Natural and armed attacks are not possible if the
character’s original facing would not allow them. For example, a fighter who makes a
wrestling attack from one of a lion’s rear squares could not be subjected to the
lion’s claw attacks, though the lion could turn its head to bite.
<P></P>
 If the defender scores a critical hit with a weapon or natural attack, he can
opt to inflict double damage (and perhaps roll for a special effect according
to the rules presented in <A HREF="DD02715.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02715.html">Chapter Six</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">) or force the attacker to release him. If the defender scores a knockdown
with a pummeling or weapon attack, he breaks free.
<P></P>
 If the defender makes a wrestling attack, conduct an opposed attack roll as
described above. If both attacks fail, there is no change in the combatants’
status—they remain grappled or locked and no damage is inflicted. If the defender
wins, the attacker suffers 1d2 points of damage (plus Strength bonus) and the
defender’s position improves one place. Locked defenders become grappled, and
grappled characters break free. If the defender wins with a roll good enough to
score a critical hit, the defender immediately scores a lock on the attacker and
can choose a lock result from the <A HREF="DD02685.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02685.html">table below</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">. The defender now controls the wrestling sequence and is treated as the
attacker in subsequent action phases. If the attacker wins the opposed roll, there
is no change in the defender’s status. If the attacker wins with a roll good
enough to score a critical hit, the attacker automatically achieves a lock.
