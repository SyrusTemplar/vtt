</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">All fliers with a MC of B or worse must declare a half-move action every round
just to stay in the air. Class B fliers can hover in position, but fliers with
a MC of C or worse must move forward in this half-move to stay aloft. This
requirement to keep moving means that a class C flier can make an attack against a
stationary target once per two rounds, a class D flier once per three rounds,
and a class E flier once per six rounds.
<P></P>
 Gaining a point of altitude costs an additional movement point; a flier with a
move of 18 could move 9 squares forward and 9 squares up with a full-move
action. Diving allows the flier to add one point of free movement for each point of
altitude it drops, so the flier with the 18 movement could move 36 squares in
a full-move dive. Of course, it also has to drop 18 points of altitude (90
feet) to do this.
