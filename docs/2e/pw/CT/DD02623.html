Having a weapon group proficiency counts as the first slot of specialization
for one weapon in that group. When the character chooses to specialize, he need
only spend one additional proficiency slot and select any weapon of that group
as his specialty. For example, a character with the crossbow tight group
proficiency could spend one additional slot to specialize in the medium crossbow.
He’s spent a total of three slots but has proficiency with six types of crossbows
and specialization with his preferred weapon, the medium crossbow.
