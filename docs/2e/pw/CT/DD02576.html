It’s always great fun when a wading character gets attacked by some aquatic
horror. When a character fights against something that uses water for cover,
slashing and bludgeoning weapons are useless. Only type P weapons can be used to
attack underwater creatures, and there is a –2 penalty to hit. The wading
character also loses any Dexterity adjustment to AC when attacked from beneath the
surface.
