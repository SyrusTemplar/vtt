This is a catch-all phrase for any condition or situation that may affect the
actions next round. Did a character get knocked down during the fight? He’ll
start the next round prone. Generally, magical effects and continuing damage
(poison, burning, acid, etc.) actually inflict their damage in this part of the
combat round.
