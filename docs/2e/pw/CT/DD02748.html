artillery, and massed troops are hardly commonplace), but most campaigns will
find it useful occasionally.
<P></P>
 The majority of the material in this chapter is intended for use with the
combat system from <A HREF="DD02371.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02371.html">Chapter One</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> and the Battlefield rules from <A HREF="DD02519.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02519.html">Chapter Three</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">. It is not necessary to use the combat system with any of the material in
this chapter, but your games will be greatly enhanced if you do. The rules on
fortifications presented here use many terms and concepts from the material on
battlefields, and it is necessary to be familiar with Chapter Three before using
them. The material on sieges and on mass combat is intended to stand alone.
