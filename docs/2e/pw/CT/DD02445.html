The end of the round is also the time for morale checks. Remember, player
characters never need to check morale; they’re smart enough to know when to cut and
run, and foolish enough not to run when they should. However, NPC allies or
followers of the PCs may decide to abandon them if things go poorly.
<P></P>
 Morale is discussed at length in the <A HREF="../DMG/DD00476.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../DMG/DD00476.html">Dungeon Master Guide</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, so it won’t be reiterated here. The DM is not required to make a morale roll
every round; he can use his own judgment to decide when someone might be
thinking of calling it a day. Some good guidelines of when monsters or NPCs might
make morale checks:
<P></P>

<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> When surprised;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> When faced by an obviously superior enemy force;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> When an ally is slain by magic;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> When 25% of their group has fallen;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> When 50% of their group has fallen;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> When their leader deserts or is killed;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> When they are fighting an enemy that can’t be hurt by their weapons;
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> When they are offered a chance to surrender and they’ve already met one other 
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> condition for a morale check.
