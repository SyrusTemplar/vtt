<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Most battlefields offer a fair amount of cover or concealment. This tends to
be related to encounter range and lines of fire. Cover is simply described as
available or unavailable; if there is cover present, its range from the character
looking for cover is noted.
