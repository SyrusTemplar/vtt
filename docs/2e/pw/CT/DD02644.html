Weapon mastery is hard to come by, and even harder to perfect. It’s not too
rare for a character to become a master, but the quest to become a high master or
grand master could take years. Unlike the previous levels of specialization,
which can simply be selected as an advancement choice, high mastery and grand
mastery should require a great deal of time and personal sacrifice on the part of
the character. It’s not unreasonable to require the candidate to locate
someone who can teach her and spend several months of campaign time in
training—possibly “sitting out” an adventure or two while she hones her skills.

 While the higher levels of weapon mastery are a great goal for a character to
set her eyes on, they can unbalance a game very quickly. Exercise tight control
over the acquisition of weapon mastery in your campaign, and make certain that
the players realize just how rare and special their weapon master characters
really are.
