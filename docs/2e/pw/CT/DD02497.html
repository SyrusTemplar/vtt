<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The largest and most damaging weapons available to PCs are usually two-handed
weapons. Obviously, a character with a two-handed weapon is not going to be
able to use a shield or a secondary weapon, but he does have a lot of offensive
capability.
<P></P>
 Many two-handed weapons are polearms and extended-range weapons that provide
the wielder with special tactical benefits in addition to their raw damage
potential. Note that a character doesn’t have to use both hands just to hold a
two-handed weapon; he can hang on to it with one hand to free up the other for
another activity, but he can’t attack until he gets both hands on the weapon again.
