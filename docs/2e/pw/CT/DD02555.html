Hills are surrounded by slopes. Each 10 feet of elevation requires a slope of
two to four squares to surround it. Draw a hilltop of three to ten squares at
the midpoint of each elevated area, and then circle the hilltop with a ring of
sloping squares.
<P></P>
 Broken areas may be surrounded by slopes or escarpments. Any side of an
elevated area has a 50% chance of being either a slope or an escarpment. If it is a
slope, draw it as described above. If it is an escarpment, consider it to be one
square wide.
