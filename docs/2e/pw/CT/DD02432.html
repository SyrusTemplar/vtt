Sometimes the best thing to do is take cover and try not to get clobbered. Any
character can choose to parry as a combat action. Parrying is a no-move action
that is in effect for the entire combat round. If a character parries, he
cannot move, attack, or cast spells.
<P></P>
 Parrying reduces a nonwarrior character’s Armor Class by one-half his level. A
6th-level wizard with an AC of 5 who parries reduces his AC to 2. Warriors who
choose to parry reduce their AC by one-half their level, plus one. A 6th-level
fighter gets an AC bonus of 4 by parrying.
