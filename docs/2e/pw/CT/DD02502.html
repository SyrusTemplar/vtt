<P></P>
Not to be confused with the two-handed weapon style, two weapon style uses a
weapon in each of the character’s hands. The advantage of this is clear: the
character either has more attack power or can use the secondary weapon defensively
to block incoming blows. Another benefit lies in the fact that even if the
character loses a weapon, he’s still armed.
<P></P>
 The character can use any one-handed weapon in his primary hand, but his
secondary weapon must be a size smaller than his primary weapon. Knives and daggers
can always be used, regardless of the primary weapon’s size. The character
suffers a –2 penalty to attacks with the primary weapon, and a –4 to attacks with
the secondary weapon. This penalty is offset by the character’s reaction
adjustment for high Dexterity.
<P></P>
 <I>Important Note: </I>While the character receives his normal number of attacks for class, level,
and specialization with his primary weapon, he only receives one additional
attack with his secondary weapon.
<P></P>
 Warriors and rogues know two weapon fighting style.
