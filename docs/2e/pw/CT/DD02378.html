</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Many polearms are assigned a range, much like missile weapons. A polearm with
a range of 2 can strike enemies standing in the character’s front square or any
adjacent square beyond the row of front squares.
<P></P>
 Some weapons are defined as <I>range only</I> weapons. Pikes and lances fall into this category. These weapons can be used
to make normal attacks in the squares they can reach but cannot be used against
targets in between the wielder and the weapon’s point.
<P></P>
 Creatures wielding range 2 or larger weapons or natural attack forms cannot
make melee attacks through an occupied square to another square unless as part of
a spear or pike hedge (<A HREF="DD02476.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02476.html">see Chapter Two</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">).
