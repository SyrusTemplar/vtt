<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">Two-handed Weapon Style
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Many weapons are so large that a character is required to use both hands to
wield them. The rule of thumb is simple: a character can use a weapon with a size
equal to or less than her own in one hand and can use a weapon one size larger
than herself if she wields it two-handed.
<P></P>
 If a character specializes in two-handed weapon style, she increases the speed
of her weapon by one category (slow to average, average to fast) when she
fights using a two-handed weapon. If you’re not using the new initiative rules
presented in <A HREF="DD02409.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02409.html">Chapter One</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, the weapon’s speed factor drops by 3.
<P></P>
 There are a few weapons that can normally be employed one-handed or
two-handed; these are noted in the weapons list of <A HREF="DD02742.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02742.html">Chapter Seven</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">. There are also a variety of weapons that are normally used one-handed but
that can be used two-handed. This would allow a specialist in this style to gain
the speed benefit mentioned above. In addition, the two-handed style specialist
gains a +1 to damage rolls when using a one-handed weapon in two hands.
