The ground’s movement characteristics can have a drastic effect on the course
of a battle. This is referred to as footing.

battlefield.
<P></P>
 The principal effect of poor footing is to limit movement to a fraction of
normal. A character with a normal movement rate of 9 who is in heavy brush is
limited to a MV of 3. The character’s full-move and half-move combat actions are
all affected by this limitation.
