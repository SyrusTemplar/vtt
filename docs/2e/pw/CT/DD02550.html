<P></P>
Here’s a tip for saving time: don’t make a battlefield bigger than it has to
be. There’s no point in mapping every street of a town if you’re confident that
you can contain the battle in one dark alleyway. Refer to the encounter ranges
listed for the various <A HREF="DD02534.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02534.html">terrain types</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> in the previous section; you probably don’t need to make the battlefield
bigger than about 125% to 150% of the maximum encounter range. For example, in
light forest, the encounter range is 4d6 squares. The maximum encounter range is 24
squares, so you’ll want a battlefield about 30 to 35 squares across. If the
encounter is taking place indoors, it’s not necessary to map out more than the
room the PCs are fighting in.
