</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Most hills are considered to be part of another terrain. For example, gentle
rolling hills are plains, forests, or farmlands—their ground cover is their most
important characteristic. This category actually refers to rugged foothills or
highlands with light or no forestation. Large areas of the Appalachian
mountains, the Scottish Highlands, and the foothills of the Alps fall into this
category.
<P></P>
<B>Encounter Range: </B>Determined by the level of forestation (heavy, light, or none.)
<P></P>
<B>Lines of Fire: </B>Determined by the level of forestation.
<P></P>
<B>Cover: </B>Determined by the forestation, but in hills with no trees, hard cover is still
available within 2d10 spaces of any character.
<P></P>
<B>Footing: </B>Characters moving uphill are slowed to 2/3 or 1/3 movement, depending on the
severity of the grade. The forestation may limit movement even if the grade
isn’t too bad. Characters who slip or fall while moving downhill must roll a
successful saving throw vs. death or roll 10–40 feet (1d4x10), suffering 1d4 damage
per 10 feet fallen.
<P></P>
<B>Obstacles: </B>Boulders, escarpments, and ravines or gulches.
<P></P>
<B>Unusual: </B>Characters fighting with a height advantage (i.e., attacking from uphill) gain
a +1 bonus to their attack rolls. Most hills are good places to find rocks for
slingstones.
