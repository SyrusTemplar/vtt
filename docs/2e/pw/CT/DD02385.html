<P></P>
All spells with durations expressed in rounds last for the exact same number
of combat rounds. Spells with durations measured in turns last for the entire
battle. If a spell measured in rounds is in the middle of its duration when the
fighting begins, the balance of its duration runs in combat rounds.

<I> For example, a 5th-level mage casts a haste spell that lasts three rounds,
plus one round per level, for a total of eight rounds. In the fifth round, the
party gets into a fight. The haste spell lasts four combat rounds before expiring.

Everything else about the spell still functions on a round-by-round basis, as
it did before. A cleric casting <I>heat metal </I>still inflicts 2d4 points of searing damage in the third, fourth, and fifth
combat rounds. A wizard with a <I>feather fall </I>spell still falls at a rate of 120 feet per combat round. Remember, this is an
abstract system; applying physics properties to every situation (such as the
fact that the wizard with <I>feather fall </I>is now plummeting to the ground at a hasty 6.8 mph rather than the standard
1.4 mph) may reveal lots of facts, but it won’t make for a better game.
