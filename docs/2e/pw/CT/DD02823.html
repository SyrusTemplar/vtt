<TITLE>An Example of Mass Combat (Combat and Tactics)</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="4">An Example of Mass Combat
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The dwarven leader and bodyguards from the example at the beginning of this
section are talking to a group of six PCs when 40 goblins attack. The 15
bodyguards are 4th-level fighters with battle axe specialization (adjusted THAC0 16),
wearing <I>chain mail +1 </I>and carrying shields (AC 3). The goblins have a THAC0 of 20 and an Armor Class
of 6. They are armed with short swords and short bows.
<P></P>
 The DM decides to divide the combatants into groups of five, so there are
eight groups of goblins and three groups of dwarves. The DM also decides that all
the bodyguards will join the mass combat, leaving the PCs and two groups of
goblins to fight a normal <I>Player’s Option</I> combat system battle. The goblins gain surprise, and loose arrows. The ten
goblins fighting the PCs attack individually. The remaining six groups attack the
bodyguards, two groups of goblins against each group of dwarves.
<P></P>
 The goblins fire two volleys of arrows from 10 yards away. They are at short
range and receive a +1 to their attack rolls because of surprise. Each group of
dwarves receives four volleys of arrows (two groups of goblins each firing two
volleys). Against the first group, the attack rolls are: 3, 17, 18, and 18;
three hits. The first group of dwarves suffers 15 dice of damage; three dwarves
are killed and one suffers three dice of damage. The attack rolls against the
second group are 6, 17, 13, and 20; two hits. The second group suffers 10 dice of
damage, killing two dwarves and inflicting two dice of damage on a third. The
attack rolls against the third group are 3, 19, 4, and 14; one hit. One dwarf is
killed and a second dwarf suffers one die of damage. There are no return
attacks from the PCs and dwarves, because they were surprised.
<P></P>
 The next round, the PCs and the dwarven leader fight a normal battle against
their 10 foes. They make short work of the goblins, killing seven of them.
<P></P>
 In the mass combat, the dwarves are now in the thick of the fight, charging at
the goblins. The dwarves have a +2 bonus for the charge and an additional +1
because they are dwarves attacking goblins. The goblins are still firing their
bows, and loose a volley of arrows as the dwarves charge. They receive a +1
bonus to their attack rolls because their opponents are charging.
<P></P>
 The dwarves complete their charge. Each group of dwarves attacks one group of
goblins, while the remaining three groups are not attacked. Their attack rolls
are 16, 14, and 13; three hits. The first group contains two dwarves who
inflict two dice of damage and kill two goblins. The second group contains three
dwarves, and they kill three goblins. The final group contains four dwarves, who
kill four goblins.
<P></P>
 Each group of dwarves is attacked twice. The rolls against the first group are
3 and 18; one hit. The first group suffers 5 dice of damage; the wounded dwarf
(who had already suffered three dice of damage) is killed and another dwarf is
killed as well, wiping the group out. The rolls against the second group are 5
and 11; both misses. The rolls against the third group are 20 and 14; one hit.
The wounded dwarf is killed and a second dwarf suffers two dice of damage.
<P></P>
 The goblins wisely decide to withhold their second volley of arrows, and the
dwarves get no attacks of opportunity.
<P></P>
 Because there are only six dwarves left, the DM decides a morale check is in
order, and the dwarves pass it. The DM also decides to re-combine the survivors
into a single group of six. The goblin casualties result in 21 goblins
remaining, which the DM divides into three groups of five and one group of six. The DM
also decides that the group of six goblins leaves the mass combat to attack the
PCs and dwarven leader, leaving three groups of goblins in the mass combat.
(There are now nine goblins in the normal combat.)
<P></P>
 During the next round, the PCs continue to do well, slaying seven more
goblins. The two survivors fail a morale check and flee the field.
<P></P>
 In the mass combat, the dwarves get two attacks this round, since they are
specialists. The dwarves first attack roll is a 17, and six HD worth of goblins
would be killed. This is enough to wipe out an entire group of goblins, but the
sixth Hit Die will be wasted. The second attack is made against a second group
of five goblins, and the roll is a 10; still good enough to hit the goblins’
Armor Class of 6. Five more goblins will die, and the last Hit Die goes to waste.
<P></P>
 The three groups of goblins attack, rolling 20, 12, and 4; one hit. The attack
kills two wounded dwarves (who each were two HD down) and wounds another for
one die of damage.
<P></P>
 There are now five goblins facing the six PCs, the dwarven leader, and the
four surviving guards. Finding themselves outnumbered, the goblins check morale
and pass, not wanting to flee from their hated dwarven enemies.
<P></P>
 The DM decides that the remainder of the battle can be handled using the
normal rules, and the mass combat ends. The PCs and dwarves win handily. The 11
fallen dwarves receive magical healing and first aid as soon as the battle ends.
Each rolls a saving throw vs. death to see if they can be revived. The rolls are
incredibly bad, and only four dwarves survive. The PCs also revive one goblin
for interrogation.
<P></P>
