Add the character’s reaction adjustment to his base movement rate. If you are
also playing with the <A HREF="../SP/DD02869.html#18d645e0"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../SP/DD02869.html#18d645e0">Skills &amp; Powers</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> rules, use the adjustment for Dexterity/Balance instead.

 <I>For example, Loftos the Swift, a human fighter, has a Strength of 17 and a
Dexterity of 16. His Strength gives him a hit probability bonus of +1, and his
Dexterity gives him a reaction bonus of +1, too. His base movement rate,
therefore, is 12+1+1, or 14.
