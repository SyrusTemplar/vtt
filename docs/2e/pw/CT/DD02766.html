<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">An unskilled chariot or wagon driver must roll an 8 or less on 1d20 to keep
from flipping over in a dangerous situation. The driver can add his Armor Class
adjustment from Dexterity/Agility to the required number and gets an additional
+1 bonus if he also has the animal handling proficiency. If the driver has the
vehicle handling proficiency, he can make a proficiency check instead of a
driving roll; the +1 bonus for the animal handling proficiency also applies to the
check.
<P></P>
 The vehicle flips over if the check fails. Everyone in the vehicle must roll a
successful saving throw vs. breath weapon or be pinned underneath. A
successful roll indicates that the character is thrown clear. If the vehicle is fully
enclosed by a rigid structure, passengers cannot be pinned under it, but anyone
inside must spend all of the next round climbing out. Passengers in an
open-topped wagon (not a chariot) get a +3 bonus to the roll. If the roll is successful,
the character is considered knocked down and must spend a half-move or attack
action to stand up. A pinned character remains, prone, under the vehicle for
the remainder of the round and must spend all of the next round getting clear.
