</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">About one-half of the area in question is a soft, muddy bog. Bogs are usually
knee-deep to shoulder-deep water, with lots of vegetation, mud, and debris.
Bogs tend to be one large bog, and not many smaller bogs, so mark only one or two
distinct bogs per area of the map. If two adjacent areas have a bog, they might
be one larger bog. Consider connecting them together.
