the character can choose for that combat round. A character’s options are
extremely limited when he is caught in an owlbear’s hug.
<P></P>
 In addition to governing the character’s choice of combat actions for the
round, threatening is also important because it determines who is subject to what
are known as <I>attacks of opportunity </I>(<A HREF="DD02391.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02391.html">see below</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">).
