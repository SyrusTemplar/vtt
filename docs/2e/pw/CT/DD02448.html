When a character or group of monsters fails a morale check, their first
consideration is to get away from the fight. If they fail by a small margin (say, 1
or 2 on the die roll), they try to withdraw in good order. If they fail by a
large margin, they break off the fight and flee for their lives. Intelligent
creatures may try to surrender if there is no place for them to run, or if they
think they won’t be able to get away.
