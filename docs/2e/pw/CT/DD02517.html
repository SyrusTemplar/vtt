Duels don’t have to be fought to the death; in fact, there are lots of
villains and monsters that would rather not get killed if it’s possible to surrender
and live. Some other common conditions for duels include fighting to first
blood, fighting until someone is wounded (usually 25% or 50% loss of hit points),
fighting until disarmed or knocked down, and any number of other alternatives. In
social confrontations, the area’s culture may have dueling traditions that
define the normal forms of combat and victory.

 For example, in Norse cultures, duels might be resolved in a <I>holmgang</I>, or island-going; the two parties involved meet on a small island, with no
seconds or bystanders, and only one is permitted to return. Other duels may be
considered over when the blood of one of the fighters stains a white sheet on
which they fight, or when an impartial judge rules that one character or the other
has been defeated.
