</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Some characters prefer to fight with their fists and feet instead of weapons
and shields. Generally, a character can make one wrestling or overbearing attack
or two punching attacks per round. If a character is using a weapon in one
hand, he can use his second hand for an additional attack, just like fighting in
two-weapon style. However, the bare-handed attack creates an attack of
opportunity for the defender if he threatens the attacker.
<P></P>
 All characters can punch or wrestle; it doesn’t even require a weapon
proficiency. It’s possible to specialize in unarmed combat and become better at
hand-to-hand fighting—refer to <A HREF="DD02674.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02674.html">Chapter Five</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> for more information.
