</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The melee scale is the default scale for battles that take place indoors,
inside dungeons, in darkness or fog, or at close range. As long as the combatants
are all starting within 50 or 60 yards of each other, most battle maps are big
enough to run in melee scale from the start. This will save you the trouble of
converting from missile scale to melee scale during the battle (<A HREF="DD02380.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02380.html">see Missile Scale, below</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">).
<P></P>
 In melee scale, remember that spell and missile ranges are based on yards, not
feet. A thrown dagger normally has a short range of 10 yards, or 30 feet. In
melee scale, this is 6 squares on the battle map. A spell with a 30-yard range
can be targeted 18 squares away.
