<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"><B>Nonproficient:</B> All characters have had some experience with wrestling since early childhood;
the only nonproficient wrestlers are creatures that cannot make wrestling
attacks at all. In most cases, creatures that cannot make wrestling attacks also
cannot be wrestled. If a nonproficient creature can be wrestled, it can make
opposed rolls with no penalties, but it cannot score critical hits or achieve holds
or locks; the creature can merely wiggle out of the attacker’s grasp (or make
natural attacks). A character cannot choose to be nonproficient in wrestling
and gain extra character points under the optional character point system from

<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Familiar: </B>Creatures that can make wrestling attacks are automatically familiar with
wrestling, and need not spend any character points or proficiency slots on the
skill. Such characters can make one wrestling attack each combat round with no
penalty.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Proficient: </B>Any character can spend character points (or a weapon proficiency) to become
proficient at wrestling. Nonwarriors gain no benefit from wrestling proficiency.
Proficient warriors gain their full allotment of melee attacks when wresting.
High-level warriors can initiate multiple wrestling attacks each round and can
try to improve holds or switch locks in any action phase when they are eligible
to make attacks.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Expert: </B>Any character can spend character points (or weapon proficiencies) to become
expert at wrestling. Expert warriors who are entitled to more than one melee
attack each round can make the same number of wrestling attacks each round, but
gain no other benefits. Expert nonwarriors can make multiple wrestling attacks at
the same rate as a nonspecialized warrior of the same level.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Specialized: </B>Generally, only single-classed fighters can become wrestling specialists,
though there are optional rules in the <A HREF="../SP/DD03154.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../SP/DD03154.html">Skills &amp; Powers</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> book that allow other characters to specialize. Wrestling specialists gain
the normal specialist attack and damage bonuses and extra attacks.

<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Master:</B> Only single-classed warriors can attain mastery in wrestling. Wrestling
masters gain the normal master attack and damage bonuses and extra attacks. Grand
master wrestlers can use critical augmentation to score quick locks on attack
rolls of 16 or better.
