Several attack options from <A HREF="DD02479.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02479.html">Chapter Two</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> are also available to unarmed characters, as follows:
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Block: </B>A character can allocate one pummeling attack to block an incoming attack.
Blocks vs. other unarmed attacks are resolved normally. Unarmed blocks against
weapons, including creatures with natural weapons, receive a –4 penalty.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Called Shot:</B> A called shot to an opponent’s head during unarmed combat is a sap attack and
should be resolved according to the rules given in <A HREF="DD02487.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02487.html">Chapter Two</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">. Sapping requires a small, hard object. Bare-handed sapping attacks are
treated as normal pummeling attacks.  Most other called shots made during unarmed
combat should be resolved as special attacks. Attempts to knock items out of
opponents’ hands, for example, should be treated as an offensive disarms.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Disarm:</B> An unarmed character can attempt both offensive and defensive disarms at a –4
penalty to his attack roll if he is eligible to make pummeling attacks. If an
unarmed character attempts to disarm a two-handed weapon the attack penalty is
–8. An unarmed offensive disarm always provokes an attack of opportunity.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Pull/Trip:</B> Most unarmed pull/trip attacks should be resolved as wrestling attacks.   An unarmed pull/trip can be resolved as a pummeling attack if directed at an
opponent who is moving and unaware of the attack. Use the pull/trip rules from <A HREF="DD02486.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02486.html">Chapter Two</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> to resolve this maneuver.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Unhorse:</B> Treat unarmed unhorse attempts as overbearing attacks if the attacker could
conceivably get her body onto the mount while attacking (as might be the case if
the attacker were jumping down on the mounted character from a height);
otherwise, resolve them as wrestling attacks.
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"><SPAN CLASS=Symbol>·</SPAN></FONT> <B>Duels:</B> Two unarmed characters can conduct a duel if they are not involved in a
wrestling sequence (the opposed rolls in a wrestling combat already reflect a
contest of skill). If a successful grapple during any duel results in a hold, the
duel is suspended until the resulting wrestling sequence ends. See Dueling in <A HREF="DD02508.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD02508.html">Chapter Two</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> for procedures.
