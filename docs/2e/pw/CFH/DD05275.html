 We've said before that this whole book consists of optional systems for your
campaign; well, this Hit Locations system can be considered very optional.
<P></P>
    The <I>AD&amp;D®</I> game doesn't encourage a hit locations system, for the reasons given in the<I> Dungeon Master Guide</I>, page 72 (&quot;Injury and Death&quot;).  Some of you still want one, however, so in
this section we're presenting a Hit Locations system that allows you to determine
individual injuries . . . but stays true to the game's philosophy.
