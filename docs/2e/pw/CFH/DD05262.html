 It's possible to use most of the maneuvers described above under ``Melee
Maneuvers'' when fighting barehanded, either Punching, Wrestling, or Martial Arts.
<P></P>
    When a character wishes to perform a maneuver that's not one of the standard
maneuvers for the barehanded fighting style in question, he makes that
announcement at the appropriate time in the combat sequence (that is, if it's a Called
Shot of some sort, he announces before initiative; otherwise, he makes the
announcement when he's called on for the description of his action for the round).
<P></P>
    When his turn comes up, he rolls an attack roll. If he's specialized in a
barehanded fighting style, he still gets the attack bonus for his Specialization.
If he hits, he <I>doesn't </I>do one of the maneuvers from his fighting style; he performs the specific
maneuver he elected. However, if he's a Specialist, he does get the damage bonus
from his fighting style.
<P></P>
    Here are examples of how this works with the specific Melee Maneuvers:
