 Magical armor is repaired in exactly the same way. Base the cost for repairs
on the normal retail value of the armor <I>as if it were not magical</I>.
<P></P>
    When magical armor is damaged, holes may be driven into it, but the basic
enchantment is unchanged. Therefore, the armorer doesn't have to have repair
materials enchanted to &quot;match&quot; the original armor; all he has to do is patch up the
holes and the armor will be fixed. Typically, the armorer will not even know
that he's working on magical armor.
<P></P>
    Of course, as we discuss in the <I>Combat </I>chapter, if a set of magical armor is damaged so severely that the enchantment
is ruined, nothing a normal armorer can do will repair it. Armor that
seriously damaged is ruined even as normal armor; an armorer won't be able to fix it.
