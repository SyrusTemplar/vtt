 As the <I>Introduction </I>notes, use of the Proficiencies section of the AD&amp;D <I>2nd Edition Player's Handbook</I> is <I>not</I> optional with <I>The Complete Fighter's Handbook</I>. The Proficiencies are necessary for you to customize and fine-tune your
character, and for the use of the <I>Warrior Kits</I> chapter of this book.
<P></P>
    Use of the Weapon Proficiencies are pretty much self-evident after you read
the <I>Player's Handbook</I>. Later in this book, though, in the <I>Combat</I> chapter, you'll learn some interesting new things which you can do with
weapon proficiencies.
<P></P>
    Don't forget that high Intelligence scores grant extra proficiencies (equal to
the number of extra languages the character receives for the same score).
<P></P>
    Here, let's talk about three nonweapon proficiencies (Armorer,
Bowyer/Fletcher, and Weaponsmithing) which are of particular use to the warrior
player-character.
