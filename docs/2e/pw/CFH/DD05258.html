<P></P>
 Any character can specialize in one of the three types of unarmed combat
(Punching, Wrestling, and Martial Arts).
<P></P>
    A single-class Warrior can only specialize in one of the three unarmed combat
styles when he is first created. After first level, however, he may specialize
in the other two. He can take specialization in only one style each time he
receives a new Weapon Proficiency, so he could not possibly be a specialist in all
three until he reaches sixth experience level . . . and ninth level is more
likely.
<P></P>
    Usually, the character, if he wants to specialize in more than one style, will
take either Martial Arts or Punching, not both, because their usefulness
overlaps a great deal; and then he'll take Wrestling, because Wrestling is useful
when the character is being grappled.
