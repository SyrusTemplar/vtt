 The one thing your choice of head protection <I>doesn't</I> do is change your Armor Class. A warrior can have on full plate and a great
helm, or full plate and no helmet at all, and he'll have the same AC. So when
making your choice of head protection for your character, don't worry about the
character's AC, for it won't be affected.
