<P></P>
 This is an option that is only available to single-class Warriors (and to
Fighting-Monks from <I>The Complete Priest's Handbook</I>).
<P></P>
    If the warrior continues to devote Weapon Proficiency slots to an unarmed
combat style <I>after he is already specializing in it</I>, he gets the following benefits. Note: The character may not take more than
basic Specialization in any of the arts at first experience level; thus, at
first level, he may devote one slot to Punching, or one slot to Wrestling, or two
slots to Martial Arts, but not more than that to any of them. At third level,
when he receives another slot, he may devote it then to improve his
Specialization.
<P></P>
    For each additional slot devoted to his art:
<P></P>
    He gains a +1 bonus to all his attack rolls with his combat style;
<P></P>
    He gains a +1 bonus to all damage with his combat style; and
<P></P>
    He gains a +1 chart bonus with all attacks in that combat style. With chart
bonuses of +2 or more, the character can choose any maneuver within the range of
maneuvers covered by his chart bonus (see the example below).
<P></P>
    <I>Example: Cassius the Gladiator is a Punching Specialist. He Specialized in
Punching at first level, put another Weapon Proficiency slot into it at third
level, another at sixth, and still another at ninth.
<P></P>
    At ninth level, he has a +3 bonus to attack rolls with Punching, a +3 to
damage rolls with Punching, and a +3 chart bonus.
<P></P>
    Let's say he rolls a 16 to hit someone, and that the attack does hit. This
would normally be a Glancing Blow. But he has a +3 chart bonus. He can choose for
the maneuver, instead of just being a rolled result of 16, to be anywhere from
19 to 13. He can choose for the maneuver to be a Wild Swing, a Rabbit Punch, a
Kidney Punch, a Glancing Blow (as rolled), a Jab, an Uppercut, or a Hook.
<P></P>
    Of these seven maneuvers, Jab and Hook do the most damage, and Hook has a
slightly higher chance of knockout success, so he chooses it. With his punch, he
will do a basic 2 points for the maneuver, +3 points from the damage bonus he
gets for specializing, and any bonus his Strength gives him.</I>
