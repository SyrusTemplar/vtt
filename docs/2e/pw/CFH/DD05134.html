 In general, each Kit can be used with each of the three warrior classes. Your
character can, for instance, be a Barbarian Fighter, an Amazon Paladin, or a
Samurai Ranger.
<P></P>
    Some choices may be a little questionable. For example, it's not likely that
you'll be playing a Pirate Paladin. However, it <I>is </I>possible. If your band of pirates, in happy-go-lucky movie tradition, attacks
only the wicked, frees all innocents, and performs in an otherwise
mostly-honorable fashion, they're obviously not an evil group and a paladin could adventure
among them. If that's the sort of pirate campaign you and your DM agree to
play, then that's fine.
<P></P>
    When one warrior class cannot choose a specific Warrior Kit, the exceptions
will be noted.
