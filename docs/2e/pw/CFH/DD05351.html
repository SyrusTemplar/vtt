 Armor found as treasure has a chance to be <I>high-quality</I> armor. Ordinary armor has a 10% chance on percentile dice; magical armor has
a 25% chance.
<P></P>
    Each race adds something different to its armor if it is high-quality.
<P></P>
    <B>Dwarves:</B> High-Quality dwarvish armor is very, very resistant to damage. Whenever
High-Quality dwarvish armor must make a saving throw (see the <I>Dungeon Master Guide,</I> page 39<I>.</I>), it gets a +6 to save in addition to any bonuses it receives if it is
magical. Additionally, if you use the &quot;Damage to Armor&quot; rules described later in this
chapter, all High-Quality dwarvish armor has twice the number of damage points
of ordinary armor.
<P></P>
    <B>Elves:</B> High-Quality elvish armor is one- half the weight of ordinary armor; it
constitutes &quot;elven steel&quot; (see the chart on page 38 of the <I>Dungeon Master Guide</I>).
<P></P>
    <B>Gnomes:</B> Gnomes make very quiet studded and padded leather armors; these are the only
High-Quality armors they make. High-Quality gnome armor does not take any
penalties on the &quot;Thieving Skill Armor Adjustment&quot; table (<I>Player's Handbook</I>, page 39, last column); thus, a gnome thief or dual-class thief does not
suffer a –30% when picking pockets, or a –20% when moving silently, etc.
<P></P>
    <B>Half-Elves:</B> Half-Elf armorers do not make any High-Quality leather armor, padded armor,
studded leather, hide armor, or bronze plate mail. All their other armors can be
made as High-Quality armor. High-Quality half-elf armor is made from fine
steel; it is –10% the weight of ordinary armor of the same kind, fine steel, for
normal thickness, –10% weight, and gets a +2 to saving throws (on the &quot;Metal&quot;
column on page 39 of the <I>Dungeon Master Guide</I>).
<P></P>
    <B>Halflings:</B> Halflings only make leather armor as High-Quality armor. Their High-Quality
leather armor counts as &quot;No Armor&quot; on the Thieving Skill Armor Adjustment table (<I>Player's Handbook</I>, page 39).
<P></P>
    <B>Humans:</B> Humans make all types of armor as High-Quality armor. This is especially
tough armor; whatever it is made of, it is +2 to saving throws on the appropriate
line of the &quot;Item Saving Throws&quot; chart on page 39 of the <I>Dungeon Master Guide</I>. Also, plate mail (not including bronze plate), field plate, and full plate
made to High-Quality specifications is made of fine steel, but instead of being
lighter than usual, it is built thicker in order to make it more resistant to
damage. It is +4 to saving throws on that &quot;Item Saving Throws&quot; chart, and is
normal weight. Also, it gives the wearer a +2 to saving throws vs. Rod, Staff, or
Wand and Breath Weapon attacks. In addition, if you are using the &quot;Damage to
Armor&quot; rules found later in this chapter, it has one and a half times the normal
damage points for the type of armor it is.

<P></P>
 All the above descriptions were for worn armor, not shields. High-Quality
shields do not impart any special bonus unless you're using the &quot;Damage to Armor&quot;
rules, in which case they have twice as many damage points as the normal sort of
shield.
<P></P>
    How much does it cost to buy a set of High-Quality racial armor? First, the DM
has to decide whether there is any available to sell. Usually, the answer will
be no; there is only a 1% chance that a normal village armorer's will have
made <I>any</I> piece of high-quality armor to sell, and that will be racial armor of the
armorer's race. The chance goes up to 5% in a big city, or 25% if you're looking
for racial armor of the race that is most common in the city. Thus, to find
high-quality dwarvish armor, go to a big dwarf community . . . and there your
chances are still low.
<P></P>
    But if you find what you're looking for, or are able to hire an armorer to
build you a set, it costs ten times the normal cost of the armor. High-quality
dwarf plate mail, then, would cost 6,000 gp. Often, it's not worth the price to
the adventurer.
<P></P>
    In <I>no</I> case will an elvish craftsman custom-make a set of High-Quality elvish armor
for someone. Such armor is only made for the elvish royalty, and their kings
sometimes bestow a piece on a non-elf hero . . . but only for deeds of
exceptional valor which have helped the elves.
<P></P>
    Another question adventurers are sure to ask: Can an armorer of one race build
his own type of High-Quality armor for another race? For example, can a master
gnome armorer build High-Quality gnome armor for a human?
<P></P>
    The answer is yes. Instead of costing ten times the normal cost of the armor,
the price is 15 times the normal cost. But it can be done. Again, though, an
elf armorer will never make High-Quality armorer for anyone but his rulers.
<P></P>
    Custom-built High-Quality armor takes four times as long to make as normal,
average armor.
