<P></P>
 The DM can, and should, modify the Kits presented above to represent his own
campaign setting more accurately.
<P></P>
    For example, if there are no Amazons in his world, he should disallow the
Amazon Kit. If Gladiators are all chosen from the ranks of savages despised in the
civilized land, he should modify the Gladiator hindrances to reflect the fact
that they have no respect in the campaign setting.
