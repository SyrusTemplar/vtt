 When things are really dark, characters have a hard time finding and attacking
their foes . . . and defending against their enemies' attacks.
<P></P>
    Characters and monsters don't start suffering penalties in darkness until it's
very dark indeed. When it becomes very dark, they suffer penalties to hit
their enemies. And if their enemies can see better than they can, their enemies get
bonuses to attack rolls.

<P></P>
    On the chart above, you'll see all those same Visibility Ranges in the first
column.
<P></P>
    The second column indicates the character's attack penalty when he's attacking
someone in melee combat in that sort of visibility.
<P></P>
    The third column lists the penalties for shooting at someone in ranged combat
in those visibility conditions. This penalty is taken once at Short Range,
again at Medium Range, and once more at Long Range (see <A HREF="../PHB/DD01625.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01625.html">Table 45</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> on page 69 of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>).
<P></P>
    The fourth column is the Infravision Bonus. If a character has Infravision,
his bonus is applied against his attack penalty for Melee, and against his attack
penalty for Missile attacks suffered at each range step.
<P></P>

<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>How This Works</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>

<P></P>
 When a character is in a situation where he suffers a penalty to attack rolls
in melee combat, he's obviously in some dark area. He, and everyone else with
similar vision, suffers the penalties to attack rolls in melee and missile
combat.
<P></P>
    <I>Example: Rathnar is in a fight in pea-soup fog. He can barely see his hand in
front of his face. An enemy looms up in the fog. Rathnar strikes at it—but
suffers a –3 to attack rolls. The fog is so thick that it's difficult to strike
exactly the right place. He rolls an attack that would barely have hit his foe in
ordinary circumstances; in these circumstances, his blow is a clean miss.
<P></P>
</I>    The missile penalty gets worse and worse the further away the attacker is from
his target.
<P></P>
    <I>Example: Sir Amstard, at the head of an army, is firing at the oncoming army
of orcs, which is half-way across the plain. The orcs are at 200 yards, barely
in range of the heroes' long bows. The weather, however, is drizzly and rainy,
considered to be Mist on the chart above.
<P></P>
    The chart says that Amstard and allies take a –1 to attack rolls—at each range
step. That's –1 at short range, another –1 at medium, and a last –1 at long
range. Amstard and friends take a –3 to attack rolls when firing at the orcs.
<P></P>
    Suddenly, the cloud breaks and a heavy rain falls on everyone. The DM rules
that it's the equivalent of light fog or snow. The orcs haven't yet gotten within
140 yards, so they're still at long range. Amstard and friends fire again.
Now, they're at –2 to attack rolls per range step, or –6 total to attack rolls
their enemies.
<P></P>
</I>
<P></P>

<P></P>
(The Simple Way)
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
 The simplest way to use Infravision in these circumstances is to ignore that
fourth column on the chart above and just say that Infravision cancels out all
darkness penalties. This is simple, easy to remember, and doesn't cause any
combat hassles.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>How Infravision Works
<P></P>
(The Complex Way)
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
 If you prefer more realism and complexity, then Infravision is a help, but
it's still not quite as good as being in broad daylight.
<P></P>
    With these optional rules, Infravision can be a big help in times of darkness.
A character with Infravision isn't as disadvantaged by poor lighting
conditions.
<P></P>
    First, in melee combat, in any condition of darkness where one person has
better vision than the other, he gets a bonus to attack rolls. This bonus is equal
to the other fellow's attack penalty. (The character with infravision is still
subject to the normal penalty—in effect, this bonus cancels the character's own
penalty.)
<P></P>
   <I> Example: It's dark and moonless outside, and Rathnar is fighting Aspendale the
Elf. Rathnar doesn't have Infravision; Aspendale does. Rathnar, because it's
dark and moonless, is taking a –3 penalty to attack rolls Aspendale in melee.
Aspendale, therefore, has a +3 when striking at Rathnar. (–3 for bad lighting, +3
for Rathnar's handicap, +3 for infravision bonus).
<P></P>
</I>    Second, in missile combat, in similar conditions, the character with the
better vision gets a bonus to hit his target. This, also, is equal to the other
fellow's <I>melee</I>, not missile, penalty to attack rolls.
<P></P>
    <I>Example: Taking a beating, Rathnar runs off into the darkness and gets to his
bow. Aspendale accommodates him. Firing at Medium Range, Rathnar is at a –12 to
attack rolls! That's –6 each at Short and Medium ranges, according to the
chart above.</I>
<P></P>
    Third, the third column of the chart above gives a bonus for Infravision. This
is applied to the character's penalty for melee combat, and to his penalty for
missile combat at each range step.
<P></P>
   <I>Example: Aspendale returns fire. He would be at a –6 per each range step, too,
but he has Infravision. He gets a –6 at Short and at Medium Range, but that's
offset by a +3 at Short and a +3 at Medium Range. His penalty: –6. And because
he can see better in the dark than Rathnar anyway, he gets a bonus equal to
Rathnar's melee penalty: +3. His final penalty: A mere –3. He shoots back at
Rathnar, hitting him clean on.
