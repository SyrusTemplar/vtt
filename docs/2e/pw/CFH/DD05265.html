 It's possible for a barehanded fighter to disarm an armed opponent, but it's
dangerous. When so trying, the barehanded fighter's AC suffers a penalty of 2
(for example, a 5 becomes a 7; he's having to expose himself to attack briefly),
and his Disarm attempt is at an additional –4 to attack rolls. But if it hits,
it's just as successful as any other Disarm.
