 And it does cost money to craft armor. The cost is:
<P></P>
 (a) About half the &quot;retail value&quot; of the armor piece for materials; plus
<P></P>
  (b) The cost of maintaining one or two apprentices during the time it takes to
make the piece; plus
<P></P>
    (c) Additional cost based on how much of the overseer's time and attention the
project takes. (The project may take one or two overseers full-time on the
project, may take only <I>half </I>one overseer's time on the project, or may take none of the overseer's
time—the latter constitute projects that the apprentices can do all by themselves,
mostly unsupervised.)
<P></P>
    The previous table shows standard costs to manufacture armor.
<P></P>
    In usual circumstances, the difference between the Total Cost and the Retail
Value is the shop's profit when it sells a piece of armor.
<P></P>
    As you can see from the table, hide armor, leather armor, padded armor, medium
shields and small shields are little-to-no-profit propositions. However, they
keep the apprentices paid and keep work in the shop.

<P></P>
 Now, the costs given above are not the final word on how much it costs to make
armor. With your DM's permission, you can skew these numbers around (both up
and down) through the following means.
<P></P>
    First, you can put extra men on a job. (Important Note: If overseers are
drafted to do apprentice-level work, one overseer counts as two apprentices.) You
can only put extra men on a job in increments of the original number of men
required for the job: In other words, if the job required two apprentices, you don't
see an improvement in speed until you assign two <I>more</I> apprentices to the job. At that point, you cut the speed of the job in half.
<P></P>
    <I>Example: From the chart, you see it takes one apprentice with no overseer ten
weeks to work up a set of chain mail. That's a standard in the armorer's
industry; they'll always tell you it takes ten weeks to work up a chain mail hauberk.
But in an emergency situation, they could put an extra apprentice on the job
(either have two working on it at once, or have one on the &quot;day shift&quot; and one
on the &quot;night shift&quot;). With twice the available manpower, it would only take
half the time, or five weeks, to create the chain mail.
<P></P>
</I>    Second, if the Overseer is a player-character, he doesn't have to pay himself
as much. This is usually the case with armorers when they first go into
business for themselves: They pay the cost for materials and the cost for their
apprentices, and whatever they have left over is their own salary, even if it is much
less than the 15 gp/week standard mentioned above. (That number, 15 gp/week,
represents a firm lower-middle-class standard of living; an armorer who earns
less will be living at a lower-class standard of living.)
<P></P>
    With that in mind, we can re-interpret some of the numbers above. Let's say
that we have one player-character armorer who wants to work up a set of hide
armor.
<P></P>
    Hide armor normally takes up half the work-day of one apprentice for eight
weeks. It costs 7 gp in materials, and he can sell it on the usual market for 15
gp. If just the chief armorer, who counts as an Overseer if his Armorer ability
check is 12 or better, works on this item alone, it will take him only two
weeks to make the hide armor (remember, an Overseer counts as two apprentices;
therefore, he's putting four times the manpower on the task as it customarily
requires, thus cutting the time required to one-fourth, or two weeks). If he can
sell it for 15 gp, he's made 8 gp. He's earning a meager 4 gp a week, which is
better than a poverty-level wage, but less than middle-class.
