 Often, a PC Armorer who is also an adventurer will set up an armorer's shop
and crew it with a single overseer and two apprentices. This shop's duty will be
to keep the PC supplied in armor; also, whenever the PC returns home, he can,
if he wishes, operate the shop, especially in the &quot;off-shift&quot; (whichever shift
the regular crew is not operating it).
<P></P>
   If he does hire an overseer, he'll have to pay the rates according to the
overseer's ability, as described above.
<P></P>

 Note that a PC Armorer can make armor for his friends. He can't avoid paying
the minimum cost for the materials, of course. The character can carry a tent
and leatherworker's shop on the back of a horse, so he can work on any sort of
all-leather or padding armor while on the road. But on the road, he can only get
in a couple of hours' work per day, so multiply all armor-making times by four
to determine how long they take.
<P></P>
    The character who does all this extra work will be a little more tired than
his fellows; reduce his Intelligence ability check to spot upcoming dangers.
