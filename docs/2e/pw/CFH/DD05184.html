 If it's a &quot;good guy&quot; campaign, the player-characters are heroes . . . but
misunderstood.
<P></P>
    They may have been framed for crimes they did not commit, and were forced to
flee the authorities (it's hard to prove your innocence when you're swinging
from a gibbet). They may be enemies of the new ruling power (if a wise old ruler
dies and is replaced by an oppressive and unfair new ruler, that's ample
justification to embark on a life of outlawry . . . in the game and the movies,
anyway).
<P></P>
    In such a campaign, the characters are wanted by the law, but it's the law
that's wrong, and the heroes treat their captives and victims with golden-rule
ethics.
<P></P>
    In other words, they'll capture innocents and take their money and goods . . .
but they'll offer no insult to victims who deserve none, will tend to release
such prisoners unharmed. Inevitably, some of these former prisoners will be
re-introduced in the story in an upper-hand position, and may be able or willing
to help the unlawful heroes when they're in a bad position.
<P></P>
    On the other hand, victims who are their true enemies (wicked representatives
of the evil rulers, personal enemies, tax collectors, competing pirates and
outlaws with no scruples, and self-centered money-grubbers of any sort) tend to be
humiliated and embarrassed while they are prisoners of the PCs. Unless they
behave very stupidly and attack the PCs, they, too, are likely to be released
unharmed; if they do attack, they tend to be battled in single combat, and usually
are killed. Enemy prisoners, if released, also tend to reappear in the story
down the line . . . usually at a time when they can do a lot of harm to the
player-characters.
<P></P>
    The main goal of this sort of campaign is restoring the old status quo. If the
characters used to be law-abiding citizens and are now wanted by the law for
the wrong reasons, their eventual goal is to prove their innocence. If the land
used to be ruled by a wise ruler who is now imprisoned or dead, the characters'
goal is to release him from prison or find and crown his wise true heir.
<P></P>
    Often, the heroes' force of men (pirate ship or outlaw band) will prove useful
to someone in a position of power (like the rescued ruler or another powerful
noble), and that personage will issue them pardons and commissions into his
army or navy just before the slam-bang climax of the campaign or mini-series.
