<P></P>
 When a character who has sustained both Normal and Temporary damage receives
magical healing, the healing spell <I>first</I> heals the Normal (real) Damage. If it heals all the Normal Damage, it then
goes to work on the Temporary Damage.
<P></P>
    <I>Example: Let us say Amstard receives a cure light wounds spell immediately
after being knocked out. The priest rolls a 6 on 1d8. The first three points of
healing cure his three points of Normal Damage. The remaining three are applied
to his Temporary Damage. When that's all done, Amstard is down 0 points of
Normal Damage and 8 points of Temporary Damage.</I>
