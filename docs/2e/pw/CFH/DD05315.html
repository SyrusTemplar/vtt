 Some characters chase after every group of enemies who run away from combat,
with the avowed intention of running them down and killing them.
<P></P>
    The best way to counter this attitude, and persuade the PCs to let the
occasional band of inconsequential NPCs and monsters escape, is to have such enemies
set up traps along their escape route. If the PCs pursue, they get caught in the
traps and suffer damage and embarrassment. That will teach them to be more
cautious in future events.
<P></P>
    Once the characters see enemies getting away, they may come to the realization
that they may themselves occasionally flee and get away.
