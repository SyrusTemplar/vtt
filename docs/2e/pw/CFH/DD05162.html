 <B>Character Description:</B> This hero has been afflicted with a curse or a prophecy that haunts him
throughout his life. He may have lost his One True Love and been fated never to find
her. He may be doomed to bring misfortune on anyone he cares about. He might
be prophesied to die whenever certain campaign-related goals are achieved. He
might be the last survivor of his race, doomed to die without issue, so that the
race dies with him. When he's not fighting for his goals, this character is
suffering. For this reason, you shouldn't play such a character unless you <I>enjoy</I> portraying that suffering. If you choose such a character type, you must
consult with your DM to determine just what sort of curse afflicts the
character—it's absolutely pointless to play a Doomed Champion unless there actually is a
doom or curse at work.
<P></P>
    <B>Best Suited For:</B> Any alignment is appropriate for the Doomed Champion. In terms of Warrior
Kits, most are appropriate, except for the essentially cheery Swashbuckler.
<P></P>
    <B>In Combat Situations:</B> The Doomed Champion tends to fight in an all-out, desperate-strength manner.
He throws himself fully into a fight and seeks out the most dangerous
opponents. Either he's simply desperate to achieve his ends and elude his curse, or he's
unconsciously seeking his own death. He's therefore not good as a team
tactician. On the other hand, his bravery is inspirational to other heroes and
followers, so he's often made the leader of war parties. He can be merciful in combat,
or kill all who face him (all the while regretting the grim necessity of it).
<P></P>
    <B>In Role-Playing Situations:</B> The Doomed Champion tends to be sympathetic to others' needs and pains . . .
but is himself very depressive, because he knows that some grim fate awaits
him. This means he's often easy to persuade to aid in others' quests (not quests
for money: quests for more personal goals).
