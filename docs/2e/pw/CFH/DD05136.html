<P></P>
 Following are several sorts of warriors represented by Warrior Kits. Before
allowing his players to choose Kits for their characters, the DM should review
these and make notes for himself about them.
<P></P>
    For each Warrior Kit, the DM has to choose:
<P></P>
    (1) If he will even allow this Kit in his campaign.
<P></P>
    (2) What additional information he needs to give the players about each Kit.
<P></P>
    (3) What changes he might wish to make to each Kit.
<P></P>
    Let's take the Amazon Kit as an example. This Kit was loosely derived from the
Amazons of Greek myth. But this DM's Amazons may be substantially different
from those.
<P></P>
    So, first, he has to decide if he will allow this Kit in his campaign. If he
has any sort of Amazons on his world, he probably will allow this. If he has no
Amazons, then he won't. Let's presume that he does.
<P></P>
    Second, he has to decide what additional information he needs to give the
players about the Amazons. In his world, let's say, the Amazons live on Lunyrra, a
heavily forested island surrounded by almost unscaleable cliffs, and make war
on the surrounding islands; when players are interested in playing Amazons, he
gives them that information in addition to the Kit.
<P></P>
    Third, he has to decide what changes he wishes to make to the Kit. Since his
Amazons are sailors instead of famous equestrians, he changes the required/bonus
Nonweapon Proficiencies from Riding and Animal Training to Seamanship and
Navigation.
<P></P>
    By these means, he has adapted the generic Warrior Kit below to his own
campaign world and made it fit in just as he likes.
