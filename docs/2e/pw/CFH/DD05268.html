 A barehanded fighter trying to parry a barehanded attack does so at normal
odds.
<P></P>
    As with Disarm, it's possible, but dangerous, for a barehanded fighter to
parry an attack from a melee weapon. The Parrying character must suffer an AC
penalty of 2 (for the same reasons described under Disarm, immediately above), and
his AC stays disadvantaged until his next attack comes up. Then, when performing
the Parry (which usually consists of getting so close to the enemy that the
Parrying character can get his own hand under the descending weapon-hand), the
Parrying character suffers an additional –2 to attack rolls.
