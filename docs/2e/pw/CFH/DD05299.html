 If a character takes Weapon Specialization in lance, he gets the usual
benefits of attack and damage bonuses. But he also gets the following benefits:
<P></P>
    He can perform the Shield-Rush maneuver with his lance-tip. In order for this
to do damage like a Shield-Rush instead of a lance strike the character must be
mounted, and must strike a character who has metal (or leather-and-metal)
armor or a shield. If the character does not have such armor, the attack is
automatically a lance strike.
<P></P>
    He gets a +2 bonus to AC (thus, an AC 2 would become a 0), only when jousting
and only vs. another jouster. (That is, the AC bonus is only against incoming
lance attacks, and only works when the defender is himself mounted and carrying
a lance.)
