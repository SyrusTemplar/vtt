 <B>Character Description:</B> This character is a hero with an attitude problem. He's grim and humorless,
and never fights just to give someone a drubbing—he fights to kill. He's driven
by some powerful, unsympathetic motivation: A desire for revenge, overwhelming
desire for a possession, or even a near-psychotic desire just to be left alone.
He must be carefully played so that there actually <I>is</I> a reason for him to accompany the other player-characters, and the DM may
need to remind his player occasionally that he <I>can</I> have friends and loyalties, even if he prefers to conceal that fact behind
hard-bitten mannerisms and an evil temper. Naturally, this personality type has
few or no romantic inclinations or relationships.
<P></P>
    <B>Best Suited For:</B> In terms of alignment, the Dangerous Antagonist is appropriate for all of
them. Different alignments result in different motivations: A Lawful/Good
Dangerous Antagonist has been embittered by events in his life, while a Chaotic/Evil
character is a sociopath. In terms of Warrior Kits, most are appropriate; the
usual exceptions are the Cavalier and Swashbuckler, who tend to be better-tempered
characters.
<P></P>
    <B>In Combat Situations:</B> The Dangerous Antagonist fights in a smart and deadly fashion (unless he's a
Berserker). He prefers a &quot;Take no prisoners!&quot; attitude, but can allow himself
to be overruled by his friends, especially if they can persuade him that there's
a practical reason for it (just being merciful and humane isn't good enough).
He can be a good combat tactician for the team, directing his allies to fight
in the most deadly and efficient manner possible; or, he could be a
wade-right-in fighter who vents his hatred on his enemies.
<P></P>
    <B>In Role-Playing Situations:</B> This character generally doesn't do role-playing negotiations with NPCs,
unless the PCs are attempting to intimidate or frighten the NPCs. The Dangerous
Antagonist must be played carefully; many Dangerous Antagonist characters are
merely kill-crazy fighters with overinflated opinions of themselves, and so it's
very easy when playing such a character to aggravate the other players with his
pretentiousness. In other words: Be menacing, but concentrate that menace more
on NPCs than your PC allies.
