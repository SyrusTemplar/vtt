<P></P>
 Though everyone has a certain knowledge of punching and wrestling, so that
everyone can be considered to have a &quot;weapon proficiency&quot; you can now Specialize
in either of the two techniques.
<P></P>
    To Specialize, you must devote a weapon proficiency slot to the technique. Any
character of any class can Specialize in Punching or Wrestling (or Martial
Arts, described later) . . . but except for the Fighting-Monk (described in <I>The Complete Priest's Handbook</I>, no character other than a single-class Warrior can ever specialize in more
than one of these techniques. A single-class Warrior can end up specializing in
both, but may begin play specializing in only one of them.
<P></P>
    Specialization does not count as a Weapon Specialization. A first-level
fighter could specialize in both Long Sword and Punching if he wished to. A Rogue,
who cannot take any Weapon Specialization, can still take <I>one</I> unarmed fighting style specialization.
<P></P>
    Fighting style specializations (i.e., Single-Weapon, Two-Hander, etc.) do not
grant any bonuses to Punching, Wrestling, or Martial Arts combat. They're of
use only to combat with melee weapons.
