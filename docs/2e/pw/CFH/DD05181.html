 This is a campaign of knights and chivalric doings. Some of the characters are
traditional medieval knights, some are their squires; others may be warriors
or mercenaries accompanying their party, or other types of characters being
escorted by them (noblemen and noblewomen, priests, etc.).
<P></P>
 This type of campaign differs greatly from the Cavaliers campaign in that the
Noble Warriors don't have to be staunch supporters of goodness and light. Some
will be true heroes; some will be self-centered boors. But they share the
common ties of knighthood and nobility, so they <I>usually</I> get along with one another.
<P></P>
    For an idea of what sorts of adventures are appropriate to a Noble Warriors
campaign, you need only read the books and see the movies, available in the
hundreds or thousands, appropriate to such characters. In particular, the novels of
Sir Walter Scott and the chronicles of the doings of Camelot are very
appropriate source material (and, no, <I>not</I> all the knights of Camelot were Cavaliers; some were brutes).
<P></P>
    In Noble Warriors campaigns, the heroes wander the land righting wrongs by
sword or lance; they fight dragons which lair in menacing caverns in the deepest
woods; they defend the land against infidels and invaders; they compete with one
another in friendly tournaments and unfriendly clashes between rival kings or
barons; and they raise and lead great armies on overseas crusades.
<P></P>
 They also defend the prerogatives of their class. For instance, in a Cavaliers
campaign, the PC heroes might join a peasant's rebellion against the land's
rightful (but greedy and abusive) rulers, and even completely overthrow that
land's system of rulership. In a Noble Warriors campaign, the PCs will instead help
put down the rebellion . . . and then the good ones among them will
investigate the cause of the rebellion, and perhaps depose the evil lords on their own.
At that point, they'd elevate the next person in line for the throne or
lordship—as long as he was a noble enough character.
<P></P>
 In Noble Warrior campaigns, if the PCs all agree to it, they can all be
unchivalric boors. Perhaps they all prefer to be robber-barons and ill-tempered
knights. If that's the case, and the DM has no problem with it, that's fine.
