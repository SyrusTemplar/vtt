 As it mentions in the <I>DMG</I>, again under &quot;<A HREF="../DMG/DD00420.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../DMG/DD00420.html">Hitting a Specific Target</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">,&quot; the normal <I>AD&amp;D®</I> game is not geared toward a hit-location system which chronicles where every
blow lands and which body parts get injured. We'll be presenting some options
for that sort of thing later in this chapter, but this section concerns
something slightly different.
<P></P>
    Monsters often have body parts or features with extraordinary or magical
effects; examples include the eyes of the beholder, tentacles of the carrion
crawler, individual heads of the chimera, and so on. Many animated statues are
motivated by a medallion, inscription, or imbedded gem.
<P></P>
    A hero can take a called shot to attack those very specialized locations; this
is a very heroic thing to do. It's up to the DM to determine how much damage
such body parts can take; some will take as little as 1 point of damage before
being destroyed, while others may be expressed in fractions of the creature's
normal hit point total.
