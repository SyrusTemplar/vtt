 The Disarm is a specific variation on Called Shots. With the Disarm, the
attacker takes a Called Shot at the weapon his target is currently using.

 With the basic Disarm maneuver, the attacker follows the normal rules for
Called Shots (announcing his intention before initiative and receiving a +1
modifier to initiative, and then suffering a –4 attack penalty); if his attack is
successful, he will (normally) cause his enemy's weapon to go flying from his
enemy's hand.
<P></P>
    Roll 2d6. The number rolled is the number of feet the weapon flies. Roll 1d6.
The number rolled determines which direction the weapon goes. (This is
described in terms of the attacker's facing. Straight Ahead means straight ahead from
the attacker; Behind means behind the attacker.
<P></P>

<P></P>
    1 = Straight Ahead
<P></P>
    2 = Ahead, Right
<P></P>
   3 = Behind, Right
<P></P>
    4 = Straight Behind
<P></P>
    5 = Behind, Left
<P></P>
    6 = Ahead, Left
<P></P>

<P></P>
    This Disarm can also be used on magic wands, crystal balls, and any other sort
of magical apparatus which is held in one hand. If the item is worn (like
jewelry), it cannot be Disarmed. (Note: Weapons, when used, cannot be worn like
jewelry.)

Disarm vs. Two-Handed Weapons</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>

<P></P>
 Disarm does not work nearly so well against two-handed weapons. If you perform
a Disarm against a wielder of a two-handed weapon (including magical staves),
it merely knocks the weapon out of alignment briefly; the weapon's wielder
automatically loses initiative on the next round. However, two Disarms made against
the wielder<I> in the</I> <I>same round</I> will knock the weapon free; roll only 1d6 to see how many feet it flies, and
1d6 to see which direction it goes.
<P></P>
    Naturally, the two Disarm maneuvers don't have to come from the same
character. Two characters can work together to disarm the two-handed wielder; or, one
character with multiple attacks in a round can do the job himself.
<P></P>
    If a character finds his two-handed weapon partially disarmed, and he still
has at least one attack to perform this round, he can elect to forget about his
next attack and may use that attack to recover his weapon instead.
<P></P>
    <I>Example: Torreth and Amstard are fighting, Torreth with long sword and shield,
Amstard with two-handed sword. Both characters have two attacks per round.
Torreth has initiative. He successfully Disarms Amstard, drawing his weapon out of
line. Amstard now has his first attack of the round. He can either punch
Torreth with his gauntleted fist, in which case his sword will still be out of line,
or he can recover from the Disarm. He chooses to recover. He swings the weapon
back into line and is ready for the next exchange. He suffers no initiative
penalty on the next turn.
<P></P>

<P></P>

<P></P>
 Disarm is only of partial usefulness when struck against a shield. It won't
tear the shield loose from the wielder's arm. However, it will draw it out (knock
it out of alignment, so that the wielder is not protected by it). For the rest
of the round, the shield-wielder loses the AC bonus of the shield (and any
magical benefits, too). At the start of the next combat round, even before
initiative is rolled, the character regains his shield's AC bonus.
<P></P>
    If a shield has other properties, those stay in effect, even when the shield
is Disarmed out of alignment. For example, let's say a shield radiates a <I>protection from evil</I> spell. If it's Disarmed, and drawn out of alignment, its wielder still gets
the benefits of that <I>protection from evil</I> spell. Only when he drops the shield or has it forcibly wrested away from him
does he lose that benefit.
<P></P>
    As with the Disarming of two-handed weapons, if a character finds his shield
disarmed, and he still has at least one attack to perform this round, he can
elect to forget about his next attack and may use that attack to recover his
weapon instead.
<P></P>
    <I>Example: At the start of the next round, Amstard's ally Jeter, carrying a
halberd, joins the fight. Torreth wins initiative again. He takes an ordinary
strike at Amstard and misses. Jeter chooses to Disarm Torreth's shield +4. He
successfully Disarms it. Now, Amstard takes his shot, his chances greatly improved
because Torreth's shield bonus to AC doesn't come into play. He smites Torreth
with a mighty blow. Torreth has another attack this round: Realizing that he's
going to get hurt if he doesn't have his shield up, he forgets about a second
attack and uses that time to bring his shield back up.
