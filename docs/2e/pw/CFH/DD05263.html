 A Puncher or Martial Artist can perform Called Shots, but none will do any
extra damage. They can be very effective in combat in very specific situations if
the character is trying to perform one of the standard Called Shots: Striking a
Specific Body Part (as mentioned earlier, to damage a beholder's special eye,
for example), Smashing Something Being Held (though the attacker risks having
the contents of whatever he's smashing spilled on him), and Bypassing Armor
(again, this only works on monsters where the DM has designed a specific weakness
into the monster).
<P></P>
    A Puncher or Martial Artist can also perform a Called Shot to attack a
specific Hit Location. See the text on &quot;Hit Locations,&quot; below. This is the sort of
attack the character wants to use if he's trying to hit an enemy in the jaw to
knock him out, pound him in the solar plexus to double him over, and so on; all
normal rules for Hit Locations are used.
