 Moreover, let's look realistically at weapon proficiency. Currently, if a
character has Weapon Proficiency with Dagger/Dirk, he doesn't have it with Knife.
He certainly doesn't have it with Short Sword. Of course, the DM can always
decide that such weapons are related to one another. If he does, then the warrior
would suffer a –1 to attack rolls with the unknown weapon instead of the –2.
(See page 52 of the <I>Players Handbook</I>.)
<P></P>
    Still, to be proficient in all sorts of blades, from the<I> Player's Handbook</I> and additional blades from this rulebook, you'd have to spend around 14
weapon proficiency slots, and that's too many.
<P></P>
    So, we're making it possible to take weapon proficiencies with whole weapon <I>groups</I>.
<P></P>
    For our purposes, there are two types of groups: Tight Groups and Broad Groups.
