 The <I>AD&amp;D®</I> game isn't all combat and magic, and so a warrior doesn't have to be just a
collection of numbers which responds to situations by killing everything in
sight and collecting coins. No, there's much more to role-playing than that, and
this chapter is devoted to role-playing the warrior character.
