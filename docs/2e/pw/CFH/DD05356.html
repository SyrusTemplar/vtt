 If you're using the Piecemeal Armor rules from earlier in this chapter,
consider the armor's Breastplate to have the number of DP listed for it in the chart
above. Each arm and leg will have a DP amount equivalent to one-tenth of the DP
total from the chart. The breastplate will take all DP damage from attacks
unless they are Called Shots to other body parts.
