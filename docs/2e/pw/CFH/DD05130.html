 Some warrior characters (Paladins, Rangers, and multi-class Fighter/Mages and
Fighter/Priests) do have spells. At this point in the character creation
process, for the multi-class characters, you and the DM will have to determine the
character's spells. (Paladins and Rangers wait until 9th and 8th levels,
respectively, to get their spells, so you don't have to worry about them for a while.)
