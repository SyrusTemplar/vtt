 The types of armor listed in the equipment section of the <I>Player's Handbook</I>, page 69, include only two types of helmet (great helm and basinet) and then
don't really describe what the differences are between them . . . other than
price and weight.
<P></P>
    <I>In The Complete Fighter's Handbook</I>, we'll talk about six different types of head protection. Each one has
different effects on the character's ability to see things and to protect himself
from different types of damage.
