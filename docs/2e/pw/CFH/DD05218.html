 Here's an example of how a character can use the weapon proficiencies, weapon
specialization, and style specialization rules to become very dangerous and
very versatile indeed.
<P></P>
    <I>Berris is a 1st level fighter, but he's already very accomplished with his
weapon of choice, the Bastard Sword. He has taken Weapon Specialization with the
Bastard Sword (two slots), Two-Hander Style Specialization with the Bastard
Sword (one slot), and Single-Weapon Style Specialization with the Bastard Sword
(one slot).
<P></P>
    From his weapon specialization, he receives a +1 to attack rolls and +2 to
damage whenever using a Bastard Sword, regardless of the technique he uses.
<P></P>
    When using the weapon in Single-Weapon Style, one-handed, he gets a +1 to AC.
<P></P>
    When using the weapon in Two-Hander Style, his weapon's speed factor drops
from an 8 (normal two-handed speed factor for the Bastard Sword) to a 5, making it
a very quick weapon in his hands.
<P></P>
</I>

<P></P>

<P></P>
 Since style specializations give the character certain benefits in combat,
these benefits need to be written down on your character sheet.
<P></P>
    The character sheet has blanks for all pertinent notes. For example, with the
Berris character mentioned just above, the character sheet would include blanks
with the following information:
