 Here are a couple of tips to give you more options in combat.
<P></P>

 With all the rules and options we've introduced in <I>The Complete Fighter's Handbook</I>, we need to remind you to be diligent about asking about Called Shots during
the Combat Sequence.
<P></P>
    In the game, combat follows this sequence:
<P></P>
    (1) The DM decides what the NPCs and monsters will do;
<P></P>
    (2) The DM asks the players what they will do;
<P></P>
    (3) Initiative is rolled; and
<P></P>
    (4) Combat is resolved in initiative order.
<P></P>
    In a lot of campaigns, Step 2 is skipped. The DM decides what the NPCs or
monsters are doing, has everyone roll initiative, and then asks the
player-characters, as their actions come up, what they're doing.
<P></P>
    But if you're using Called Shots, you have to be diligent about keeping Step 2
in the sequence, so that the characters' Called Shots can be established
before initiative is rolled.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 There's another good reason not to skip Step 2 of the Combat Sequence:
<P></P>
    Though combat is the warrior's profession, some DMs launch the
player-characters into combat more often than they necessarily need to.
<P></P>
    Why is this? It's because it becomes very easy to narrate an encounter this
way: &quot;You round the corner and there, 30 feet ahead, you see a party of six orcs
advancing. They see you, too. Roll for initiative.&quot;
<P></P>
    Once again, Step 2 is skipped; and, merely by saying &quot;Roll for initiative,&quot;
you presume that the player-characters will attack the orcs, and that the orcs
will attack the PCs. Not only do you presume it: You practically guarantee it.
The players will follow the DM's call for initiative, and combat is joined before
anyone figures out that they had other options.
<P></P>
    If this has become your habit when DMing, try substituting some other
statement instead: Ask &quot;What do you do?&quot; instead of calling for initiative rolls. This
gives the players the opportunity to talk to or challenge the other party.
Combat might result anyway; a particularly militant PC, or aggressive NPCs, could
bring about a combat immediately. But if that doesn't occur, the PCs and NPCs
can talk, argue, choose to fight or agree to cooperate, whatever they choose.
<P></P>
    If the two groups decide to fight, roll initiative normally.
<P></P>
