 Often, an enemy will be holding something and a hero will not wish him to hold
on to it. If the attacking character wishes to knock it out of his hand,
that's the Disarm maneuver; if he wishes to destroy it in the opponent's hand,
that's Smashing Something Being Held.
<P></P>
    If an alchemist is holding a bottle of flammable liquid to hurl at the party,
it's very heroic to swing a sword or throw a knife and smash it while he holds
it up to throw: With one blow, you've protected your friends and immolated an
evil enemy. If a demonic foe has finally gotten his hands on the Cursed Wand of
Anti-Life, it's more than appropriate to fire an arrow or quarrel and smash it
in the demon's hands.

    Again, the DM decides how many points it takes to smash such things. In the
case of a vial of liquid, it's not much—one or two at most.
