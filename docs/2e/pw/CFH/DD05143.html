<P></P>
 <B>Description:</B> The Myrmidon is the ultimate soldier. Soldiering is his life. He may be a
high-ranking officer or a career sergeant; he may belong to one nation's armed
forces or may be a mercenary. To the campaign and the adventuring party, he brings
discipline and a useful understanding of military tactics; he's often rigid
and contemptuous of rugged individualists or characters who don't like to take
orders, so he can cause a lot of friction in an adventuring party, too.
<P></P>
    When first created, the Myrmidon's player must decide whether his character is
part of a standing army or a mercenary unit. If he's part of a standing army,
he's employed as a soldier or officer in the army of a nation, large region,
city guard, or even palace/castle guard. If he's part of a mercenary unit, he
belongs to a group of freelance soldiers who hire themselves to just about anyone
who can pay; or may be a personal bodyguard. The DM will have the deciding vote
in what sort of force the Myrmidon belongs to; if, for instance, the DM
doesn't want to have an all-military campaign, he'll probably insist that the
Myrmidon be a mercenary, currently employed by a player-character or NPC important to
the current story.
<P></P>
    However, in the course of the campaign, the Myrmidon's employment can change,
once or several times. He may start out as a mercenary bodyguard; later in the
campaign, he may find himself commanding a small mercenary force in a border
war; later still, he may accept a commission in the king's army and find himself
a regular officer.
<P></P>
    The choice of whether the character is of a non-commissioned rank (such as
recruit, private, or sergeant) or an officer's rank (such as captain) is entirely
up to the DM, who'll make his choice based on what works best in his campaign's
current storyline.
<P></P>
    To be a Myrmidon, the character must have scores of at least 12 in Strength
and Constitution.
<P></P>
    <B>Role: </B>In the campaign's culture, the Myrmidon is a career soldier. In times of war,
they're heroes to the nation. In times of peace, the common folk often look on
them as parasites, living off taxes but providing no useful service.
Mercenaries are often looked on as bandits and predators. Regardless of the public's
opinion, though, the Myrmidon and the standing army are necessary to the defense of
the nation, and so there are always Myrmidons to be found.
<P></P>
    <B>Secondary Skills:</B> If you're using the Secondary Skills rules, the Myrmidon may choose his
Secondary Skill, but must choose it from the following list: Armorer,
Bowyer/Fletcher, Forester, Groom, Hunter, Leather worker, Navigator, Sailor, Scribe,
Teamster/Freighter, Weaponsmith.
<P></P>
    <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> The Myrmidon may spend his Weapon Proficiency slots any way he chooses.
<P></P>
    <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Bonus Proficiencies: Ancient History (specifically Military History),
Fire-Building. Recommended: (General) Animal Handling, Cooking, Heraldry, Riding
(Land-based), Seamanship, Swimming, Weather Sense, (Priest, double slots unless
Paladin) Reading/Writing, (Rogue, double slots) Disguise, (Warrior) Armorer,
Blind-Fighting, Bowyer/Fletcher, Charioteering, Endurance, Navigation, Set Snares,
Survival, Tracking, Weaponsmithing, (Wizard, double slots unless Ranger)
Reading/Writing.
<P></P>
    <B>Equipment: </B>The Myrmidon may spend his starting gold on whatever sort of arms, armor, and
equipment he chooses. If, when he's first created, it is agreed that he'll be
part of a specific military force with specific equipment requirements, he's
required to buy that equipment, but the DM must give him extra gold in the amount
of half that cost.
<P></P>
    <B>Special Benefits:</B> The Myrmidon has two advantages of note:
<P></P>
    First, he gets a <I>free</I> Weapon Specialization. He must choose it from the following group: Battle
axe, Bow (composite long bow, composite short bow, or long bow), Crossbow (heavy
crossbow or light crossbow), Lance (choice), Polearm (choice), Spear, Sword
(choice).
<P></P>
    Second, the Myrmidon is usually in the employ of some powerful patron. The DM
will have to decide what immediate benefits this grants him; they vary with the
type of employer he is working for.
<P></P>
    For instance, if he's working for a wealthy nobleman, he won't have to spend
any money for room and board and will enjoy an upper-class existence.
<P></P>
    Or, if he's part of a standing army, he may be immune to prosecution by the
civilian authorities (though he can certainly face court martial for misdeeds).
<P></P>
    <B>Special Hindrances:</B> The Myrmidon is instantly recognizable by his military demeanor, erect
posture, disciplined mannerisms, etc. (There are plenty of soldiers and mercenaries
who <I>aren't </I>Myrmidons who aren't so distinctive.) Because he is distinctive, the Myrmidon
is easily remembered and described by witnesses to his adventures; this makes
it easier for the enemy to identify him and follow his trail if he's trying to
escape or travel through dangerous territory.
<P></P>
   A second hindrance is his employer. Naturally, his employer makes many demands
on the Myrmidon. If the Myrmidon is a bodyguard, he must accompany his
employer just about everywhere, regardless of any personal goals or interests the
Myrmidon has. If the Myrmidon is a common soldier, he's subject to the orders of
his officers. If the Myrmidon is a military officer, he's subject to the orders
of his superiors or the local ruler, and bears the added stress of having to
look out for his men whenever they're engaged in military action.
<P></P>
    <B>Wealth Options:</B> The Myrmidon receives the standard 5d4x10 gp starting gold.
<P></P>
    <B>Races: </B>Depending on the way the DM has set the campaign up, any demihuman race can
have Myrmidons. Mercenary Myrmidon demihumans will be travelling mostly in
human-occupied lands, while Myrmidon demihumans in standing armies will usually stick
to their own race's territories . . . although some special ones (i.e., the
player-characters) will often find themselves sent out on special quests and
adventures all over the campaign world.
