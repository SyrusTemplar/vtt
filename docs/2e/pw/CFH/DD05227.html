 If you're a very experienced fighter, and are willing to suffer a serious
penalty in order to impress your enemy, you can perform an &quot;expert disarm&quot; against
single-hand weapons only. This suffers the penalty of <I>two </I>Called Shots: Announce intent before initiative, then suffer a +2 to
initiative and a –8 to attack rolls.
<P></P>
    But if it does hit, when you Disarm the weapon, you can send it pretty much
where you want it to, within 12 feet of the target. If, for instance, one of your
allies has lost his sword, and your enemy is wielding a comparable sword, you
might wish to Expertly Disarm your enemy's sword to land right in front of your
friend. Or, if you're fighting with a dagger and your enemy has a sword you
want, you might Expertly Disarm his blade to fly up into the air; you drop your
knife and the sword drops right into your hand.
<P></P>
    This is an almost preposterously heroic sort of thing to do (it only happens
in the most swashbuckling fiction and movies, after all) so the DM may not wish
to allow this option in a more gritty or realistic campaign. On the other hand,
he may grant bonus XP to characters with the temerity to try it . . . and
succeed!
