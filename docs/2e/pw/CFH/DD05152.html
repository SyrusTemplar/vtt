<P></P>
 These Warrior Kits are designed to add depth to a warrior-class character. But
if the character is already multi-class (for example, an elf fighter-mage), he
doesn't <I>need</I> any more depth. Therefore, only single-class warriors can take one of the
Warrior Kits described above.
<P></P>
    However, with your DM's permission, there's no reason why a multi-class
warrior can't use his weapon and nonweapon proficiency choices to simulate one of the
Kits . . . and, again with DM permission, the characters possessing that
Warrior Kit can consider him &quot;one of their own&quot; within the context of the campaign.
<P></P>
    For example, let us say that your campaign features an elvish Amazon tribe and
you want to play an elf fighter/thief who belongs to that Amazon tribe.
<P></P>
    Build her this way: Have her take Spear and Long Bow Weapon Proficiencies. For
her Nonweapon Proficiencies, have her take Riding (Land-Based) and Animal
Training (she <I>doesn't</I> get either of these for free, like the &quot;real&quot; Amazon, but she can still
choose them). For her Equipment, limit her to the equipment choices of the Amazon.
<P></P>
    If you do all this, and have your DM's permission, within the context of the
campaign, your character will be considered an Amazon. That is, she comes from
the Amazon tribe and the other Amazons consider her to be a shield-sister and
one of their own. <I>You </I>know, and the DM knows, that she doesn't have all the special benefits of the
Amazon Warrior Kit. And the DM is within his rights to assign the character the
special hindrances of the Amazon—after all, you've chosen for her to be
identified with a race of people with those hindrances. But to all outward eyes, she
is indistinguishable from any other elvish Amazon.
