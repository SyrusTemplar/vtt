 It's quite enjoyable to have a whole campaign where everyone is a pirate or
outlaw. In pirate campaigns, all the characters are raiders of the seas; in
outlaw campaigns, everyone is a lawless warrior. In both campaigns, the bands of
characters prey on the weak (but wealthy) and may have important goals to achieve
other than just taking money away from people who have too much of it.

   The DM should determine and then make it clear from the outset whether this
is a &quot;good guy&quot; or &quot;bad guy&quot; campaign.
