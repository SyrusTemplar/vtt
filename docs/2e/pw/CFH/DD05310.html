<P></P>
 A foot-list is organized like a joust, except that its entrants fight on foot,
and are not restricted to the nobility (even when the joust is).
<P></P>
    Since melee weapons are deadlier than blunted lances, some tournament
organizers prefer not to have foot-lists; the chances of a fighter dying are pretty
high, and organizers are not required or expected to have a high-level priest on
hand to raise some peasant warrior who dies in a competition.
<P></P>
    Prizes often consist of weapons and minor jewelry, usually not as expensive or
fancy as those awarded to the jousters.
