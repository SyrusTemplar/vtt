 Often, the winner of the jousting competition gets to choose the tournament's
&quot;Queen of Love and Beauty.&quot; The local ruler or tournament organizer gives him a
crown or coronet, which the fighter may bestow upon any lady (at the
tournament) of his choosing; typically, the crown is placed over the end of the
fighter's lance, so that he might ride along the stands and give the crown, at
lance-point, to the lady of his choice. The Queen of Love and Beauty sits with the
fighter and local ruler at the night's feast, and the award is a sign of status and
respect, but confers no lasting benefit.

    In a campaign where women also fight, naturally, the female fighter would be
given a crown to award to the &quot;King of Grace.&quot;
