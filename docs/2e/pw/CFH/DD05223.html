 This option is not present to let heroes bypass or ignore the AC value of
normal armor. If that were allowed, all PCs and all monsters would be using the
Called Shots maneuver almost exclusively, which would be very annoying.
<P></P>
    No, the Bypassing Armor option is used when the DM has introduced a monster or
enemy which can't be beaten any way except through the discovery and
exploitation of its &quot;weak spot.&quot; Like Talos, the invulnerable bronze man of Greek myth,
these monsters are impossible to damage (this is usually expressed as a
monstrous AC and an invulnerability to any but the most powerful of magical weapons—+4
or better); however, each one has a weak spot.
<P></P>
    These weak spots are always visible to the eye, if the hero thinks to look for
it and can see the body part where it is. (For example, a dragon might not
want to fly; this is so that it can keep its wings folded down over its unarmored
spots.) A clever warrior will realize that it's covering up for something and
try to trick it into moving its wings.
<P></P>
    If a hero is bright enough to look for the weak spot, and perhaps trick a
monster into showing the weak spot, the warrior can then take a Called Shot and hit
it. He'll do the monster great damage (or perhaps kill it outright; that's for
the DM to determine).
<P></P>
    <I>Examples: A dragon which has invulnerable hide (but which, suspiciously, never
opens its mouth to breathe flame . . . because its inner mouth is not
armored); a mechanical man with a small, nearly-invisible slot used by the inventor to
open it up (but which a hero with a knife can use to damage its internal
machinery); a warrior with armored skin but an unarmored ankle; a mummy which keeps
one arm crossed over its chest to protect its otherwise undefended heart; a 9'
high golem whose weak spot is the unseen top of its head.
<P></P>
</I>    Again, this only works when the DM has created a monster which can (or must)
be defeated in this very way. If a fight isn't going the characters' way but the
characters are gradually doing damage to the monster, then the monster
probably isn't one of these invulnerable-beasts-with-weak-spots, and it's pointless to
take lots of called shots at random body parts &quot;just in case.&quot;
