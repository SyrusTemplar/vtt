 A Wrestler can take a Called Shot in order to choose the specific Wrestle
maneuver result he wants. If he succeeds, he does not randomly roll the wrestle
maneuver which takes place; he chooses it. This is of special usefulness when he's
trying to achieve a hold result.
<P></P>
   <I> Example: A wrestler decides to take a Called Shot. Before initiative is
rolled, he announces that he's taking a Called Shot to achieve the result of Arm
Lock. He suffers the usual +1 to initiative; when his turn comes up, he suffers a
–4 to attack rolls. If he hits, the maneuver result is Arm Lock, regardless of
the roll.
<P></P>
</I>    Also, when a fighter is wrestling another character, he might find it to his
advantage to make a Called Shot to pull the enemy's helmet down over his enemy's
eyes, blinding him for a combat round or two.
<P></P>
    But, obviously, such successes depend heavily on the good-will of the DM. If
he thinks such maneuvers are more bother than color, don't try to perform them.
