 These rules for piecemeal armor are, in effect, how the types of Gladiator
Armor described in this chapter are built.
<P></P>
    <B>Thracian</B> armor consists of fasciae, the equivalent of Hide armor worn on two legs—thus
an AC bonus of 1, for an AC of 9.
<P></P>
    <B>Gallic </B>armor consists of fasciae (Hide armor on two legs), one manica (the equivalent
of Splint Mail on one arm, thus an AC bonus of 1), and a protective metal
belt. The belt is a special piece of gladiator armor; it constitutes half a
breastplate of Hide armor in both weight an AC bonus, so it grants an AC bonus of 1.
All together, Gallic armor grants an AC bonus of 3, for a final AC of 7. Note:
The armor belt <I>cannot</I> be worn in addition to a Breastplate, only instead of one.
<P></P>
    <B>Samnite</B> armor consists of a cuirass (a splint mail equivalent breastplate conferring
an AC bonus of 3), and splint-equivalent armor on one arm (AC bonus of 1) and
both legs (AC bonus of 1), for a final AC of 5.
<P></P>
    The piece of armor called the Galerus, worn on the weapon shoulder, does not
add anything to the AC bonus; it is considered part of the sleeve or breastplate.
