<P></P>
 The same rules apply to grabbing monsters . . . but there are a couple of
other things to consider.
<P></P>
    <B>No Strength Ability Score.</B> Most monsters aren't listed with a Strength ability score. This makes
comparisons a little difficult. In general, if the situation ever comes up, the DM
should decide for himself what Strength a specific monster has.
<P></P>
    Here's one rough rule of thumb to approximate a Strength score: Determine how
much damage the monster can do with its single largest attack. That's your
starting number. (In other words, if it does 1–8 damage with its worst attack, you
start with the number 8.)
<P></P>
    If the monster has multiple attacks, add 1 to the starting number per extra
attack the monster has.
<P></P>
    Add 8 to the number if the monster is an animal known for its ability to carry
weight (horses, pegasi, camels) or contains parts of such a monster (as the
hippogriff does).
<P></P>
    The DM may further adjust this number as he desires.
<P></P>
    The result is a rough measure of the monster's Strength.
<P></P>
    (Yes, there will be many examples which don't adhere well to that rule of
thumb. But it's someplace to start.)
<P></P>
    <I>Example: The Nightmare has attacks of 2–8/4–10/4–10. Its largest possible
attack is 10 (our starting number); it has two extra attacks per round (for a +2 to
that starting number); it's a horse-like animal (for a +8). Final Strength
score: 20.</I>
<P></P>
    <B>Size Difference.</B> Also, the relative size of the two combatants is important. Humans are
medium-sized (M) ``monsters.'' They have an advantage when grabbing small monsters
(such as goblins, imps, and children, for instance) and a disadvantage when
grabbing large ones (dragons, golems and hippopotami, for example).
<P></P>
    Treat a character's Strength as 3 higher when he is grabbing and struggling
with a smaller monster, and 6 lower when grabbing and struggling with a larger
one. (This bonus or penalty is <I>halved</I> with player-character races and demihuman NPCs. Thus, halflings, goblins,
kobolds and gnomes are at a –3 when wrestling with Medium-sized opponents such as
humans; Dwarves, because they are so close to human-sized, are not. Humans are
at a mere +1 bonus to Strength when wrestling with halflings, goblins, kobolds
and gnomes.)
<P></P>
    Grabbing is performed with hands only. The character may be wearing gloves or
even the Cestus described in the <I>Equipment</I> chapter of this book, but may not be holding any other weapon in his Grabbing
hand.
