 With this popular style, the fighter has a weapon in each hand—usually a
longer weapon in his good hand and a shorter one in his off-hand. Unless the
character has Style Specialization in this style, the second (off-hand) weapon must be
shorter than the primary weapon.

<P></P>
 One great advantage to this style is that you always have another weapon in
hand if you drop or lose one. A single Disarm maneuver cannot rid you of your
weapons.

<P></P>
 The principal disadvantage to this style, as with some other styles, is that
you don't gain the AC benefit of a shield.

 Please read the &quot;Attacking with Two Weapons&quot; section from the Player’s
Handbook, <A HREF="../PHB/DD01697.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01697.html"> page 96</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, before continuing.

    If you devote a weapon proficiency slot to style specialization with
Two-Weapon Style, you get two important benefits. First, your attack penalty drops;
before, it was a –2 with your primary weapon and –4 with your secondary, but with
Specialization in Two-Weapon Style it becomes 0 with your primary weapon and a
–2 with your secondary weapon. (If you're already ambidextrous, as per &quot;Off-Hand
Weapons Use,&quot; above, that penalty is 0 with primary weapon and 0 with
secondary weapon.)  Second, you're allowed to use weapons of the same length in each
hand, so you <I>can</I>, for example, wield two long swords.
<P></P>
    When fighting with two-weapon technique, you can choose for both weapons to
try the same maneuver (for example, two strikes, or two disarms), or can have
each try a different maneuver (one strike and one parry, one pin and one strike).
If the two maneuvers are to be different, each receives a –1 attack penalty.
<P></P>
    Though rangers don't suffer the off-hand penalties for two-weapons use, they
do not get a bonus to attack rolls if they devote a weapon proficiency slot to
Two-Weapon Style. They do get the other benefit, of being able to use weapons of
equal length.
