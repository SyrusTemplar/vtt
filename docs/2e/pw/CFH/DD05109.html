 Much of <I>The Complete Fighter's Handbook</I> is written with the human character in mind. However, most of the text is
equally applicable to all the other player-character races as well, and can be
used by them without any sort of adaptation necessary.
<P></P>
    All the normal rules for racial ability adjustments, class restrictions, level
limits, languages, and miscellaneous bonuses and penalties will be used, and
all the material in this book can be used for all the demihuman races<I> except where specifically noted in the text</I>.
