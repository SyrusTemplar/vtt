 There's a misconception that armor, particularly plate-type armor, transforms
graceful warriors into lumbering oafs who can be pushed down and sat upon with
comparative ease.
<P></P>
    Nothing could be further from the truth. Armor is designed to be as
accommodating as possible to a fighter's movements, and so the <I>AD&amp;D®</I> game doesn't assign an armored warrior any sort of initiative penalty for
wearing armor.
<P></P>
    Now, armor isn't made for some other types of movement (acrobatics, dancing,
etc.) and so will constrict many other Dexterity-based abilities, as we'll
discuss below. It is also heavy, which slows down an armored character's running
speed, as is already documented in the game.
