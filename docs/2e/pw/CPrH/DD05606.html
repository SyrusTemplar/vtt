 <B>Description:</B> This is a shaman of a savage tribe. This character is a member of the tribe.
The tribe itself is a technologically and culturally primitive one (by the
standards and in the opinions of more &quot;civilized&quot; cultures), but is also one which
is attuned to the natural forces of the world. The Savage Priest interprets the
will of his god and acts as an advisor or leader to the members of his tribe.
<P></P>
 This character might be an animal-totem shaman who assigns all the tribal
warriors their animal totems. He might be the witch-doctor who insists on the
deaths of the adventurers from the outside world. Take a priestess of a nature-god
and give her the Savage Priestess kit, and you end up with something very like a
nymph. Whether the Savage Priest is good or evil, filthy or clean-limbed
depends on the nature of the tribe itself; the DM decides what the tribe is like.
<P></P>
 To be a Savage Priest, a character must have a minimum Strength score of 11
and a minimum Constitution score of 13.
<P></P>
 In abandoning this kit, the character is renouncing his membership with the
tribe and accepting citizenship in some other culture. This frequently happens
with Savage Priests who join adventuring parties, stay with them in travels
through the world, and learn so much of the outside world that they no longer feel
like part of their tribe.
<P></P>
 <B>Barred:</B> Priests of the following god and philosophies may not take this kit: Disease,
Divinity of Mankind, Evil, Good.
<P></P>
 Priests of the following gods are <I>most</I> appropriate to this kit: Animals, Earth, Elemental Forces, Fire, Hunting,
Nature, Sky/Weather, Vegetation.
<P></P>
 <B>Role:</B> In a campaign, this character usually plays the role of the primitive who
finds his world-view shattered by his experiences in the outer world... but who
might teach his &quot;civilized&quot; companions something about simple truth and justice
as he adventures with them. The DM should insist that the character role-play
his tribal origins in the first four or five experience levels, until the
character is more used to the outside world; this priest will be baffled by
&quot;high-technology&quot; inventions (iron and steel weapons, boats made out of more than a
single log, hourglasses, anything more sophisticated than the tools of his tribe),
by civilized morals and ethics, and especially by the strangeness and unfairness
of the laws of civilized men.
<P></P>
 <B>Secondary Skills:</B> The Savage Priest character must take Fisher, Forester, Groom, Hunter, or
Trapper/Furrier as his Secondary Skill (player choice, based on the activities of
his character's tribe).
<P></P>
 <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> The Savage Priest is limited to the weapons his actual priest-class permits
him, and is further limited (when he is first created) to the following set of
proficiencies: blowgun, long bow, short bow, club, dagger, javelin, knife,
sling, spear. After he has adventured in the outer world, the character may learn
other proficiencies.
<P></P>
 <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Bonus Proficiencies: (General) Direction Sense <I>or </I>Weather Sense (player choice), (Warrior) Endurance <I>or</I> Survival (player choice). Recommended: (General) Animal Handling, Animal
Training, Fire-Building, Fishing, Riding (Land-based), Rope Use, Swimming,
(Warrior, double slots unless the priest-class dictates otherwise) Animal Lore,
Bowyer/Fletcher, Hunting, Mountaineering, Running, Set Snares, Tracking, (Priest)
Healing, Herbalism, Local History, Religion, (Rogue, double slots unless the
priest-class dictates otherwise) Jumping, Tightrope Walking, Tumbling, (Wizard,
double slots unless the priest-class dictates otherwise) Herbalism. The Savage may <I>not</I> take Etiquette or Heraldry when first created. 
<P></P>
 <B>Equipment:</B> The Savage Priest, with his starting gold, may buy no armor other than
leather armor and shield, and may buy no weapon not listed above under &quot;Weapon
Proficiencies.&quot; He must spend all his gold when he is created, or lose any &quot;change&quot;
he has left over.
<P></P>
 If you have <I>The Complete Fighter's Handbook</I>, use the Equipment rules for the Savage Warrior Kit instead.
<P></P>
 <B>Special Benefits:</B> The Savage Priest has a special <I>Detect Magic</I> ability, resembling the spell of the same name, which he may use once per day
per experience level he has (i.e., a 5th-level savage could use his ability
five times per day). The rules for this power are:
<P></P>
 <I>Detect Magic</I>. The Savage Priest is in tune with nature and can feel when there is
something magical in the vicinity. As with the first-level Priest spell, he has a 10%
chance per experience level to determine the sphere of the magic.
<P></P>
 <B>Special Hindrances:</B> The Savage Priest is imposing and strange, and he worships his gods &quot;all
wrong&quot; (i.e., civilized folk and priests recognize that his rites are different,
unlike theirs). Therefore, he suffers a -2 reaction adjustment from all civilized
folk (NPCs, that is; PCs can decide for themselves how they react to him). 
<P></P>
 <B>Wealth Options:</B> The Savage starts out with only 3d6x5 gp. After the campaign starts, he will
encounter money, and the player may decide either that he likes the stuff or
rejects it as a stupid city-human idea.
<P></P>
 <B>Races: </B>No special limitations.
