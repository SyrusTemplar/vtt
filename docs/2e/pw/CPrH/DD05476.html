 Now, we get to a topic which adds a lot of color to the priesthood and the
campaign world.
<P></P>
 All priesthoods have certain duties to perform, duties to the god and duties
to the community or civilization. The DM needs to decide what each priesthood's
duties are, and will often be able to use those duties to tie the priest
character in to specific adventures and role-playing situations.
<P></P>
 Following are some sample ideas for priestly duties. The DM can use as few or
as many of these as he wants when designing a new priesthood; he can also
invent new ones to suit his campaign.
