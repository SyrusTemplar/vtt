<P></P>
 Minor offenses which the god punishes include such things as:
<P></P>
 Making a joke about the god (and even then, it must offend the god; some gods
have a sense of humor);
<P></P>
 Failing to perform all required priestly duties in a day (for example, &quot;not
having the time&quot; to listen to the problems of one of the faithful and offer
guidance); and
<P></P>
 Becoming annoyed with the god's demands.
<P></P>
 The god punishes such minor offenses by withholding some of the priest's
spells on the following day.
