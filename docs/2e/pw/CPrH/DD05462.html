 Once the DM has created the individual gods, he ought to relate them to one
another # that is, establish how they feel about one another. This can affect how
their mortal followers, especially priesthoods, feel about one another and
work together.
<P></P>
 These relationships don't have to be very detailed. It's quite sufficient to
say that one god loves another, hates another, likes another, dislikes,
respects, holds in contempt, whatever. Then, simply apply that sentiment to the
priesthoods of the gods.
<P></P>
 And when that sentiment is applied to mortals, it can turn out to be greater
or less than the emotion actually felt by the gods in question.
<P></P>
 For instance, let us say that two gods dislike one another. Their respective
priests may dislike one another with similar intensity. On the other hand, they <I>might not dislike one another at all</I>. They might, in fact, recognize that their gods have certain foibles
(human-like failings of personality), and might look upon those foibles with amusement
and affection but without following them themselves.
<P></P>
 However, these priesthoods instead <I>might loathe one another</I>. They could hate one another with an intensity which far surpasses that of
the gods in question. They could, in fact, start wars on the earth because of
their hatred for one another.
<P></P>
 So, for many gods, the DM may wish to decide how the gods feel about one
another, and then may choose a slightly different view of how their priests react to
one another.
