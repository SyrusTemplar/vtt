 In some stories, humans or sentient races in general start out with an exalted
relationship with their deities and then fall out of the deities' favor. In
Greek myth, for example, the humans were well-beloved of the gods until the god
Prometheus gave them the secret of using fire, which they had lacked until then;
this so offended Zeus that he afflicted mankind with all sorts of ills.
<P></P>
 This sort of thing could be a characteristic of your campaign world's story;
or, mankind might never have had a closer relationship with its gods.
