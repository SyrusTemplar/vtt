 Here, we're providing examples of what we described in such detail in the
previous chapter. 
<P></P>
 In the pages that follow, you'll find more than sixty priesthoods. Each of
these priesthoods constitutes a complete character class of the &quot;priest of a
specific mythos&quot; type. The <I>druid</I> presented in the <I>Player's Handbook</I> is one type of a priest of a specific mythos, and is written up there in
greater detail than the priesthoods presented here. But each of these priesthoods
can be fine-tuned by your DM and adapted more fully to the campaign world.
<P></P>
 Each of these priesthoods follows the normal Priest rules (<I>Player's Handbook</I>, <A HREF="../PHB/DD01477.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01477.html">page 33</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">) for experience level progression and spell progression. Most follow the
normal Priestly eight-sided dice progression for hit points; those which don't will
be singled out in the text.
<P></P>
 For each of these priesthoods, your DM will ultimately have to supply the
campaign-specific details of what the deity's name is, what his family and
relationships are, what his history is, etc. However, players don't have to know all
these details in order to create priest characters; just use the priesthood class
descriptions below, and, when options are provided (for skills, requirements,
powers, etc.), the players can ask the DM which options they should take.  
<P></P>
 This section supplements the material from the &quot;Weapons Allowed&quot; chart from
the <I>Player's Handbook,</I> <A HREF="../PHB/DD01483.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="../PHB/DD01483.html">page 34</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">.
