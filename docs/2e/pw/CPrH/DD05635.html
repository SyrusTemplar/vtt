 The DM needs to decide when youths are considered to reach adulthood in the
culture, and then it's possible to have Confirmations of Adulthood.
<P></P>
 In a culture, this will be handled one of two ways.
<P></P>
 Each youth could have a private ceremony on his birthday. Alternatively, all
youths born in the same year could be confirmed on one specific day of the
calendar.
<P></P>
 Either way, in the ceremony, the priest will acknowledge the youth as an
adult, and this will be marked by allowing the youth some activity which only adults
can perform in the culture (for example, carrying weapons in public, wearing
some garment reserved for adults, receiving a sword, etc.).
