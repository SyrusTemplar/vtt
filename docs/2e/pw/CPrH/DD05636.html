   With this ceremony, the priest visits the newborn child and, in a simple
ceremony, asks the god's blessings upon the child. This is always done in the
presence of witnesses, because it's important in the culture for others to witness
that the child has been born and that specific people (the parents) acknowledge
the child as theirs. This becomes important regarding questions of inheritance
or the succession of the titles of leadership.
