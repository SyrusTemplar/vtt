   The god himself will sometimes send the PC on missions. Often, he will
appear to the PC when he is alone, or will appear to him in dreams, and make his
wish known: &quot;You will travel to the wild lands of the Sylvan Curtain and there
find the artifact known as the Eagle-Spear. Find it; take it from our enemies, who
hold it; bring it back and install it in your temple  . . . &quot;   
<P></P>
 When he investigates the Sylvan Curtain and the Eagle-Spear, the priest will
find that it's certain death to go there alone. He needs adventurers of all
descriptions and abilities to help him if he's to pull off this adventure
successfully . . .
