 The Druid, too, is a priest of a specific mythos. It has been worked up in
more detail than the priests presented here, but is still counted one of their
number. The Druid priesthood has much in common with those of the gods of
Agriculture, Animals, Earth, Fertility, Life-Death-Rebirth Cycle, Nature, and
Vegetation.
