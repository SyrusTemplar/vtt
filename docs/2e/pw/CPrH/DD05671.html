 The same rules given for Specializing in Punching also apply to Wrestling. If
a Priest spends one Weapon Proficiency slot on Wrestling, he is a Wrestling
Specialist:
<P></P>
 He gains a +1 bonus to all his attack rolls with Wrestling;
<P></P>
 He gains a +1 bonus to all damage with Wrestling (that is, all his maneuvers
will do 2 points of damage plus his Strength bonus, and continued holds cause
cumulatively 1 more point of damage for each round they are held); and
<P></P>
 He gains a +1 chart bonus with all Wrestling attacks.
<P></P>
 So if, for instance, he rolls a 9 to hit, and that hits, his result would
normally be a Leg lock. If he chooses, he can change it to an Elbow smash or a
Headlock.
