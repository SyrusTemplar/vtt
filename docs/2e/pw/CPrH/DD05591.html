 One way to do this is to let the god simultaneously have several appropriate
priesthoods. They would actually constitute a single &quot;priesthood&quot; with several
different &quot;orders&quot; in it, each order dedicated primarily to one of the god's
attributes.
<P></P>
 That way, if a specific god (let's call him Kyros the Storm-Shaker) is a god
of both War and Sky, two characters becoming his priests could do so in
different ways. One character can become a priest of the war-god; another is a priest
of the sky-god. But they belong to the priesthood of Kyros, each serving the god
in a different way.
<P></P>
 Let's take an example from real-world mythology. In Greek myth, the god Zeus
was a deity of many, many different attributes. These were some of those
attributes:
<P></P>
   
<P></P>
 Fertility
<P></P>
 Lightning
<P></P>
 Oracles/Prophecy
<P></P>
 Rulership/Kingship
<P></P>
 Sky/Weather
<P></P>
 Strength
<P></P>
 Wisdom
<P></P>
   
<P></P>
 Therefore, in a campaign where Zeus is a god, a character created to be a
priest of Zeus could be any one of those seven types of priests.
<P></P>
 In your own campaign, you can define any god as having two or more attributes,
and therefore two or more different classes of priests can serve that god.
<P></P>
 That's the simple way to do this.
