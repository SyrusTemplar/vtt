 This priest's primary motivation involves converting worshippers of other gods
to worship of his god. Nothing else matters. If someone is not according due
to his god, that someone is going to experience a religious conversion attempt.
(This doesn't mean that the Proselytizer necessarily believes his god to be the
only god. In a land where many gods are worshipped, this is an uncommon
belief. But if he finds someone who worships several gods but excludes his deity, the
Proselytizer goes on the job.)
<P></P>
 Proselytizers can be of any alignment, but most are dutiful priests of good
alignment (lawful good, neutral good, and chaotic good).
<P></P>
 In combat situations, the Proselytizer acts as any other adventurer. He might
be more gullible when it comes to an enemy who pretends interest in his deity
and professes a desire to be converted, but this will only occasionally take
place in the campaign. (The enemy would have to know him and his motivations
pretty well to make this attempt.)
<P></P>
 But in role-playing situations, the Proselytizer talks about little other than
his god, his temple, and his personal adventures in service to his god and his
temple. He can be quite insufferable at times, in fact.
<P></P>
 Ultimately, his adventures may convince him that there are other things to
life than the ongoing conversion of non-believers; at this time, his player may
choose for the character to take on a new, different personality. But even then,
the character is likely to remain a bit more interested in religious
conversions than other examples of his new personality are.
