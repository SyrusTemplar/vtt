 The same rules given for Specializing in Punching and Wrestling also apply to
Martial Arts, with one exception. No character knows Martial Arts
automatically. Therefore, the character must first spend one Weapon Proficiency slot to know
Martial Arts in the first place, and then must spend one more to become a
Martial Arts Specialist.
<P></P>
 As usual, when the character becomes a Martial Arts Specialist:
<P></P>
 He gains a +1 bonus to all his attack rolls with Martial Arts;
<P></P>
 He gains a +1 bonus to all damage with Martial Arts; and
<P></P>
 He gains a +1 chart bonus with all Martial Arts attacks.
<P></P>
 So if he rolls a 15 to hit, and the attack hits, he has performed a Side Kick.
If he uses his +1 chart bonus, he can change that into an Elbow Shot or a Head
Bash. He'll probably choose to change it to a Head Bash, for the improved
damage and improved chance of KO.
