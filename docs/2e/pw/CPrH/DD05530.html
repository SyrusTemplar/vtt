 Agriculture concerns Man harvesting Nature. The god has shown man how to
plant, grow, reap, and utilize crops; man, in turn, worships the god as thanks for
this bounty. The gods of agriculture is different from the other gods of nature
and natural forces in that he represents the elements of growing that man
utilizes and can control.
<P></P>
 The priesthood of this god is principally interested in making sure that
mankind continues to appreciate the agricultural god. An angry god of this sort can
decide that crops fail, either on a local level or even worldwide, resulting in
mass starvation and (eventually, if the god is not appeased) a destruction of
civilization; man would return to a hunter-gatherer culture, living in small
nomadic tribes and following herds of beasts, if this were to take place.
<P></P>
 A god of Agriculture doesn't have to be the god of all agriculture. He could
be the god of a specific crop (especially wheat, barley, corn, vines, olives,
and other principal crops) or of a specific, lesser attribute of agriculture
(sowing, reaping, brewing, etc.).
<P></P>
 Most agricultural deities are female.
<P></P>
 The priests of this god are on good terms with Druids and the priests of
Community, Earth, Fertility, Fire, Life-Death-Rebirth Cycle, Nature, Seasons, and
Vegetation.

Weather. This does not give the priest all the spheres indicated for a priest with
Poor Combat Abilities, so he'll also have more than one Granted Power.
<P></P>
  <B>Powers:</B> <I>Analysis, Detection, Identification</I> (as described in the Designing Faiths chapter) of any sort of domesticated
grain or garden plant; the priest can look at a field and tell what's being
grown, how far along it is in the harvest year, what the state of the crop is
(healthy, diseased, drought problems, etc.), and even what species is growing it
(this can be handy when the party is sneaking up on the dwelling of an unknown
monster and there is a garden nearby, for instance). <I>Create Food &amp; Water</I>: The Priest can cast this spell once per day in addition to all other spells
that he can cast. <I>Immunity:</I> The Priest is immune to the harmful effects of spoiled vegetable or fruit

priest, one third-level priest, one second-level priest, and ten first-level
priests, all of the same god, plus one second-level warrior and eight first-level
warriors to act as guards. The priest may take the following on adventures: Three
priests and two warriors of his choice. The priesthood will pay for half of the
cost of stronghold construction at 8th level. The stronghold must act as a
central source of information about agricultural techniques for the farmers of the
area; the priests must not turn away farmers who come for advice.
<P></P>
 <B>Possible Symbols:</B> Sickle, scythe, sheaf of wheat.
<P></P>
 <B>Notes:</B> The weapons chosen for this priesthood are those which have some bearing in
agriculture.
