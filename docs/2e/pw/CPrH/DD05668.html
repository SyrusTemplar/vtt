</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> As you saw in the <I>Player's Handbook</I>, <I>everybody</I> knows how to punch and wrestle. Any character, from the doughtiest warrior to
the spindliest scholar, knows hot to twist someone's arm or punch him in the
jaw. (Naturally, such factors as strength, dexterity and experience level have a
remarkable effect on how often one hits and how much damage one does.)
<P></P>
 Martial Arts are another matter. By &quot;Martial Arts,&quot; we mean generic unarmed
combat. This isn't karate, kung fu or tae kwan do: It's movie-style martial arts
with no basis in real-world fighting styles.  
<P></P>
 A character may only know Martial Arts if the DM declares that this style is
available for characters to learn. In many campaigns, it won't be. In most
oriental campaigns, it will be. In campaigns where the occidental and oriental
worlds have a lot of contact with one another, it could easily be.
<P></P>
 To know Martial Arts at its basic level, the character must spend one Weapon
Proficiency slot on Martial Arts. That's all it takes. Once he's spent that
proficiency slot, he can use Martial Arts in the same way that other people use
Punching and Wrestling, as we'll describe immediately below.
