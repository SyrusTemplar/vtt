 Unless the priesthood is the State Religion, priests are not immune to the law
for their deeds.
<P></P>
 If, for example, the priest of the god of Justice and Revenge hears about some
great injustice, wanders over to the offender's house and kills the offender,
then he's guilty of murder. There's no question. He'll be arrested, tried, and
(the efforts of his priesthood notwithstanding) probably convicted; the only
thing that could save him would be a declaration from the god, which is usually
not forthcoming.
<P></P>
 Therefore, when priests decide to do something which is illegal in the
culture, they should do so circumspectly. If they wish to accomplish the desires of
their god when those wishes are illegal, they'll have to do so in a fashion which
protects them.
