 As mentioned in the <B>Designing Faiths</B> chapter, each priesthood has its own distinctive costume, and priests
normally wear these priestly vestments whenever they perform their official duties.
Some must wear them whenever they appear in public. 
<P></P>
 It adds color to a campaign when the players know what these vestments look
like. If the DM doesn't wish to design the priestly vestments for all the priest
player-characters, he should allow the players to do so (subject to his final
approval).
