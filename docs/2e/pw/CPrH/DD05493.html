 Though in modern times the terms Celibacy and Chastity have become confused,
here we're only using the older meaning of the word Celibacy: The state of being
unmarried. Priests who are required to be celibate must remain unmarried. A DM
must decide individually for each celibate priesthood if its priests must also
remain chaste (see below).
<P></P>
 A priesthood could require celibacy as a sacrifice to the god, because it was
philosophically opposed to the state of marriage, or for many other reasons.
The fighting priesthood of a war-god might require its priests to stay celibate
so that they won't be distracted by thoughts of home and family while engaged in
warfare.
