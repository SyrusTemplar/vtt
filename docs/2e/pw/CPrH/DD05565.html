<P></P>
 This god is the messenger of the gods. When the rulers of the gods want an
order conveyed to lesser gods, it is given to this deity.
<P></P>
 And so this god's priests are also messengers. They are trained in diplomacy
and are often charged with the duty of conveying important messages (whether
letters, verbal messages, codes, or threats) from one person to another... usually
from one ruler or nobleman to another. The priests take great pride in their
role as neutral conveyers of information, and for the reputation for accuracy
and honesty they enjoy.
<P></P>
 This god is also a favorite god of heralds, spies, and bards, all of whom have
to perform messenger-duties at one time or another.
<P></P>
 Messenger-gods are as likely to be male as female.

Mischief/Trickery, Peace, Rulership, Trade, and War.
