 Priests are often required to wear distinctive costumes proclaiming their
status. They may only have to do so during the performance of their official
functions, or might have to wear their priestly vestments during all waking hours.
<P></P>
 Such items don't have to be full costumes. A priest might be only required to
wear the specific holy symbol of his faith; otherwise, he could wear what he
wished.
<P></P>
   In some faiths, priests cannot wear certain types of clothing. Historically,
some priest-kings of earth-goddess were forbidden to wear clothes with knots
in them; if they wore textile garments, they had to have ragged, unknotted hems.
 
<P></P>
   Priests might also be required to conceal certain parts of their bodies by
clothing. Beyond restrictions imposed by society for modesty's sake, priests
might have to conceal other parts not considered immodest by the general
population.
