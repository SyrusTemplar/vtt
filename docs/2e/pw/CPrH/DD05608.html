 To record your priest kit on your character record sheet, do the following: 
<P></P>
 (1) When you write down the character's priest-class, also add the name of his
priest kit there. If the character were a priest of the Norse god of thunder
and also a peasant priest, you'd write &quot;Priest of Thor/Peasant Priest.&quot;
<P></P>
 (2) Where you write down the character's nonweapon proficiencies, add the ones
you got free from the priest kit, and put an asterisk beside them to indicate
that they are free proficiencies provided by the kit. 
<P></P>
 (3) Wherever you have space for notes, mark down the character's special
benefits and hindrances, and any other facts you want to remember.
