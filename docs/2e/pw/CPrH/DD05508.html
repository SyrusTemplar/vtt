 Followers and Believers are non-player characters who are supposed to help
promote the priest's faith. But<I> what</I> they are in terms of character classes, levels, and duties varies from faith
to faith.
<P></P>
 The DM decides what character classes the followers belong to (based on the
needs and orientations of the player-character priests and the beliefs he
promotes).  
<P></P>
 For example, let us say that the priest serves the God of Strength. The
followers are likely to be all Warriors and Priests of the same god.  
<P></P>
 If the priest serves the God of Mischief, the followers are likely to be
primarily Rogues and priests of the same god. There may be some Warriors and Wizards
among the followers, men and women who are particular admirers of this god and
his attributes as they pertain to combat and magic.
<P></P>
 If the priest serves the God of Agriculture, the followers could be Normal Men
and Women who don't belong to a specific class, with a few priests of the same
god among them.
<P></P>
 Now, it could be that the priest player-character is trying to create a
specialized <I>order</I> within the more generalized faith. A priest of the God of Everything might
want to create a militant order. Though the broad worship of the god includes
every subject and attribute possible, this priest is devoted to the god's
warrior-aspect. Therefore, with the permission of the elders of his faith (and, by
inference, the permission of the DM), all this priest's followers would be warriors
and some priests, probably at higher than first level, whose mission is to
bring war to the enemy and then religious enlightenment to the conquered.
<P></P>
 This sort of thinking is to be encouraged among player-characters. A player
who's thinking of creating a specific religious order is thinking in character
and within the scope of the campaign rather than just thinking about how to
acquire more spells and magical items.
