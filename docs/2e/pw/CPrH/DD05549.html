<P></P>
 This god cautions the mortal races to accept whatever fate that the gods or
even a higher Destiny have in store for them. This is the god of acceptance, of
resignation, of coping without struggling.
<P></P>
 Priests of this faith believe that everything that happens is predestined.
They preach a doctrine of acceptance of the will of the gods, including gods other
than their own. When two gods are in opposition, these priests do not
interfere in the mortal doings resulting from that struggle (unless one of the gods is
the god of fate/destiny, in which case they support him); but when a single god
is pursuing a goal and mortal beings are trying to oppose him, these priests
work on behalf of the god and against the mortals. This takes place even when
the god is evil; these priests take the side of gods against mortals regardless
of the god's motives. In short, this is a very strange priesthood, one that is
philosophical but joyless.
<P></P>
 Lesser gods of this attribute might be gods of specific future events: The war
that destroys all the gods, for instance. Such gods will strive to make sure
that the events they represent do take place, and their priests will dutifully
help.

 The god of this attribute is as likely to be male as female.
