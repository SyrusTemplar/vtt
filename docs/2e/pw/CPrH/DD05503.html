<P></P>
 High Powers are those which are of great use in situations which arise
frequently in the campaign. Here are some examples of High Powers appropriate to
various types of priests:
<P></P>
   
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Charm/Fascination</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
  
<P></P>
 This power works just like the third-level Wizard spell <I>suggestion</I>, except that the priest does not have to use material components to the spell.
<P></P>
 The DM may define this Power as working one of two ways. Either it can be used
in combat (in which case it can be used against only one target at a time), or
it cannot be used in combat (in which it can be used against a number of
targets equal in HD to two times the Priest's experience level).
<P></P>
 In either case, the Priest can use the ability three times per day. If the
target makes his saving throw, he may choose to reject the suggestion, but will
not recognize that priestly magic was being used against him.
<P></P>
 This power is most appropriate to priests of the gods of love, mischief and
trickery, music, and peace, but can be given to any priesthood which has an
influential position in the society.
<P></P>
   
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Immunities</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
  
<P></P>
 This power gives the priest an automatically-successful saving throw against
certain types of damage, attacks, or broad classes of spells.
<P></P>
 Examples of appropriate categories for immunity: 
<P></P>
 Certain types of priests might have automatically successful saves against <B>all Evocation spells.</B> This is a very powerful ability; it means the priest will automatically take
half damage from most damaging spells. (Those spells which don't allow a saving
throw are not stopped or affected by this immunity.)
<P></P>
 Others might have automatic success against all <B>Enchantment/Charm spells.</B> This is equally powerful; it means that the priest will be completely
unaffected by most spells of this sort, as well as other powers such as the vampire's
hypnotic gaze.
<P></P>
 Immunities may be taken against any one wizardly <B>School of Magic,</B> against any one priestly <B>Sphere of Influence,</B> or against all <B>Poisons,</B> as a High Power. There are other, lesser, immunities, discussed below.
<P></P>
 Immunities can work <I>against</I> a character, though. Immunity to <B>all priestly Necromantic spells</B> means that the character does not benefit as much from Healing spells. He
automatically makes his saving throw against them, whether he wishes to or not,
and so gets only half the healing value of the spell.
<P></P>
 The Immunity must be appropriate to the attributes of the god being served.
The priest of a god of healing might have an Immunity to all poisons, while the
priest of the god of love might have an Immunity to Enchantment/Charm spells.
<P></P>
 The most important thing to remember about Immunity is that it isn't complete
protection. It merely gives the character an automatically-successful Saving
Throw. In most cases, this means that he will still take half damage from the
attack or spell.
<P></P>
 There is no limit on the number of times per day a character can use this
ability; whenever he is struck with the appropriate attack, his Immunity helps
protect him.
<P></P>
   
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Inspire Fear</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
  
<P></P>
 This power is similar to the wizard's fourth-level <I>fear</I> spell, though the cleric does not have to use material components.
<P></P>
 A priest with this power can use it twice per day.
<P></P>
 This power is most appropriate to priests of gods with dark or fearsome
aspects: Death, for example.
<P></P>
   
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Shapechanging</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
  
<P></P>
 This power is very similar to the druid's shapechanging Granted Power, not to
the ninth-level wizard spell; read the description of that power in the <I>Player's Handbook.</I>
<P></P>
 The power can be used three times per day; it is the DM's decision whether the
priest can change into three different types of animal, each once per day, or
only into one specific type of animal three times per day.
<P></P>
 This power, though it would seem to be most appropriate to priests of gods of
nature, is actually appropriate for any priesthood . . . if the god in question
has an animal symbol or totem. For instance, if the god of the sky has as his
symbol the eagle, it's appropriate for his priests to have this power and turn
into an eagle three times per day.
<P></P>
   
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Turning Undead</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
  
<P></P>
 This is identical to the cleric's ability. It is most appropriate to priests
of the gods of birth, dawn, fertility, fire, good, guardianship, healing, light,
love, magic, and the sun. There is no limit to the number of times per day a
priest can use this ability.
