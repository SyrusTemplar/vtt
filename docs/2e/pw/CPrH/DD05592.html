<P></P>
  
<P></P>
 The hard way to do this is to create an entirely new priest-class. Use the
Faith Design Sheet from the previous chapter to work such a thing up.
<P></P>
 First, look over the priest class rules for all the classes related to the
attributes you want the god to contain. Then, choose the elements from each you
like. Remember to balance your choices of the priest's combat abilities with
those of his available spheres of influence so that he will not end up
significantly stronger or weaker than any other priest class.
<P></P>
 Let's create such a class as an example. Let's say the goddess Melebeth is the
goddess of Love, but in the city of Askarth she is also the civic deity and is
known as &quot;The Girder-On&quot; because she is said to arm the city's warriors for
combat; she is therefore a goddess of Love, Community, and War. What does her
priesthood look like?
<P></P>
   
<P></P>

<P></P>
  
<P></P>
 The goddess of Community is probably true neutral, but may be of any
alignment. The goddess of Love is any sort of good alignment, and the goddess of War is
any sort of Neutral alignment. Therefore, our combined Community/Love/War
goddess averages out to be neutral good. Her priests should also be neutral good.
<P></P>
   
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Minimum Ability Scores</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
  
<P></P>
 The goddess of Community requires W10, Ch12. The goddess of Love requires W10,
Ch13. The goddess of War requires W9, S13. Wisdom and Charisma are obviously
the leaders here; the priests of this goddess must have Wisdom 10, Charisma 13,
and receive +5% experience if either ability is 16 or better, or +10% if both
abilities are 16 or better.
<P></P>
   
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Races Allowed</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
  
<P></P>
 None of the three priest classes (Community, Love, War) excludes any race.
Therefore, this combined class allows priests who are dwarves, elves, gnomes,
half-elves, halflings, and humans.
<P></P>
   
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Nonweapon and Weapon Proficiencies
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">  
<P></P>
 Community requires Local History. Love requires Herbalism. War requires
Blind-Fighting. None of these seems to apply especially appropriately to this
combined goddess; since she was originally a goddess of Love, with the other
attributes added in this one city, the default should be Herbalism.
<P></P>
 Taking the most appropriate Nonweapon Proficiencies Recommended, we get
Heraldry, Reading/Writing, Religion, Riding Land-Based, Healing, Blind-Fighting, and
Local History.
<P></P>
 Most of the three original classes require no specific Weapon Proficiencies,
so we'll follow that pattern here.
<P></P>
 Nonweapon Proficiency Group Crossovers are obviously Priest, General, and
Warrior.
<P></P>
   
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Duties of the Priest</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
  
<P></P>
 Taking the duties from the three types of priesthoods which are most
appropriate to this combined class, we get:
<P></P>
 Guidance, Marriage.
<P></P>
 Education in the history of the city.
<P></P>
 Vigilance: Trying to preserve the opportunities for romantic love-matches and
marriages in the community, but also recommending marriages which will ally
strong families and benefit the city.  
<P></P>
 Missions of defense when the city is threatened by attackers.
<P></P>
   
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Weapon and Armor Restrictions</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
  
<P></P>
 The Community goddess' priests can use dagger and knife, and two weapons
representing the city. The Love goddess' priests can use bow (small), club, lasso,
mancatcher, and net. The War goddess' priests can use battle axe, dagger/dirk,
knife, lance, mace, maul, polearm, spear, swords (all), warhammer.
<P></P>
 These are three pretty incompatible sets of permitted weapons. But since this
combined-attribute goddess will be using weapons mainly to defend her city, we
can eliminate the comparatively weak weapons of the pure love-goddess; let us
settle on the weapons of the Community goddess' priesthood. This will include
dagger and knife, and (for the city of Ashkarth) bows (any) and long sword.
<P></P>
 As for armor: The Community goddess' priests could use all armor and shields,
the Love Goddess' priests could use no armor or shields, and the War Goddess'
priests could use all armor and shields. It sounds, by weight of numbers, as
though the priests should be able to use all armor and shields. Between the
superior armor and the two good weapons they can use, these priests have Good combat
abilities. This means they will have very limited magic.
<P></P>
   
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Other Limitations</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
  
<P></P>
 Priests of the civic goddess must always wear priestly garments in public;
priests of the love goddess get four-sided hit dice and must be wed by the time
they reach 8th level; priests of the war-goddess have no other limitations.
<P></P>
 The combined-goddess' priests should retain the limitation of wearing priestly
garments whenever they're in public; these priests are still priests of a
civic deity, after all.  
<P></P>
 And since the goddess is still a deity of love, the marriage restriction
should remain.
<P></P>
 But since this goddess is a fighter, let's drop the four-sided hit dice
limitation; priests of this priesthood receive eight-sided hit dice like most
fighting priests.
<P></P>
   
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Spheres of Influence</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
  
<P></P>
 The priests of the community-goddess get: Major Access to All, Creation,
Healing. Minor Access to Combat, Protection.
<P></P>
 The priests of the love-goddess get: Major Access to All, Animal, Charm,
Healing, Necromantic, Protection, Summoning. Minor Access to Creation, Divination,
Guardian, Plant, Sun, and Weather.
<P></P>
 The priests of the war-goddess get: Major Access to Combat, Healing. Minor
Access to Necromantic, Protection.
<P></P>
 Since this priesthood, as we decided above, has Good Combat Abilities, the
priesthood will have Major Access to the All sphere and two other spheres, and
Minor Access to two spheres. Let's choose the most appropriate ones. 
<P></P>
   Therefore, the priests of this combined-trait goddess get: Major Access to
All, Charm, Healing. Minor Access to Combat, Protection.  
<P></P>
   
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Powers</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
  
<P></P>
 Priests of the community-goddess get <I>Incite Berserker Rage, Soothing Word,</I> and<I> Turn Undead</I>.
<P></P>
 Priests of the love-goddess get <I>Charm/Fascination</I>,<I> Incite Berserker Rage, Inspire Fear</I>, <I>Soothing Word</I>, and <I>Turn Undead</I>; these priests received extra powers partly because they had only four-sided
hit dice, a condition that the priests of this combined goddess do not share.
<P></P>
 Priests of the war-goddess get <I>Incite Berserker Rage</I>; <I>At 5th level: Inspire Fear</I>.
<P></P>
 Taking the common threads from these three goddesses, we decide that priests
of the combined-attribute goddess receive:
<P></P>
 <I>Incite Berserker Rage</I>,<I> Turn Undead,</I> and, at <I>5th level, Inspire Fear</I>.
<P></P>
   
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="3"><B>Followers and Strongholds</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
<P></P>
  
<P></P>
 The goddesses of Community and Love both get their followers at 7th level, the
goddess of War at 8th, so we'll settle on 7th level, and also at 7th level the
priesthood will pay for half of the stronghold constructions.
<P></P>
 The goddess of community gets 15 levels of priests and 15 levels of fighters.
<P></P>
 The goddess of love gets 15 levels of priests, five levels of
mage/consultants, five levels of fighter/guards, and five levels of Normal Men and Women with
appropriate Nonweapon Proficiencies.  
<P></P>
 The goddess of war gets 20 levels of priests and 10 levels of fighter/guards.
<P></P>
 Averaging this out somewhat, the priest of our combined-aspect goddess should
get 15 levels of priests (three third-level priests and six first-level
priests), 10 levels of fighters (two third-level fighters and four first-level
fighters to act as guards), and five levels of mage/consultants (one third-level mage
and two first-level mages). On adventures, he can take three priests (as usual,
only one can be third-level; the remaining two third-level priests run the
temple in the character's absence), three fighters (ditto), and one mage of his
choice.
