 <B>Description:</B> The Peasant Priest is the antithesis of the Nobleman Priest above. He's a
champion of the common man, and prefers serving the commoner to any association
with nobles. He has taken a vow of poverty; he believes he should sacrifice his
worldly goods to the glory of his deity.
<P></P>
 Note that the Peasant Priest need not have been born a peasant; he could have
been born a nobleman and later abandoned that lifestyle and the privileges of
his class.
<P></P>
 There are no ability-score requirements to be a Peasant Priest.
<P></P>
 There are no special rules for abandonment of this kit.
<P></P>
 <B>Barred:</B> Priests of the following gods, forces, and philosophies may not take this
kit: Evil, Good, Prosperity.
<P></P>
 <B>Role:</B> In the campaign, the Peasant Priest devotes himself to the needs of the
common man. If he's part of an adventuring party, he won't support any plans which
endanger or exploit the peasants or serfs, and will try to recommend plans which
advantage them. (For example, if the party wants to use the locals to help
lure the dragon out of its cave, so that the locals will be the first ones flamed
and eaten, the priest will object. But if the locals are to be along as support
troops, and have information and chances of success and survival at least
equal to the player-characters', he won't have any such objection.) He'll insist
that treasures be shared with the locals of the area where the treasure was
found. (Assuming that the treasure is split into even shares among party members,
he'll insist that the local peasant community receive two shares, for example.)
In a greedy or tight-fisted party, the party might refuse his requests, which
doesn't mean the priest has to attack them or steal from them... but this will
inevitably result in the priest becoming disillusioned with the party. 
<P></P>
 <B>Secondary Skills:</B> The player may choose his priest's secondary skill.
<P></P>
 <B>Weapon Proficiencies:</B> The player may choose his character's weapon proficiencies, subject to the
limitations of the priest's actual priest-class. The DM may insist that the
character start out the campaign only with proficiencies appropriate to a peasant,
such as short sword, spear, bow, footman's weapons and the like; long swords
(and bigger blades), horseman's weapons, exotic polearms, lances, tridents and the
like are not. This should only be a restriction when the character is first
created; afterwards, he can learn any weapon his priest-class allows him.
<P></P>
 <B>Nonweapon Proficiencies:</B> Bonus Proficiencies: Agriculture <I>or </I>Fishing (player choice), Weather Sense <I>or </I>Animal Lore (player choice). Recommended: Any of the General proficiencies.
<P></P>
 <B>Equipment:</B> The Peasant Priest has restrictions on the way he spends his money. Other
than weapons, with which he has no monetary limitation, he may own only one object
worth as much as 15 gp, and other than that one object may own nothing worth
more than 10 gp. He may never own more than 75 gp worth of (non-weapon) property
at any one time. If he receives money or gifts which put him above that limit,
he must give away money and possessions until once again he is within the 75
gp limitation.
<P></P>
 <B>Special Benefits:</B> The Peasant Priest always has shelter when he's in his own community; his own
people will shelter him even from the land's rightful authorities. Among
peasants of other communities, he cannot count on this benefit, but he receives a +2
reaction adjustment from all peasants.
<P></P>
 <B>Special Hindrances:</B> The Peasant Hero's great limitation is described above under &quot;Equipment.&quot; 
<P></P>
 <B>Wealth Options:</B> The Peasant Priest gets the standard 3d6x10 gp starting money. Of the money
he receives, no more than 75 gp may be spent on goods other than weapons.
<P></P>
 <B>Races:</B> No special limitation.
