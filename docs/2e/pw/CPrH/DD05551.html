 This god is the deity of fire in all its aspects: The spark of civilization,
the cleanser of sickness and evil, the terrifying natural force, the special
gift of the gods to man, the principal force behind some sorts of magic.
<P></P>
 The priesthood is devoted to celebrating fire and honoring the god of this
most useful gift. They make burnt sacrifices to the god and learn as much as they
can of fire-magic.
<P></P>
 Lesser gods of this attribute will be gods of just one aspect of fire. One
might be a god of forest-fires, one a god of the fires used by metalworkers and
pottery-makers, one a god of the hearth-fire that represents home and shelter.
<P></P>
 Fire-gods are as likely to be male as female.
<P></P>
 The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Dawn, Elemental
Forces, Justice/Revenge, Light, Lightning, Magic, Metalwork, Race (Dwarf), and
Sun. They are not that fond of, but also not <I>enemies </I>of, the priests of Oceans/Rivers. The priests of this god dislike the priests
of Disease.
<P></P>
 <B>Alignment:</B> The deity is true neutral. The priests may be neutral evil, true neutral, or
