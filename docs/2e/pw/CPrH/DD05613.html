 No two priests are alike in their goals, desires, quirks, and prejudices. It
doesn't matter if they belong to the same priest-class, have the same Priest
Kit, are at the same experience level and have rolled the same hit points . . . 
they're going to be different people.
<P></P>
 Below are descriptions of several common type of priest characters. All of
these personalities are drawn from priest character stereotypes common to the
movies and fiction. Novice role-players should read through these descriptions and,
if they wish, adopt one of these personality types for their priest characters
or at least let these descriptions inspire them to work out the details of
their characters' personalities. Experienced role-players, to whom the creation of
personalities is second nature, should skip on to &quot;Priest Adventures.&quot;
