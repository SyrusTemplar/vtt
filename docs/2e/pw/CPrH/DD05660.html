 Most faiths have a holy symbol, some sign which serves as a representation for
the god and his faith. This symbol is usually duplicated in wood, glass, or
precious metals and carried by priests of the god. Ordinary followers of the god
also can carry the holy symbol.
<P></P>
 Every priest player should know what his holy symbol looks like. The DM can
either decide, or let the player of the priest design it. (If he does allow the
player to do so, the design of the symbol is still subject to the DM's approval.)
<P></P>
 It's easy to create symbols for most deities, and there are suggestions for
symbols for all the gods represented in the <B>Sample Priesthoods</B> chapter.
