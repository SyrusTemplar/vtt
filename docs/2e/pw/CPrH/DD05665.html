 The <B>Bill</B> is a short hook on a short cross-handle, and is a weapon derived from the
sort of hook used to spear and haul in fish or to carry sides of meat around.
<P></P>
 The<B> Lasso</B> is a rope with a loop at the end; it's thrown at targets, and on a successful
hit the loop settles around the target. The wielder can then pull the rope
taut and seriously inconvenience his target. Extensive rules for the lasso appear
in <I>The Complete Fighter's Handbook</I>.
<P></P>
 The <B>Maul</B> is a polearm with a heavy bludgeoning head at the end. It is therefore a
Bludgeoning weapon, and is appropriate for the use of clerics and specific priests
who aren't allowed to use bladed weapons. When a priesthood allows the use of
polearms, this includes the maul (and the mancatcher, for that matter); but when
maul alone is listed, the priest cannot use the other polearms.
<P></P>
 The <B>Net </B>is a weighted combat net on the end of a rope. Like the lasso, it is thrown to
spread over a target; if it hits, it can be pulled closed, and the trailing
rope used to pull the victim around. Also like the lasso, extensive rules for
this weapon's use appear in <I>The Complete Fighter's Handbook</I>.
<P></P>
 The<B> Nunchaku</B> is an oriental weapon and only suitable for oriental-based campaigns. It
consists of two wooden handles connected by a short chain or short length of cord.
It was originally derived from an agricultural implement, which is why so many
priests of nature-oriented gods can use it.
<P></P>
 The <B>Scythe </B>is a large, curving blade that is sharp only on the underside of the blade
(the concave edge); the blade is attached to a twisted pole some 5-6' in length.
The wielder uses the weapon two-handed. The scythe is a harvesting tool used by
farmers to cut down their grain; as a weapon, it is symbolic of gods of
agriculture, time, and death.
