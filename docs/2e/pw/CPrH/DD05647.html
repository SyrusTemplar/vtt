 Priests are servants of their gods, and therefore can't just do anything they
want whenever they want. The DM must keep an eye on the activities of priest
characters (including clerics and druids), and if the priest violates some tenet
or commandment of his god, the DM should see to it that the god punishes the
priest.
<P></P>
 It's easy to be unfair when doing this, though, so the DM also has to keep an
eye on <I>himself.</I> It's all too easy to say, &quot;You should have <I>known </I>that your god doesn't want you to wear red; I've said repeatedly that his
favorite color is blue!&quot; That's not justification for a punishment of the priest,
unless the DM has explicitly stated that the god's priests must always wear blue
or face divine consequences.
