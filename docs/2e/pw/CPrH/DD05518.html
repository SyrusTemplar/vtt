 Once he's decided how the campaign's chief culture is arranged, the DM can
make the same decisions about all the other, foreign, cultures in his world.
<P></P>
 Then, if he wishes, he can add still more detail to the religious fabric of
his campaign setting by defining how different cultures regard one another's
religious practices.
<P></P>
 Some cultures avidly welcome the introduction of new religious elements into
their own. Pantheistic cultures, especially those which have no dominant faith,
are likely to welcome worship of each foreign god that is encountered.
<P></P>
 Some cultures violently oppose such an introduction. For example, a culture
might be pantheistic, worshipping many gods, and yet still believe that its
pantheon is the only true pantheon . . .  and that all foreign gods and foreign
pantheons are lies or demons.
<P></P>
 Foreign cultures often worship some of the same gods as the campaign's
principal culture, but do so under different names, with different rites, and
believing in different stories about those gods. A tolerant culture will welcome new
interpretations of their gods. An intolerant one will, at best, seek to educate
the foreign culture to &quot;correct its misunderstandings&quot;; at worst, it will insist
that the foreign land be conquered and forcibly &quot;corrected.&quot;
<P></P>
 This, then, is another way to add detail and texture to a campaign: By
deciding how foreign faiths regard one another, and what effect that regard has on the
cultures involved. These effects range all the way from increased trade and
exchange of knowledge through war, conquest, and even genocide.
