 Some players will eventually ask themselves, &quot;If the gods are sentient but
forces and philosophies are not, then if I become priest of a force or philosophy,
I don't have some god dictating what I can and can't do. I can do anything I
want to.&quot;  
<P></P>
 The DM needs to step on this sort of foolishness when it crops up. Though
forces and philosophies are not sentient beings, they can still enforce their ethos
and tenets on their priests.
<P></P>
 For example, if a priest of the Philosophy of Good does evil things, the
natural power of the philosophy will abandon him (denying him all his priestly until
he repents, makes amends, and again follows the restrictions of the
priesthood).
