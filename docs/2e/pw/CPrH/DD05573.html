<P></P>
 This god is devoted to the cause of peace. He prefers for all conflicts to be
settled non-violently.
<P></P>
 His priests, in turn, work to keep things peaceful. They intercede between
nations which are on the brink of war. They suggest compromises and nonviolent
ways of settling important issues. They do their best to keep things calm and
civil.
<P></P>
 Remember, though, when role-playing such priests, that they don't have to be
played as stupid. Nor do they have to presume that every fight can be avoided;
when it's obvious that a situation will descend into violence regardless of
their best efforts, they don't have to continually badger other players into not
fighting. They <I>do </I>have to try to preserve peace when it <I>can</I> be preserved, and to prevent unnecessary violence when possible. A player who
takes a peace-priest character would do well to become party spokesman; this
will allow him to do all the party's negotiations and thus head off combat
situations on a more frequent voice.
<P></P>
 A god of peace is as likely to be male as female.
<P></P>
 The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Community,
Competition, Good, Healing, Love, Messengers, Prosperity, Race (Halfling), and
Rulership/Kingship. The priests of this god dislike the priests of Justice/Revenge
and War.

resolutions to various situations. If they prefer fighting things out, they'll
