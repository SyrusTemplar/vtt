 Occasionally, a priesthood will demand a sacrifice of mutilation of its
priesthood. This is most common among evil priesthoods, but could theoretically occur
with any priesthood, regardless of alignment.  
<P></P>
 For example, devotees of a blind god of prophecy might be forced to blind
themselves. (However, it would be more appropriate for them merely to have a
Clothing restriction that required them to wear blindfolds when performing official
duties.)
<P></P>
 When this sort of thing does take place, the priesthood is often compensated
for its loss: The god often grants them an extra power (as described below,
under &quot;Powers of the Priest&quot;). A priesthood required to be blind, for example,
might have an extra power of analysis, identification or prophecy.
