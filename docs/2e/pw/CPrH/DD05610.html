 A character created with a Priest Kit might, later in his adventuring career,
decide that he has to abandon it. For instance, a Pacifist Priest might be
crushed when his inaction resulted in the death of a friend, and might decide to
abandon his pacifistic stance.
<P></P>
 The player must tell the DM that he wishes his character to abandon the kit.
If this choice is the result of some traumatic event, as in the example above,
the character may simply wish to declare his intent. If the choice is a gradual
one, the DM may want to work it into the storyline.
<P></P>
 The priest abandoning his kit will have to role-play out his decision and its
consequences. He'll announce his decision . . .  and he must suffer the
reactions of his allies (and the other members of his order!), whether good or ill.
<P></P>
 He will give up all the kit's bonuses and hindrances. The character does not
give up any bonus proficiencies, but they are no longer &quot;bonuses.&quot; The character
must &quot;pay&quot; for them by spending the next proficiency slots he receives on them.
<P></P>
 Once he's abandoned a Priest Kit, the character may not take another Priest
Kit to replace it. At this point, he's a normal priest of his specific mythos for
the rest of his playing life.
