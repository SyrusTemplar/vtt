 This priest is a young fellow who has newly achieved his priestly rank. (Yes,
all first-level priests are appropriate for this personality . . . but not all
of them <I>have</I> to take it. Other first-level priests can be a little more sophisticated or
world-wise than this fellow.)
<P></P>
 The Earnest Novice is naive. He's easily tricked by smooth, polished liars. He
is pure in his beliefs, especially those related to his priestly order. He
serves as an inspiration for others; no matter how battered he is by life, he
seems always just to stand back up and keep on going.
<P></P>
 This character is best suited to the range of good alignments (lawful good,
neutral good, chaotic good).
<P></P>
 In combat situations, this character is prone to be a bit simple. He has very
primitive combat tactics, such as &quot;run at the enemy and hit him,&quot; or &quot;stand
where you are and shoot him;&quot; such things as flanking maneuvers, feints, false
retreats, and other military maneuvers are beyond his comprehension.
<P></P>
 In role-playing situations, this character expresses cheerful optimism and,
usually, a lack of understanding about the way the &quot;real world&quot; (that is, the
campaign world) works. It doesn't occur to him to slip a waiter a bribe to get
better service: That would be monstrously unfair and unprofessional! The ideas
that a colleague might be corrupt, that a judge might render a decision based on
how he felt that morning, that a beautiful young lady might not be absolutely
virtuous are all alien to him. He'll accept them when his nose is rubbed in them
. . .  but they'll never occur to him naturally.
<P></P>
 Most players who take this personality eventually abandon it; it's nearly
impossible to play a character as remaining entirely innocent of the world through
adventure after adventure. See &quot;<A HREF="DD05622.html"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD05622.html">Changing Personality Types</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">&quot; below for more on this.
