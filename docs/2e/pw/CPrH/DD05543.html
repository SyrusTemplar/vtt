<P></P>
 This is not a god, but a philosophy, and one so compelling that it generates
magical energy which priests of the philosophy can tap like a true god's priests
are granted energies by the god.
<P></P>
 This philosophy states that mankind (specifically, the human race, including
half-elves reared among humans, but excluding dwarves, elves, gnomes, halflings)
is nearly a divine being, and should do as much as he can to achieve
perfection # physical, mental, and emotional perfection, always and in all ways. The
philosophy encourages men to strive for the physical ideal and to learn as much as
possible of the world.
<P></P>
 So that's the idea that the priests promote. They cooperate in all sorts of
educational, artistic, and competitive enterprises, seek to counsel people in
every aspect of living their lives, and provide sanctuaries for people to meditate
on the priesthood's teachings.
<P></P>
 The priests of this philosophy are on good terms with the priests of
Ancestors, Arts, Competition, Crafts, Literature/Poetry, Metalwork, Music/Dance, Good,
Love, Race (Human), Strength, and Wisdom. The priests of this philosophy dislike
the priests of Evil.
