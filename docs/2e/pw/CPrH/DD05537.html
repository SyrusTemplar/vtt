 This god represents the crafting and creation of all sorts of non-metal goods:
Wooden art objects, furniture, textiles, clothing, leather goods, glassware,
porcelain ware, and so forth. He may also be the god of engineering and
stonemasonry.
<P></P>
 This god's priests try to support and aid young craftsmen, to encourage the
exchange of ideas and techniques between different cities and different guilds,
and to improve the state of sophistication of all crafts and related arts.
<P></P>
 Lesser gods of this attribute would be gods of specific craftsman arts. One
might be the God of Woodworking; one might be the God of Leatherworking.

 Gods of crafts are equally likely to be male or female.

Culture, Divinity of Mankind, Light, Literature/Poetry, Metalwork,
Music/Dance, Race (Dwarven), Race (Elven), Sun, and Trade.

participate in semiannual events where crafts are displayed and promoted (before the
throne or in market). Investigation: These priests are keen on history and seek to
re-discover lost craftsman techniques and arts; this often leads them into old
ruins and lost cities on expeditions of discovery. Vigilance against any enemy,
ruler or private enterprise who seeks to suppress learning, especially of
craftsman learning. (However, these priests encourage competitive thinking between
guilds, or between the craftsmen of different cities; though this results in
hard feelings sometimes, it does advance the state of craftsmanship.)

crafted goods as to their gold piece value of he does not have that nonweapon
