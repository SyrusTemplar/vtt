 When followers die, they are replaced by whatever means brought them to the
temple in the first place. A new local will volunteer his service, or the church
hierarchy will send a replacement, or the god will inspire a new NPC to
volunteer his service.
<P></P>
   It's all right for followers to gain in experience. A soldier who defends
his temple from attackers can be expected to gain experience points; a follower
who accompanies his priest on adventures can, too.  
<P></P>
 Only followers who have been given individual names and personalities should
gain in experience. An anonymous first-level fighter guard can be expected to
remain so; but a named character could rise through levels and become
guard-lieutenant, guard-captain, personal bodyguard to the priest, etc.
<P></P>
 Named followers gain experience at normal rates based on what they do in their
adventures. The only limits placed on all this personal growth are these: No
follower can be higher than three experience levels below the level of the
priest; and the levels of all followers of a specific temple or church cannot add up
to more than 100. 
<P></P>
 If a group of followers becomes so experienced that it adds up to more than
100 levels, the DM can take steps to reduce the number of levels. For instance, a
senior guard-captain may leave the temple when offered captaincy of a
guard-unit in another temple (one closer to his family, one more prestigious, etc.).
He'd be replaced by a captain of lower level, thus adjusting the available
experience levels downward.
<P></P>
 Whenever a follower dies or leaves, he is replaced by a follower who was at
the experience level the original character held when he first became a follower.
<P></P>
 For instance, let us say that a temple starts with a third-level wizard who
acts as the priest's advisor. Through adventuring, this wizard rises to sixth
level, and then is killed in an adventure. He will be replaced by a third-level
wizard.
<P></P>
 If a guard-captain rises from second to sixth level in the course of
adventuring, and then leaves for service elsewhere, he'll be replaced by a second-level
fighter. This doesn't mean that the new fighter is the guard-captain. The
priest may prefer for some other follower, who is higher than second-level, to be
the new guard-captain. But the replacement character always arrives at the
experience level the original character held <I>when he first became a follower.
