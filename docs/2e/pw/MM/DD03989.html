Werewolves are the most feared of the lycanthropes, men who can transform into
wolflike beasts. They should not be confused with <I>wolfweres</I> (q.v.) -- wolves who turn into men. Great enmity exists between werewolves
and wolfweres.
<P></P>
 The human forms of werewolves have no distinguishing traits. The werewolf form
is equally varied. Many have a bipedal form that is a hybrid of human and
lupine features. These creatures are about 1-foot taller and stronger than their
human forms. The bodies are fur-covered and have short tails, wolflike legs, and
heads that are combinations in varying degrees of human and lupine features.
<P></P>
 A second form of hybrid is more wolflike, and may be mistaken for a large wolf
when it runs on all four legs. This hybrid can also walk erect and has
humanlike hands.
<P></P>
 Another type of werewolf (about 20%) looks exactly like a large wolf about the
size of a bear. This creature has no human features, although the eyes may
glow red in the dark.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">In their human forms, werewolves attack with a variety of weapons, generally
those common to their human identity and class. In the werewolf or wolflike
forms, the creature attacks with its fearsome teeth. If the form has hands, the
werewolf may grab its prey for a better bite.
<P></P>
 In the wolf form, the werewolf can be harmed only by silver or magical weapons
of +1 or better. Wounds from other weapons heal too quickly to actually injure
the werewolf.
<P></P>
 Werewolves attack in packs; packs including females and young drive the adults
to hit harder. If the female is attacked, the male fights at +2 to hit and
does full damage with each blow. If the young are attacked, the female attacks at
+3 to hit and does full damage. Cubs with 60% full growth are -4 to hit, cubs
with 70% are -3 to hit, and so on. All cubs inflict 2-5 points of damage.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Werewolf packs roam the wilderness in search of human or other prey. True
werewolves tend to be nomadic, although infected werewolves often continue to live
the life to which they were accustomed. Werewolves retreat to their dens during
the winter months or the years when the females are raising the helpless cubs.
As humans, werewolves do not build homes, although they may take over existing
dwellings, sometimes the home of past victims. Caves and burrows are the dens
most commonly used in the wild. These sparsely furnished retreats are used
mostly as a sleeping area and a place to store their human possessions. Many
werewolf families roam the countryside in wagons, much like gypsies. In fact, this
has caused many gypsies to be accused of being werewolves.
<P></P>
 Werewolves live in packs, generally related by bloodlines. Werewolf packs of
five to eight individuals are single family groups consisting of a male, female,
and three to six cubs, six to nine years old. Cubs under six years old are
kept in secluded dens and never encountered by hostile humans.
<P></P>
 When pregnant, the female retreats with her mate and an older female who will
act as midwife. In a very secluded area they prepare a special den that will be
home for the mother and her cubs for the next six years. The female gives
birth to a litter of 5-10 cubs. The cubs are born in the hybrid form; they resemble
fuzzy human babies with wolflike faces. Infant mortality is high; 2-4 cubs of
each litter never reach 60% growth. Cubs grow at the same rate as humans for
their first five years. By the sixth year they attain 60% of their full growth.
At this point they develop the ability to transform into their other forms. Each
following year brings an increase of an additional 10% growth. Werewolves are
considered mature at age 10.
<P></P>
 If a werewolf mates with a woman, the offspring is completely human. The
temperament reflects the father; such children are violent, combative, and prone to
mental illness. There is a 10% chance each year from the onset of adolescence
that such a child will spontaneously transform into a true werewolf.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Werewolves are a peculiar hybrid of human and lupine personalities. They are
savage killers, yet they are devoted to their close-knit families. Werewolves
are hostile toward lycanthropes who oppose them, especially werebears.
