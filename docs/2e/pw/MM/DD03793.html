</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Several of the monsters in this book have been imported from specialized game
worlds, such as the SPELLJAMMER® campaign setting, the FORGOTTEN REALMS®
setting, or the DARK SUN® world. The monsters in this book may be used in any
setting; if a campaign setting is noted, it simply describes where the monster was
first encountered, or where it is the most common. A particular monster still may
not be encountered in a specific campaign world; this is up to the DM. For
monsters from one of the specific worlds, the DM should consult the appropriate
MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM appendices.
