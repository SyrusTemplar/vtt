The displacer beast is a magical creature that resembles a puma with two
powerful black tentacles growing from its shoulders. Very rare, they stay far from
human habitations.
<P></P>
 The displacer beast has the blue-black coloring of a dark panther,and a long
cat-like body and head. Females range in length from 8 to 9 feet, and weigh 450
pounds; males are 10 to 12 feet long, and weigh up to 500 Lbs. They have 6
legs. Tentacles are tipped with rough horny edges that can inflict terrible wounds.
Their eyes glow bright green, even after death.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The displacer beast is a fierce, savage creature that hates all forms of life.
Highly aggressive, the displacer beast will attack on sight, using its
tentacles to inflict 2-8 (2d4) points of damage to its victims.
<P></P>
 Their main advantage in combat is their magical power of <I>displacement</I>, which allows them to appear to be some 3 feet from their actual location.
Anyone attacking a displacer beast does so at -2 on his attack roll. In addition,
the beasts save as 12th-level fighters; adding +2 to their die rolls.
<P></P>
 To determine the true position of the displacer beast and its illusion, roll
1d10. On 1-5, the illusion is in front of the creature, 6-7 to the creature's
left, 8-9, to the right. On 10, the illusion is behind the beasts actual
position. Although this ability is magical, the beast's location can not be determined
by <I>dispel</I> or<I> detect magic.</I> Only <I>true seeing</I> will reveal its position.
<P></P>
 Displacer beasts will not use their claws or teeth unless near death, or when
in combat with a very large opponent. If they do employ them, each claw does
1-3 points of damage, and each bite does 1-8 points of damage.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Displacer beasts are carnivores. Unless they are raising young, they usually
run in packs, carving a savage swath of destruction as they go. They hate all
life, and will sometimes kill purely for pleasure. Fierce and vicious as they
are, however, displacer beasts never fight among themselves. The pack is a
well-run and highly efficient killing machine. When encountered in packs, displacer
beasts are more than a match for many large creatures and have been known to make
a meal of orcs, goblins, and bands of men. Any creature entering their
territory is viewed as potential prey.
<P></P>
 Displacer beasts mate in the autumn, and the young are born in spring. A mated
pair of displacer beasts makes its home in a cave, producing litters of 1-4
young. The cubs, about the size of domestic cats, are born without tentacles and
reach maturity, though not full size, within 4 months. They remain in the cave
until their displacement abilities are fully developed. This is followed by a
two month period during which the cubs are taught how to hunt. When this is
completed, the family group disbands and the monsters wander off to join separate
packs. While raising young, the monsters are fiercely protective of their lairs.
One adult always remains with the cubs, usually the female, while the other
goes off to hunt. Dead prey is dragged back to the lair to be eaten by the
family. Lairs are littered with the bones, equipment, and the treasures of its
victims. 
<P></P>
 Naturally vicious and almost evil at times, displacer beasts harbor an undying
hatred of blink dogs. Many theories attempt to account for this enmity. Some
sages believe it springs from antipathy in temperaments -- the lawful good blink
dog would naturally be the enemy of a creature as savage and destructive as
the displacer beast. Others argue that it is the displacement and blink abilities
which cause this antipathy -- the two abilities, when in close proximity,
somehow stimulate the nervous system and produce hostile reactions. Encounters
between the two breeds are rare however, since they do not share the same territory.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Displacer beasts have little to fear from other large predators, save perhaps
trolls or giants. Some wizards and alchemists value their hides for use in
certain magical preparations, and will offer generous rewards for them. The eyes of
a displacer beast are a highly prized, if uncommon, good luck charms among
thieves who believe that they will protect the bearer from detection.
