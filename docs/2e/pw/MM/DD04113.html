  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">To avoid delays, create NPC parties before play. The 
   tables allow such parties to be set up quickly and impartially, and 
   the DM is encouraged to make any changes that will enhance play. The 
   tables should be considered a starting point.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">A typical NPC party has 2-12 members -- 2-5 major 
   characters and the rest henchmen or men-at-arms.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Characters:</B> The Character Subtable provides a 
   typical party structure by limiting number and classes of the NPC 
   characters encountered. Determine character race (20% demihuman) and 
   demihuman multiclasses on the Racial Subtable (multiclass results can 
   exceed the Character Subtable limits).</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Character Level and Equipment:</B> These will 
   usually be comparable to those of the player characters, but NPC 
   level will rarely exceed 12th. Arms, armor, and equipment will be 
   typical: a 1st level warrior would have scale or chain armor and 
   minimal gear. At 2nd level, banded or plate mail is typical, weapons 
   profuse, and equipment complete (much oil, holy water, mirrors, 
   etc.). NPC magic will be used if a fight breaks out. Note that if the 
   NPCs are defeated, their magical items will enter your campaign.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Character spells:</B> These are selected by the DM 
   according to those most suited to the NPC party. Wizards are subject 
   to the limits of spells known. Henchmen spellcasters are treated likewise.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Henchmen:</B> The major NPCs will have a total of 
   2-5 henchmen, up to the party size, with any remainder men-at-arms. 
   If the encounter is below the 3rd dungeon level, all those with the 
   major NPCs will be henchmen.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3">Henchman class and race is determined as for the major 
   characters. Major NPCs are assigned henchmen in order of Charisma, 
   allowing for compatibility (e.g., a paladin would not follow a thief, 
   nor would a ranger below 8th level have henchmen). A henchman's level 
   is one-third of that of his master (round up or down). If the 
   master's level is above 8th, the henchman has 1 additional level per 
   3 full levels of the master. Thus, a 5th level mage would have a 2nd 
   level henchman, while an 11th level mage would have a 5th level 
   henchman (4 + 1). Henchmen are armed much as major NPCs, though they 
   are not as heavily armored. Their magic is assigned as for major 
   NPCs, but is usually less powerful.</FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Men-at-Arms:</B> Little detail is needed for these 
   other than hit points. They often have poor armor and few weapons: 
   for example, studded leather, crossbow and dagger, or (at best) scale 
   mail, shield, spear, long sword, and backpack. They are seldom found 
   underground below the 3rd dungeon level.</FONT></P>
