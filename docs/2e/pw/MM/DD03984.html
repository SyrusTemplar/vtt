Wereboars are humans who are able to transform themselves into a form
combining human and boar features. Their tempers are as ugly as their features.
<P></P>
 In human form wereboars tend to be stocky, muscular people of average height.
Their hair is short and stiff. They dress in simple garments that are easy to
remove, repair, or replace.
<P></P>
 The boar form stands slightly taller than the human form, but the hunchbacked
posture thrusts the head forward. The head is identical to a boar's head,
complete with short tusks. The torso's diameter is doubled, the neck shortened, and
the feet become hoof-like. Stiff, black hair like wire bristles covers the skin.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The wereboar combines his hands and tusks for deadly effect. The wereboar
seizes a target and pulls it toward his head. He stabs his tusks into the victim,
then pulls his victim to one side while swinging his head in the other
direction, which tears the wound further. He then tosses the victim aside and attacks
someone else. A wereboar will gladly wade into the center of a group of opponents
and then fight his way out.
<P></P>
 In human form the wereboar attacks with whatever weapon he has. Wereboars
prefer bludgeoning or chopping weapons, such as axes and maces, rather than
stabbing or missile weapons such as swords, spears, or bows.
<P></P>
 In either form the wereboar is immune to damage from nonmagical and nonsilver
weapons. Such wounds are little more than scratches that quickly heal.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Wereboars are ill-tempered, easily angered, and almost as prone to attack
their few friends as they are to attack an enemy. As humans they are rude, crude,
and vulgar. However, they are invaluable allies in a fight. A wereboar does not
give his friendship easily, but when he does it is a special bond he will not
break. The problem is, due to the wereboar's peculiar personality, it is
difficult to tell whether he is being friendly or hostile.
<P></P>
 Wereboars prefer dense woodlands, ideally far from towns and cities. Like
werebears, they live in caves or build cabins for their homes. Their homes tend to
be ill-kept and slovenly. Wereboars don't repair things, they replace them.
<P></P>
 Despite their personalities, wereboars have close-knit families. Females give
birth to litters of 1d4+2 offspring. Newborns are very small by human standards
but are strong and able to crawl hours after birth. The offspring mature
quickly. When they reach adolescence at eight years, they gain the ability to become
wereboars themselves. A wereboar father appears to be distant and aloof, but a
staunch protector who will attack any foe who threatens his family, no matter
how uneven the odds. Females are aggressive when defending their young (+2
bonus to attack roll). Neither males nor females check morale when defending their
young.
<P></P>
 The diet is a mixture of small game, vegetables, and fungi. Their favorite
food is the subterranean fungus called truffles; even in human form they can
detect the truffles growing several feet underground. Wereboars aren't very good
gardeners. A typical garden is a cleared field strewn with a variety of seeds and
bulbs in the hope that something edible will grow. Wereboar cuisine is equally
haphazard; it can be summed up as burned meat and stews.
<P></P>
 Wereboars avoid normal hogs and boars. They are suspicious of strangers.
Wereboars assume everyone is hostile. In human form they may wait for the first
attack, but when in boar form they usually (75% chance) chase the intruders away
and attack any who defend themselves.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Wereboars produce little of value, whether trade goods or services. Their main
desire is simply to stay away from everyone else. In the wild, they defend
their territories against any intruders. Wereboars fit into orcish society as well
as they do into human society, and might sometimes assist or ally themselves
with orcish forces. Wereboars can tolerate half-orcs.
