Reef giants are the loners of giant-kind, although they often live in
remarkably well-appointed mansions that seem to be no more than huts from the outside.
They sometimes become sailors, but their huge mass limits them to the largest
of vessels. Reef giants are typically 16' tall and weigh 4,000 pounds. Reef
giants can live to be 600 years old.
<P></P>
 Reef giants speak their own language as well as the giantish trade tongue and
the languages of storm and cloud giants. In addition, 40% of the giants also
speak the common tongue.
<P></P>
 Reef giants have burnished coppery skin and pale white hair. They are
barrel-chested and powerfully-muscled from the exertion of forcing their huge bodies
through water. Reef giants have a Strength of 22. Reef giants wear skins or
garments made of braided hair when ashore, but swim wearing no more than a belt for
knives and pouches.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Reef giants prefer to fight in or under water, and they are fierce fighters
when angered. They suffer no penalties when fighting in or under water. They
cannot be harmed by water- or ice-based attack forms. They typically attack with
giant tridents for 2-20 +10 points of damage, but have been known to lash out
with a huge fist (1d10 points damage) now and again.
<P></P>
 Once per day, a reef giant can form a whirlpool. Unless a successful Strength
ability check is made, creatures within 10 yards of the giant are sucked into
the whirlpool and suffer 2-16 points of battering damage plus 2-20 points
drowning and choking damage (unless the creatures are able to breathe water, in which
case only the battering damage applies). The whirlpool is not powerful enough
to draw in ships.
<P></P>
 Reef giants can throw boulders up to 350 yards for 3-30 (3d10) points of
damage. They prefer to use thrown boulders to sink unwelcome ships. Boulders are not
used against individual opponents.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Reef giants are often solitary for long periods of time, although they mate
for life. When their children reach puberty, they are sent out on their own to
seek an island or reef habitat to make their home.
<P></P>
 The mansions of reef giants are sometimes built into the hills and gorges of
the islands, and they are always stocked with furniture and decorations
collected over generations. These mansions are passed on from one giant to another; the
eldest daughter is generally reared to provide for her parents as they grow
old and is usually given the mansion and all its goods upon their death. These
well-dowried daughters are the objects of much competition between reef giant
suitors, each of whom seeks to both prove himself to the new mistress of the
mansion and undo his competitors by any means available. Diving, surfing, and
fishing competitions are common in reef giant courtship.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Reef giants are scavengers who fish and forage coral reefs for a hundred
different sources of food. They can net entire schools of fish, and as accomplished
divers they can retrieve hoards of pearls, sponges, and coral. Their enormous
strength allows them to swim for hours at a time without tiring. In this way
reef giants can amass huge amounts of goods to trade for other items.
<P></P>
 Some reef giants keep flocks of goats or sheep on their island homes, but
these giants are generally elderly and not as capable of foraging successfully.
<P></P>
 Reef giants frequently enter into contracts or trade agreements with humans
and other mercantile races. In exchange for pearls and other valuables from the
sea, they are given cloth, sweets, and metal goods.
<P></P>
 The reef giants willingness to plunder the sea has made them the enemies of
merfolk, tritons, and other ocean-dwelling races.
