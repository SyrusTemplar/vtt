The bullywugs are a race of bipedal, frog-like amphibians. They inhabit
swamps, marshes, meres, or other dank places.
<P></P>
 Bullywugs are covered with smooth, mottled olive green hide  that is
reasonably tough, giving them a natural AC of 6. They can vary in size from smaller than
the average human to about seven feet in height. Their faces resemble those of
enormous frogs, with wide mouths and large, bulbous eyes; their feet and hands
are webbed. Though they wear no clothing, all bullywugs use weapons, armor,
and shields if they are available. Bullywugs have their own language and the more
intelligent ones can speak a limited form of the common tongue.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Bullywugs always attack in groups, trying to use their numbers to surround
their enemies. Whenever they can, bullywugs attack with their hop, which can be
up to 30 feet forward and 15 feet upward. When attacking with a hop, bullywugs
add a +1 bonus to their attack (not damage) rolls, and double the damage if
using an impaling weapon. This skill, combined with their outstanding camouflage
abilities, frequently puts the bullywugs in an ideal position for an ambush (-2
penalty to opponent's surprise rolls).
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> More intelligent than frogs, all bullywugs live in organized or
semi-organized socially fascist groups, cooperating for the purpose of hunting and survival.
They live primarily on fish and any other game, preferring a diet of meat.
They are adept hunters and fisherman, and skilled in the use and construction of
snares and nets.
<P></P>
 Bullywug society is a savage one. Males are the dominant sex, and females
exist only to lay eggs. Though females and young make up about one-half of any
tribe, they count for little in the social order. The only signs of respect that
bullywugs ever
<P></P>
bestow are toward their leader and their bizarre frog god. The race is chaotic
evil, and totally lacking in any higher emotions or feelings.
<P></P>
 The leader of a bullywug community is a large individual with 8 hit points.
Communities of 30 or more bullywugs have five subleaders (8 hp each) and a
powerful leader (2 HD, 12+ hp, +1 to damage). Communities of 60 or more bullywugs
have a chieftain (3 HD, 20+ hp, +2 to damage) and five subchieftains (2 HD, 12+
hp, +1 to damage).
<P></P>
 All bullywugs favor dank, dark places to live, since they must keep their skin
moist. Most bullywugs live in the open and maintain only loose territorial
boundaries. Ordinary bullywugs do not deal with incursions into their territory
very efficiently, but they kill and eat interlopers if they can. They hate their
large relatives (advanced bullywugs, see below) with a passion, and make war
upon them at every opportunity. Bullywugs prize treasure, though it benefits them
little. They value coins and jewels, and occasionally a magical item can be
found amongst their hoard.
<P></P>
 On an individual level, bullywugs lack the greed and powerlust seen in the
individuals of other chaotic races, such as orcs. Fighting among members of the
same group, for example, is almost nonexistent. Some would say that this is
because they lack the intelligence to pick a fight, and not from a lack of spite.
The tribes are lead by the dominant male, who kills and eats the previous leader
when it is too old to rule. This is one of the few instances when they fight
among themselves.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Bullywugs tend to disrupt ecosystems, rather than fill a niche in them. They
do not have the intelligence to harvest their food supplies sensibly and will
fish and hunt in an area until its natural resources are depleted, and then move
on to a new territory. They hate men, and will attack them on sight, but
fortunately prefer to dwell in isolated regions far from human beings.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Bullywug, Advanced
<P></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A small number of bullywugs are larger and more intelligent than the rest of
their kind. These bullywugs make their homes in abandoned buildings and caves,
and send out regular patrols and hunting parties. These groups tend to be well
equipped and organized, and stake out a regular territory, which varies with the
size of the group. They are more aggressive than their smaller cousins, and
will fight not only other bullywugs but other monsters as well. The intelligent
bullywugs also organize regular raids outside their territory for food and
booty, and especially prize human flesh. Since they are chaotic evil, all
trespassers, including other bullywugs, are considered threats or sources of food.
<P></P>
 For every 10 advanced bullywugs in a community, there is a 10% chance of a
2nd-level shaman being present.
