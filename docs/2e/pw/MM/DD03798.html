The arcane are a race of merchants, found wherever there is potential trade in
magical items. They appear as tall, lanky, blue giants with elongated faces
and thin fingers; each finger having one more joint than is common in most
humanoid life. The arcane dress in robes, although there are individuals who are
found in heavier armor, a combination of chain links with patches of plate (AC 3).
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">For creatures of their size, the arcane are noticeably weak and non-combative.
They can defend themselves when called upon, but prefer to talk and/or buy
themselves out of dangerous situations. If entering an area that is potentially
dangerous (like most human cities), the arcane hires a group of adventurers as
his entourage.
<P></P>
 The arcane can become <I>invisible,</I> and can <I>dimension door</I> up to three times a day, usually with the intention of avoiding combat. An
arcane feels no concern about abandoning his entourage in chancy situations. They
can also use any magical items, regardless of the limitations of those items.
This includes swords, wands, magical tomes, and similar items restricted to one
type of character class. They will use such items if pressed in combat and
they cannot escape, but more often use them as bartering tools with others.
<P></P>
 Arcane have a form of racial telepathy, such that an injury to one arcane is
immediately known by all other arcane. The arcane do not seek vengeance against
the one who hurt or killed their fellow. They react negatively to such
individuals, and dealing with the arcane will be next to impossible until that
individual makes restitution.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Nothing is known about the arcane's origins; they come and go as they please,
and are found throughout the known worlds. When they travel, they do so on the
ships and vehicles of other races. Finding such ships with arcane aboard is
rare, and it is suspected that the arcane have another way of travelling over long
distances.
<P></P>
 Contacting the arcane is no trouble in most civilized areas: a few words
spread through the local grapevine, through taverns, guilds, and barracks, are
enough to bring one of these creatures to the surface. In game terms, there is a
base 10% chance per day of finding an arcane, if PCs actively look for one; the
chance increases or decreases depending on their location. Arcane never set up
permanent &quot;magic shops.&quot;
<P></P>
 The arcane's stock in trade is to provide magical items, particularly <I>spelljamming helms,</I> which allow rapid movement through space. The arcanes' high quality and
uniform (if high) prices make them the trusted retailers. They accept payment in
gold, or barter for other magical items (as a rule of thumb, costs should be five
times the XP reward of the item, or a more valuable item).
<P></P>
 The arcane take no responsibility for the use of the items they sell. The
arcane will deal with almost anyone. They often make deals with both sides in a
conflict, fully aware that they might annihilate all of their potential customers
in a region. The arcane have no dealings with neogi, nor with creatures from
other planes, such as genies, tanar'ri, and fiends. It is unknown whether the
arcane create a wide variety of magical devices, or secure them from an unknown
source.
<P></P>
 Those dealing with the arcane find them cool, efficient, and most importantly,
uncaring. Trying to haggle with an arcane is a chancy business, at best.
Sometimes they will engage in haggling with a bemused smirk, but just as often leave
the buyer hanging and walk out on the negotiations. They do not like being
threatened, insulted, or blackmailed. Those who do so will find it very difficult
to purchase reliable equipment. An arcane will not raise his hand in vengeance
or anger -- there are more subtle ways to wreak revenge.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">It is not known what arcane do with the gold, gems, and magic they collect.
One theory says they need the items for reproduction (the basis for a large
number of bawdy arcane jokes), while another links it to production and acquisition
of more magical items. The arcane seem sexless. No young arcane have been
reported, and the arcane keep their own counsel.
