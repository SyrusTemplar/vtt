Werebears are humans who can transform themselves into large brown bears. They
are the best known good-aligned lycanthropes. The ursine form most often
resembles a brown bear. Some have blond, reddish, black, or ivory fur (the latter is
common in frozen regions).
<P></P>
 In human form they are large, stout, well-muscled, and hairy. Their brown hair
is thick; males usually wear beards. Some have reddish, blond, ivory, or black
hair; this matches the color of the ursine form. They dress in simple cloth
and leather garments that are easily removed, repaired, or replaced.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">In human form, the werebear uses available weapons, preferring axes, and
knives, since these have practical applications suitable for woodland life. If
attacked in daylight, the werebear usually remains human unless death is likely. The
shapechange renders the werebear helpless for a round. In ursine form, the
werebear attacks with two swiping claws and a bite. If both claws hit, during the
next round the werebear can hug for an additional 2-16 points of damage. This
subsequent damage continues automatically each round thereafter.
<P></P>
 Like those of other lycanthropes, the werebear's defenses function only in the
bear form. Weapons used against the werebear must be either silver or magical
weapons of +1 or better. Werebears can summon 1-6 brown bears within 2-12
turns, provided such animals are within one mile. Werebears heal at three times the
normal human rate and can <I>cure disease</I> in another creature in 1-4 weeks if they so desire.
<P></P>
 If a werebear dies, he reverts to his human form in one round.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Werebears are normally solitary creatures. As humans, they build cabins far
from settled areas, preferably in a deep forest near well-stocked waters.
Werebears do not marry although they may have preferred mates they meet on a very
irregular basis. Females bear 1-2 children in human form. Such children are very
stout and grow quickly. Within eight years they gain adolescence and the ability
to change into werebears. Shortly after, the mother drives the children out
and seeks a mate to start the cycle anew. The newly independent young are
discreetly guided and assisted by older werebears. Despite their apparent isolationism
and rugged individualism, werebears have a sense of community. They never
attack each other and aid any werebear threatened by another lycanthrope species.
<P></P>
 Werebears are closest to forest-dwelling classes like rangers, druids, and
wildlife-oriented priests. They rarely enter villages and never enter cities
except in dire emergencies or to help other good-aligned people, especially those
threatened by evil lycanthropes. Werebears hate wererats and werewolves.
<P></P>
 The average werebear claims a territory 1 to 4 square miles in size. Fishing
areas are open to all werebears. A werebear feels a close bond to its home
region, acting as a game warden to protect its territory and the animals therein
from the ravages of intruders.
<P></P>
 Werebears do not travel a great deal. Only the rare individual (usually young)
can be coaxed into joining a band of adventurers. Werebears may join an
adventuring group as guides, provided the money is right and the job is agreeable.
<P></P>
 Treasure is usually limited to small, valuable commodities like gold,
platinum, gems, and jewelry. Werebears rarely carry any treasure and instead hide it
near their homes. They also collect scrolls, potions, and other magical items,
often as fees or rewards for past services. Werebears destroy any magical items
that specifically affect lycanthropes or bears, since such items might be used
against themselves.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Werebears are omnivorous, preferring fish, small mammals, and a honey-rich
mead. This mead is extremely intoxicating to normal humans. Werebears have few
natural enemies. Their closest enemies are the werewolves who share their
preferred wilderness regions.
