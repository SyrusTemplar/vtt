<P></P>
Titans are gargantuan, almost godlike men and woman. They, quite simply, look
like 25' tall people of great physical strength and beauty. They are commonly
dressed in traditional Greek garb, favoring togas, loincloths, and such. They
wear rare and valuable jewelry and in other ways make themselves seem beautiful
and overpowering.
<P></P>
 In addition to speaking their own language, titans are able to speak the six
main dialects of giants. All titans are also conversant in the common tongue as
well as that commonly spoken by forest creatures, as these giants have close
ties with nature.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Combat:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The basic attack of titans is their great maul (<I>maul of the titans</I>). These monstrous beings are capable of attacking twice in a melee round and
inflicting 7-42 points of damage per hit.
<P></P>
 Titans may choose to make a single other attack in a round. This form of
special attack is so destructive and deadly, that a titan will use it only if there
are no other options left open. The form of each titan's attack will be
different (some kick, some punch, others use a breath attack, lightning, etc.), but
the effect is the same for each. The special attack inflicts 10-60 points of
damage per hit and can be used every other round. These mighty attacks have been
known to destroy buildings and sink ships.
<P></P>
 Titans can become ethereal twice per day. All titans are able to employ both
mage or priest spells (dependent on the individual titan -- only one, not both)
as a 20th-level spell caster. In addition, all titans have the following
spell-like powers, at 20th level of spell use, usable once per round, one at a time,
at will:

<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Habitat/Society:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Titans are livers of life, creators of fate. These benevolent giants are
closer to the well springs of life than mere mortals and, as such, revel in their
gigantic existences. Titans are wild and chaotic. They are prone to more
pronounced emotions that humans and can experience godlike fits of rage. They are,
however, basically good and benevolent, so they tend not to take life. They are
very powerful creatures and will fight with ferocity when necessary.
<P></P>
 To some, titans seem like gods. With their powers they can cause things to
happen that, surely, only a god could. They are fiery and passionate, displaying
emotions with greater purity and less reservation than mortal beings. Titans are
quick to anger, but quicker still to forgive. In fits of rage they destroy
mountains and in moments of passion will create empires. They are in all ways
godlike and in all ways larger than life.
<P></P>
 And yet is should be noted that titans are not gods. They are beings that make
their home in Olympus and walk among the gods. Yet they are not omnipotent,
omniscient rulers of the planes. Sometimes their godlike passions and godlike
rages make them seem like deities, however, and it is common for whole
civilizations to mistake them for deities.
<P></P>
 In one society, Jeuron, a titan with dominion over knowledge, was revered as a
god for centuries. Those mortals built their whole civilization around him and
Jeuron revelled in the worship. He even walked among them occasionally to see
their love and admiration. But Odin, of the Norse mythos, discovered his
deception and punished Jeuron by shackling him to the bottom of the deepest sea for
100 years.
<P></P>
 Titans have a natural affinity for storm giants. Those giants are the closest
beings the titans have found to peers and they will readily befriend them. In
any group of titans, there is a 35% chance that they will be accompanied by one
or more storm giants. Although titans can sometimes be condescending by nature,
they never treat the storm giants as subordinates or inferiors.
<P></P>
 On Olympus, titans have developed a culture similar to what they found there.
They wear similar clothing, eat similar foods, play similar music, etc. It is
unclear why this has occurred. Perhaps the titans, in a godlike whim, adopted
their favorite mortal lifestyle. Such would not be unusual for these great beings.
<P></P>
 Titans primarily dwell in great palaces and mansions in Olympus where they
live their lives whimsically. There they will dance, sing, study, debate and
engage in all other manner of activities with titanic proportion. If a titan finds
something that interests him, it would not be unusual for him to study it in
great detail for many weeks, only to leave it when his interest has waned. They
may also engage in debates or arguments that last literally for weeks at a time.
These debates might end in a jovial laughter and good spirits or in thunder and
rage. Such are the whims of titans.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Ecology:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Titans are basically identical to humans, except much larger. What makes them
immortal is not known. Perhaps it is their enchanted existence in the halls of
Olympus.
<P></P>
 These giants are commonly known to experience the same range of emotions as
humans do. They develop idiosyncrasies as humans do, also. In fact, titan
mannerisms emulate those of humans very closely. Again, it is difficult to tell if the
titans are whimsically copying humans, or vice versa.
<P></P>

<P></P>
 Titans, being godlike creatures, tend to be very diverse and unique. Each
individual titan (or sometimes group of titans) have a special power is that
related to their personality or sphere of influence. These powers are very different,
and usually very strong. Some examples of the powers of a titan are explained
below:
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Algorn</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, a titan that has influence over the seas, has the ability to <I>create water</I> whenever he chooses to. This water can be  vast as he desires, up to the volume of a medium-sized lake. Algorn can simply
cause the water to flow, he can cause it to jet out from his hands (washing
away everything in its path away), or he can even cause the water to be frozen.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Mane</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, a titan with dominion over felines, has the ability to change into a giant
form of any cat. When he transforms, he is instantly cured of all wounds,
poisons, and diseases. Mane may change into a cat and back again five times per day.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Porphyl</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> is a titan with the power of growth. He may cause any immature life to grow
to maturity. Thus, he can cause crops to grow, he can make a boy grow to
manhood, etc. Porphyl is very wise and would never abuse his ability.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Malephus</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, a titan with influence over law and justice can unerringly detect any spoken
lie and any bad intention. He is often used by many greater powers in trials
of justice. Malephus is totally honest; he is incapable of lies or deception.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Syllia</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, a titan with power over love, can remove any negative feelings from any
being (except deities and powers). She has the ability to remove hatred,
unhappiness, depression, etc. Syllia cannot remove the feeling permanently, but for at
least a day or so. The deities of the upper planes often employ her power when
trying to stop wars.
<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Girzon</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">, a titan with dominion over death, can take the life from any living being.
It should be noted that Girzon has never used  this ability unless commanded to by a deity. Girzon's restraint and
self-control is revered by other titans.
<P></P>

<P></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#000080" SIZE="3"><B>Greater Titans:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Rumors exist of a race of titans more powerful still than common titans. These <I>greater</I> titans are said to be very close to the gods and always accompany one (with
some deities and powers being attended by more than one greater titan). Perhaps
greater titans were formally common titans who have grown so great in power
that the gods brought them closer to themselves. Such matters are not common
knowledge.
<P></P>
 It is very difficult to provide combat statistics for greater titans. Like the
gods themselves, greater titans are simply not subject to aggression from
nondivine beings. They are never harmed by such attacks.
<P></P>
