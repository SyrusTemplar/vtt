 This unusual weapon consists of an iron helmet with a large (1 to 2 foot)
spike on the top, sometimes called a &quot;belly skewer.&quot; A fighter employs this weapon
when charging. Running, bent forward, he attempts to spear his opponent in the
stomach. The attack roll is made at a -3 penalty, and he loses any armor class
benefits high Dexterity may give him. If he impales his enemy, he scores double
damage.
