 The Vindicator is imbued with the spiritual power of his deity. When this
power is manifested, he becomes a fearless and powerful warrior. He is able to
enter a rage similar to that experienced by Battleragers; his face becomes
contorted and he grinds his teeth together. See Battlerager for details concerning
changes in appearance.

10, and Wisdom no higher than 14.
