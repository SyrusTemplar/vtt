 Pest Controllers keep a stronghold free from rats, giant spiders, centipedes,
carrion crawlers, kobolds, and other pests. They are experts at setting traps
and in eradicating minor animal and monster nuisances.
<P></P>
 <B>Role:</B> Pest Controllers are members of the Pest Control Guild. Through experience
they learn all of a stronghold's tunnels, passages, and sewers. Although they
perform an invaluable service keeping underground settlements habitable, their
true worth becomes apparent when a stronghold is under attack. Then they use their
expertise to rig traps along passages of expected enemy advance to slow and
kill the invaders. Enemies entering a dwarf stronghold are likely to find their
way beset with deadly traps.

    As members of an adventuring party, Pest Controllers are useful to protect the
party's camp area and to find and disarm traps set by others.
