A special plant grows there\u2014a plant whose flowers bloom in both worlds. These flowers can be used to cross between worlds if you perform a certain ritual. A key component of this ritual is blood from a monstrosity (a type of creature). The thessalhydra is a monstrosity, so it can use its own blood to open a gateway.",
								"The Proud Princess can point them to the cavern where the flowers grow, but if the characters want to open a gateway, they'll also need the blood of a monstrosity. Luckily, she knows of one that has been stalking around the Upside Down lately: a {@creature demogorgon|HftT}!",
								"She tells them that the demogorgon is attracted to the smell of blood. The easiest way to get its attention is to spill blood on the ground. But since there are so few creatures in the Upside Down, the only source is the characters themselves. Using a weapon carefully, a character can do minor damage (cutting their palm) causing 1 hp of damage and spilling a small amount of blood. If the group spills a total of 3 hp worth of blood, the demogorgon will arrive {@dice 1d6} minutes later, leaping from the darkness and attacking the group.",
								"If the characters don't want to spill their own blood, they can stalk the demogorgon, but this is very difficult. One character should try a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check for the group. If this is successful, they have found the demogorgon. If it fails, the group may try again (with the same character or a different one making the check). If the group fails three times, the demogorgon has found them and attacks, but the characters are surprised (see chapter 2 of the rulebook for how surprise works)."

One currently lives in the Upside Down, and no one knows where it came from originally. It's incredibly strong and can heal itself from damage it takes (even here in the Upside Down). Like a shark, a demogorgon is drawn to the scent of blood, and goes into a frenzy when blood is near.",

For example, they can get blood off a sword blade immediately after it strikes and damages the creature (they must do this four times to get enough blood)."
