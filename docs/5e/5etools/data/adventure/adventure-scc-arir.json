If {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} survives the ritual's premature end, the characters have a choice to make. They can take him back to Strixhaven to stand trial for his crimes, or they can administer justice themselves.",

Professor Sharpbeak tells the characters that the faculty plans to honor the heroes on their graduation day with a celebration attended by their Friends, Beloveds, and even Rivals. The faculty also offers each character a token of gratitude, in the form of a rare or uncommon magic item of the character's choice."

								"If all the characters fall {@condition unconscious} or die in the final encounter, they fail to stop {@creature Murgaxor|SCC}'s ritual. Shortly afterward, the ritual deals 70 ({@dice 20d6}) necrotic damage to everyone on campus as {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} siphons their life force. Hundreds of scholars die, and many more are severely injured. {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} becomes immortal and one of the most powerful spellcasters in the world. If the characters survive, perhaps the Founder Dragons and the archaics can guide them as they attempt to stop {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} in a dystopian new world."
