				"Welcome to {@i Tales from the Yawning Portal}. Within this book you will find seven of the deadliest dungeons from the history of D&D, updated for the current edition of the game. Some are classics that have hosted an untold number of adventurers, while others are newer creations boldly staking their place in the pantheon of notable D&D adventures.",
				"Just as these dungeons have made an impression on D&D players, so too have tales of their dangers spread across the D&D multiverse. When the night grows long in Waterdeep, City of Splendors, and the fireplace in the taproom of the Yawning Portal dims to a deep crimson, adventurers from across the Sword Coast-and even some visiting from other D&D worlds-spin tales and rumors of lost treasures.",

The key elements remain the same in each version of the tales, lending a thread of truth to the tale.",

						"Amid the bustle of Waterdeep, within the Castle Ward where barristers, nobles, and emissaries battle with word and contract, stands an inn not quite like any other. Before there was a Castle Ward or even what could be recognized as an ancestor of the City of Splendors, there was a dungeon, and in that dungeon begins the tale of the Yawning Portal.",
						"In ages past, the mighty wizard Halaster built his tower at the foot of Mount Waterdeep and delved deep into tunnels first built by dwarves and drow in search of ever greater magical power. Halaster and his apprentices expanded the tunnels they found, worming out new lairs under the surface for reasons of their own. In time, their excavations grew into the vast labyrinth known today as Undermountain, the largest dungeon in all of the Forgotten Realms. Halaster eventually disappeared, as have all his apprentices, but the massive complex he built remains to this day.",
						"For untold years, the secrets of Undermountain remained hidden from the surface world. Everyone who entered its halls failed to return. Its reputation as a death trap grew to the point that criminals in Waterdeep who were sentenced to die were forcibly escorted into the dungeon and left to fend for themselves.",
						"All of that changed with the arrival of two men, a warrior named Durnan and a ne'er-do-well named Mirt. The duo were the first adventurers to return from Undermountain, laden with riches and magic treasures. While Mirt used his wealth to buy a mansion, Durnan had different plans. Durnan retired from adventuring and purchased the land on which sat the deep, broad well that was the only known entrance to the dungeon. Around this well he built a tavern and inn that caters to adventurers and those who seek their services, and he called it the Yawning Portal.",
						"Some of the magic Durnan looted on his successful foray into Undermountain granted him a life span that exceeds even that of an elf. And for decades Durnan left delving into Undermountain to younger folk. Yet one day, something drew him back. Days of waiting for his triumphant return from the dungeon turned to months and then years. For nearly a century, citizens of Waterdeep thought him dead. But one night, a voice called up from the well. Few at first believed it could be Durnan, but folk as long-lived as he vouched it so. The Yawning Portal had passed into the hands of his ancestors, but Durnan returned with enough riches for them to quietly retire. Durnan took his customary place behind the bar, raised a toast to his own safe return, and then began serving customers as if he'd never left.",
						"Adventurers from across Faer√ªn, and even from elsewhere in the great span of the multiverse, visit the Yawning Portal to exchange knowledge about Undermountain and other dungeons. Most visitors are content to swap stories by the hearth, but sometimes a group driven by greed, ambition, or desperation pays the toll for entry and descends the well.

Paranoia and suspicion run rampant here, as befits a free city that stands at the nexus between a devil-haunted empire, a vast domain locked in the irontight grip of a demigod of evil, and a splintered, bickering host of kingdoms nominally committed to justice and weal.

Death and destruction have been laid heavily upon every place these monsters have visited. This has caused great anger in high places, for life and property loss means failure of the vows of noble rulers to protect the life and goods of each and every subject-and possible lean times for the rulers as well as the ruled. Therefore, a party of the bravest and most powerful adventurers has been assembled and given the charge to punish the miscreant giants. Characters whose homes lay in the devastated land probably need little more motivation to face their oppressors.",
						"The first stage of the characters' mission is an infiltration and assault of the Steading of the Hill Giant Chief.

Note that if the giants here have learned of the fate that befell the hill giants, or if survivors from the steading reached them, they will be on the alert. Furthermore, the frost giants will organize traps, ambushes, and last-ditch defenses against continuing forays into their stronghold, taking full advantage of the treacherous terrain (ice slides, rigging tunnels to collapse on the party, and so forth). They will also make active efforts to locate the characters' base of operations (winter wolves make good trackers) and, if successful, attack it at the most inopportune time.

						"It is assumed that the party has either followed the map obtained at the steading or used the magical chain found there to arrive in the neighborhood of the glacial rift. If they spend a few hours searching the area, they discover a hidden cave in which they can safely hide themselves, their mounts, equipment, and even treasure if they take minimum precautions with respect to keeping their hiding place secret (do not lead pursuers to the spot, allow a light to show, make undue noise there, etc.). In any event, the same search will also reveal the rift.",
						"The party can travel on the surface of the glacier-mountain (over the caves shown) to circumvent the whole rift if they so desire. Ropes can be lowered to gain the ledges below-a distance of some 50 to 150 feet depending on position. Every hour the party moves along the icy terrain, randomly choose one character to make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the check fails, the character slips and falls. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character goes over the edge of the rift. The whole place is windy and very cold. Visibility atop the rift is about 150 feet. The wind at the bottom of the rift is worse still, and visibility there is only 30 feet. The floor of the rift is a maze of snow and ice hillocks and mounds, with peaks of ice and rock thrusting up here and there like fangs. All movement in the rift is hampered by this difficult terrain. Due to wind force and eddying currents, attempts at levitation or flying cause movement in a random direction equal to half the distance traveled (use a d8 to determine direction: 1 north, 2 northeast, 3 east, and so on).",
						"If the party is on the floor of the rift and fleeing from pursuing monsters, the blizzard-like conditions in this area makes the characters hard to catch. The characters have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to evade pursuit. At the same time, winter wolves are considered to have passive Perception scores 4 higher than normal when they are pursuing the characters.",
