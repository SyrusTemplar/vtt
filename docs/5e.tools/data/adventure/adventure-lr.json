He was embittered by a life of suffering at the hands of others: pirates killed his family when he was young, he was forced into servitude aboard a merchant ship, and then another band of pirates left him to die on the open sea, where he lost his arm to a shark. Gar saw the elemental power of water as the only thing of value in his life and gathered others who felt similarly.",
								"Gar wielded the elemental weapon Drown, a magical trident of great power, and his missing arm was replaced by an artificial limb in the shape of a crab's claw. As the leader of Olhydra's cult, he could channel her innate magic, which inspired awe and fear in the other Crushing Wave cultists.",

He faced Olhydra's displeasure, expecting to be destroyed by her wrath, and was astonished to awaken several years later, floating off the coast of Turmish in the Sea of Fallen Stars. He gripped a trident in one hand, though it was not Drown.",
								"Gar discovered that the ancient weapon had been gifted to him by the sea goddess Umberlee who, in conjunction with Olhydra, managed to reinstate the prophet with power even more formidable than he previously enjoyed. The seas and the storms that raged above now heeded his commands, and\u2014free of the original compact made with the other prophets\u2014Gar could seek success unburdened by any past commitments.",

There he opened a rift, drew on its power, and created a place where ships would be destroyed and dragged beneath the waves.",
