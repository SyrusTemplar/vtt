				"A terrible threat gathers in the North. Throughout this region of the Forgotten Realms, savage marauders bring destruction. Monsters are on the prowl, preying on flocks, rampaging through croplands, and attacking homesteads and travelers. In settlements, discord and suspicion grow. Sinister strangers lurk in the shadows, whispering about how everything is soon to change. This year brought an unseasonably warm and stormy spring. Tales spread of flooding, windstorms, wildfires, and tremors.",
				"These troubles have a source known to few in the North: Elemental Evil. Servants of this malevolence gather in the Sumber Hills and spy on the Dessarin Valley, drawn by a force they cant explain. Dabbling in dangerous lore, these fanatics seek to master elemental magic and unleash its destructive power everywhere. And they are further along in their plans than most people in the North realize.",
				"Four elemental cults grow in power in the Sumber Hills, claiming abandoned keeps that connect to an underground fortress once part of an ancient dwarven kingdom. Within those chambers are the remnants of a temple built by drow worshipers of Elemental Evil. Each of the four cults venerates a powerful entity of air, earth, fire, or water: a Prince of Elemental Evil. Like their princes, the four cults are rivals, yet they all serve a mysterious force they call the Elder Elemental Eye.",
				"A prophet gifted with a powerful elemental weapon leads each cult. Those weapons {@item Windvane|PotA}, {@item Ironfang|PotA}, {@item Tinderstrike|PotA}, and {@item Drown|PotA} were the catalysts for the creation of four elemental nodes, places where the Elemental Planes connect to the Material Plane. The cults draw elemental creatures through the nodes, and they use elemental magic to create devastation orbs capable of ravaging the countryside. They've been testing these magic weapons, bolstering the cults ranks, and infiltrating various communities, all directed by visions the prophets receive from the Elder Elemental Eye. In time, each prophet hopes to entice his or her elemental prince to pass through the node and wreak devastation on the Dessarin Valley and beyond.",

						"{@i Princes of the Apocalypse} presents an epic campaign against the forces of Elemental Evil that can occupy you and your players for many months. Characters who are at least 3rd level can dive right into the main adventure. A party of 1st- or 2nd-level characters should start with the mini-adventure in chapter 6.",
						"This chapter provides the background of Elemental Evils appearance in the campaign, and a synopsis of the adventure. The four elemental cults, which serve as the primary foes of the campaign, are also described in this chapter. Although the cults are all linked by their hunger for power and proclivity for destruction, each has its own leader and preferred methods. Further, this chapter offers guidelines for starting and running the adventure.",
						"Chapter 2 explores the Dessarin Valley, the setting for this adventure (and many others, if you wish). The Dessarin River, one of the mighty waterways of the North, runs through a barely settled frontier region a few days travel from the great city of Waterdeep. A handful of small towns and outposts are scattered through the region, linked to more populous lands by ancient roads and the broad river. The heart of this area, the Sumber Hills, has become the stronghold where the elemental cults build their bases of power.",
						"Chapter 3 begins the adventure in earnest. In this chapter, the characters learn that trouble has taken root in the Dessarin Valley and that evil forces are on the loose. By exploring, the characters find the first outposts of the four elemental cults-the so-called Haunted Keeps.",
						"In chapter 4, the characters discover that the four cults occupy a sprawling dungeon complex beneath the Sumber Hills. The temples serve as the base for the cultists insidious attacks against the Dessarin Valley.",
						"Chapter 5 describes the ancient caverns beneath the temple complex and the altar dedicated to Elemental Evil. From these caverns, passages lead to four elemental nodes, places where forces from Elemental Planes have established a foothold in the world. Within each node, a portal to one of those planes grows in intensity. The characters must destroy the cults there before the Princes of Elemental Evil are unleashed upon the world.",
						"Chapter 6 presents adventures that are secondary to the main storyline. Use them as you see fit. Some are especially useful if you start the adventure with 1st-level characters.",
						"Chapter 7 details NPCs, new monsters, and new magic items.",
						"Appendixes A and B contain new material for players to use in creating their characters for the campaign. Appendix C provides advice for adapting this adventure to other D&D campaign settings."

						"The threat of Elemental Evil surfaces in different worlds of the multiverse whenever the force known as the Elder Elemental Eye tests its strength. In its current incarnation, Elemental Evil arises in the Sumber Hills. The scattered towns and isolated homesteads of this frontier now face a dire threat. If the forces of Elemental Evil cant be defeated before they grow, madness and destruction could spread unchecked through the North.",
						"The presence of Elemental Evil in the Sumber Hills goes back thousands of years, when a sect of renegade drow discovered the extensive caverns beneath the Sumber Hills and claimed it as their territory. These dark elves venerated a terrible god of primordial evil, and they built a shrine to this nameless power. In time, the ancient drow cult faded away (or was wiped out), and the place known as the Temple of the Elder Elemental Eye was forgotten for centuries.",
						"The dwarves of Besilmer were the next folk to discover the site. Besilmer was a realm of pastures and cropland. The dwarves established an underground stronghold called Tyar-Besil beneath the Sumber Hills to defend against the trolls and giants that plagued the region. The dwarves discovered the ancient drow hold and its temple below their own delvings. They lacked the strength to clean out the ruins, so they abandoned their deeper excavations. Trolls and giants soon broke the realm of Besilmer, and the remaining dwarves abandoned the place altogether.",
						"Over the years, adventurers occasionally stumbled across the buried stronghold of Tyar-Besil and the drow vaults below it. Few made any lasting record of their explorations, and their names are forgotten. But in the year 893 DR (using the Dalereckoning calendar, about 600 years before the present day), a band of adventurers called the Knights of the Silver Horn found the place and commenced an exploration of the ruins. The adventurers came back to Tyar-Besil again and again, and when they decided to establish strongholds and tame the territory, they raised their keeps over each of the known access points leading to the ancient dwarven ruins. The adventurers feared something in the deep caves below the Sumber Hills, and they intended to set a permanent watch over the area.",
						"History didn't cooperate. A generation or two after the Knights of the Silver Horn established their strongholds, an orc horde swept through the North, and the keeps were overrun. For centuries they stood empty. Locals came to know them as the Haunted Keeps, and various monsters occasionally occupied the ruins.",
						"The abandoned keeps and the dwarven stronghold beneath them might have been forgotten forever, but a few years ago a drow named Vizeran DeVir returned to the ancient Fane of the Eye. A renegade drow wizard of great power, DeVir was no servant of Lolth; like the forgotten sect that created the temple long ago, he devoted himself to the nameless power of the Elder Elemental Eye. His beliefs led to his exile from drow society, but his faithfulness to this dark power did not go unrewarded. Guided by visions, Vizeran DeVir created four mighty weapons imbued with Elemental Evil: the spear {@item Windvane|PotA}, the dagger {@item Tinderstrike|PotA}, the trident {@item Drown|PotA}, and the war pick {@item Ironfang|PotA}. He left these weapons on the altar of the Elder Elemental Eye for their fated bearers to discover.",
						"Within the last few months, each of the four elemental prophets was driven to seek out the ancient altar by dreams or visions. One by one, {@creature Aerisi Kalinoth|PotA}, {@creature Vanifer|PotA}, {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|PotA}, and {@creature Marlos Urnrayle|PotA} claimed their weapons and became the leaders of their respective cults. The four prophets established themselves in the ruins of dwarven Tyar-Besil and occupied the Haunted Keeps that guard access to the vast dungeon. Lunatics, outlaws, power-hungry villains, and monsters of all description began to trickle into the valley, drawn by the dark call of Elemental Evil. Meanwhile, the prophets experimented with their new toys, nurturing the seeds of elemental nodes that grew larger every day and testing their powers to create ever-larger natural disasters.",
						"After thousands of years, the seeds of Elemental Evil once again sprout beneath the Sumber Hills. Whether anyone can expose these sinister plots and put a stop to them remains to be seen."

						"The adventure begins when the characters arrive in the town of Red Larch, a small settlement on the western side of the Dessarin Valley. Strange rumors and ominous signs have the townsfolk concerned, including reports of bandit attacks on the roads, piracy on the Dessarin River, and monster sightings too close to town. But the mystery that has keen observers of the region most concerned is the disappearance of a delegation traveling overland from the city of Mirabar to Waterdeep. The delegation stopped in the tiny village of Beliard, where the members mentioned their intent to visit sacred dwarven sites before continuing on to Goldenfields. They were last seen at the west end of the Stone Bridge, turning south to proceed overland through the heart of the Sumber Hills. It has now been almost a month, and the delegation never showed up at Goldenfields or any other outpost.",
						"Powerful factions have good reason to worry about the missing delegation. The Harpers are concerned about a noted dwarf historian who was part of the delegation. The Emerald Enclave wants to know what happened to a pouch of magical seeds one of the delegation members was bringing to Goldenfields. Even the Zhentarim are interested in trying to improve their relations with Mirabar by helping to solve the mystery. Whether the characters set out to search for the missing delegation or choose to investigate another lead, they soon find clues that lead them to the Haunted Keeps in the Sumber Hills. All of these are now occupied by strange new sects masquerading as harmless societies or reclusive orders, but these outposts serve Elemental Evil.",
						"When the characters infiltrate or defeat these disguised groups of cultists, they discover that each Haunted Keep guards a passage leading to a huge dungeon beneath the Sumber Hills, the new Temple of Elemental Evil. Here, the elemental cults have established themselves in the ruins of an ancient dwarven stronghold. They are building up their strength as they work to master elemental power. The characters come up against the elemental prophets and confront one of the four cult leaders, whose identity depends on which part of the temple the characters explore first.",
						"Even as the characters delve into the elemental temples, their successes provoke retaliation. The elemental prophets dispatch bands of cultists armed with devastation orbs-essentially bombs of elemental energy created from the elemental nodes-to unleash natural disasters throughout the Dessarin Valley, punishing everyone for the characters interference.",
						"Despite fierce opposition in the various elemental temples and the retribution of the offended cults, the characters succeed in rescuing some of the Mirabar delegates and driving out some or all of the cults from their newly established bases in Tyar-Besil. Unfortunately, other members of the delegation remain missing, and various other leads and mysteries remain unresolved. Worse yet, it quickly becomes clear that the elemental cults are on the brink of unleashing unthinkable disasters.",
						"As an elemental apocalypse grows nearer, the characters discover passages leading from the cult-controlled territory in Tyar-Besil to the far older (and more dangerous) caverns known as the Fane of the Eye, dug long ago by drow. Here they find the evil altar dedicated to the Elder Elemental Eye, where the characters confront another of the elemental prophets (again, the prophet they fight depends on which part of the dungeon they explore first). They also find passages leading into the ultimate sanctums of the cults: the elemental nodes known as the Black Geode, the Howling Caverns, the Plunging Torrents, and the Weeping Colossus.",
						"In the last stage of the adventure, the characters face the daunting task of pursuing the remaining two elemental prophets into their places of power. The most powerful and dedicated followers of each of the four cults guard these sanctums, which are infused with elemental energy and warped into strange reflections of the Elemental Planes. At the heart of each elemental node, the characters find a great portal that serves as a conduit from its associated elemental plane. Here the remaining cult leaders make their stands, and here the characters face the overwhelming power of the Princes of Elemental Evil. Victory might seem doubtful against such opponents, but clever and resourceful characters can find ways to destroy the portals instead of trying to slay these dire beings.",
						"With the portals shut, the elemental nodes revert to normal, and any surviving cultists scatter to the four winds. Their stronghold is destroyed and their leaders are dead; Elemental Evil is defeated in this world for now."

						"Elemental Evil perverts the natural elements, limiting them to aspects of destruction. This force wants to gain the power to tear down everything-morals, social structures, governments, the laws of nature-and reduce existence to a more elemental state, tainted with conflict and madness. Elemental Evil uses mortal servants as a means to this end.",
						"These hateful principles take two primary forms in the world. The first is corruption. Elemental Evil tempts the broken, the wronged, and the wicked with the power to strike back. It represents the worm in the apple, a hidden corruption that grows stronger over time as the natural order decays. Secret cults spring up, institutions are debased, and the fundamental laws governing the seasons begin to weaken. As Elemental Evil grows stronger, its corruption grows into the second form: madness. Cultists sink into insanity, lashing out at everything around them or destroying themselves in elemental cataclysms. Ruin rules as the forces of nature become instruments of destruction. A world in which Elemental Evil triumphed would exist only as an everlasting war of raging elements.",
						"Elemental Evil appears in different worlds throughout the many ages. This sinister force-the Elder Elemental Eye-is well hidden in Faerun. Individuals remain susceptible to its call: those lured by the promise of power, those who know only hate in their hearts, those whose minds are broken and therefore open to insinuation and dark whispers. These are the servants of Elemental Evil, and they can cause immeasurable harm if they aren't exposed and rooted out.",
						"Although destruction is the unifying principle of Elemental Evil, beings that serve this dark force don't necessarily adhere to that goal. Only the most unbalanced minds seek destruction for its own sake. Instead, the servants of Elemental Evil seek power through the destructive might of one of the elements of air, earth, fire, or water. This is the origin of the four elemental cults that together compose the worship of Elemental Evil.",
						"The cults operate independently of each other. Each believes that its favored element is the most powerful and most worthy of worship. Rank-and-file members of the air cult sneer at the idea that anyone could see something worth worshiping in elemental earth, fire, or water. Members of the other cults feel the same way about any cult but their own. Only the best-educated or most magically gifted members understand that a unifying principle underlies each elemental cult. Even then, they believe that their element should reign supreme.",
						"Despite these different goals and varying methods, the elemental cults are linked to each other by forces they don't fully understand. From world to world and age to age, the cults of Elemental Evil have risen again and again. Each time, the cultists of elemental air, earth, fire, and water are joined to the same dark fate.",
						"Throughout the adventure, characters have ample opportunity to see the symbol associated with each of the four cults. They could figure out how the four symbols connect to form a fifth symbol: that of the Elder Elemental Eye."

Beneath this sneering self-assurance lies a bitter being who loathes himself and holds everyone around him in contempt.",
								"Marlos began life as a human aristocrat, born into a wealthy Cormyrean family. He squandered his familys wealth on endless self-indulgence, seeking more questionable forms of entertainment through the years. The Urnrayle estate became known as a place of outrageous masquerades, bizarre banquets, and grotesque orgies. Marlos required his guests to don ugly or monstrous masks, thus ensuring that no ones beauty would outshine his own.",

As long as he wore the ring, his imperfections vanished and no one could resist his physical charms-until the day the ring transformed Marlos into a medusa. The horror of his fate drove Marlos mad. He fled his ancestral home, taking his collection of masks with him.",

A long stairway beneath a ruined monastery brought him to an ancient cavern with a hideous altar, upon which lay a war pick of iron. When the medusa claimed {@item Ironfang|PotA}, his purpose finally became clear to him. He established his lair in the dungeon nearby and began building the Cult of the Black Earth.",

Like a flood that seeks the weak point in a levee and then bursts through with ever-growing strength, water cultists are quick to sense an opening and then act to exploit it. This philosophy of pragmatism and opportunism means that the Crushing Wave is the most mercenary of the four elemental cults. Water cultists eagerly seek out rich prizes and use their ill-gotten loot to develop their schemes.",

Instead, they feign retreats, regroup, and launch new attacks, wearing down their foes like storm-driven waves eating away at a sandy beach. Almost all water cultists are excellent swimmers skilled at fighting in water, so they look for opportunities to surprise their enemies by using bodies of water to slip around or through defenses.",

Many cult hideouts are located near large bodies of water, and those that aren't feature hidden pools or wells in which cult members can immerse themselves. Water cultists prize water-breathing magic and seek it out for no other reason than to spend hours meditating underwater. Few cultists gain any profound insights from these exercises."

Nothing of note to the wider world has happened here for hundreds of years. The frontier long ago receded farther northward, leaving behind a quiet backwater littered with ruins. These days, the Dessarin Valley has little in common with the popular conception of the Savage Frontier. Winters are hard here, but the hordes of orcs and other hungry monsters are a long way off from these parts.",
				"If the Dessarin Valley isn't quite as wild and lawless as it once was, it's still lightly settled territory that serves as a route to distant lands. Residents in places such as Red Larch or Triboar boast that their humble settlements are \"the Gateway to the North.\" Through these lands pass hundreds of caravans and keelboats each year, linking the great ports of Waterdeep and Neverwinter with places such as Everlund, Mirabar, or Silverymoon. The steady caravan traffic breathes life into the towns of this area, supporting businesses in the settlements along the Long Road. Inns cater to travelers anxious to sleep safely within sturdy walls and enjoy good food by a warm fire instead of camping by the side of the road.",
				"In addition to catering to caravans and travelers heading to or from the far North, the Dessarin Valley is a breadbasket for the hungry populations of Waterdeep and Neverwinter. The farms and pastures of the area produce grain, livestock, poultry, apples, and hops, then ship them downriver (or drive them down the Long Road) to the coast. Few people become rich from farming, but farmers in the region do well for themselves provided the weather cooperates. (That's one reason why the unusual weather lately has been a concern.)",

						"While some truly ancient ruins in this area go back to the days of the first great elf kingdoms, none of these figure into the story of this adventure. The earliest realm that does is the shield dwarf kingdom of Besilmer, which was founded nearly six thousand years ago in -4420 DR. Its existence is so far back in the mists of history that only a handful of non-dwarf sages have even heard of it. Most people of the Dessarin Valley don't know Besilmer at all, but they are familiar with two of its works: the engineering marvel known as the Stone Bridge (described later in this chapter) and the crumbling ruins known as the Halls of the Hunting Axe.",
						"The realm of Besilmer was something rare: a dwarven kingdom built on the surface, with its strength measured in fields and pastures. It prospered for a time but was plagued by trolls and giants. The dwarves were obliged to build a stronghold underground, carving out the fortress-city of Tyar-Besil a century after Besilmers founding. Unfortunately for the dwarves, the realm collapsed after its king and founder died in battle. Most of the surviving dwarves sought safer lands. The dwarven city beneath the Sumber Hills was abandoned by -4160 DR and then forgotten.",
						"Tyar-Besil slumbered in darkness for many long centuries, occasionally discovered and occupied by monsters or ambitious miners, only to be abandoned again. It came to light again in 893 DR, when a group of adventurers who called themselves the Knights of the Silver Horn discovered the ruins. Over the next six years they returned again and again, eventually founding strongholds of their own to safeguard the hidden entrances to the sprawling dungeon.",
						"The knights had some success in clearing small domains in the wild Sumber Hills, but only a few years later the powerful orc realm of Uruth Ukrypt arose nearby, and the Dessarin Valley became a battlefield. Trouble followed on trouble: the Orcfastings War, the First and Second Trollwars, and finally a series of vicious drow raids. By the year 942 DR, human settlements in the Dessarin Valley had been all but wiped out, and the Knights of the Silver Horn were no more. Their strongholds crumbled into ruin and became known in later years as the Haunted Keeps. Eventually, no one remembered who built them or why.",
						"The current wave of settlement in and around the Dessarin Valley began after 1000 DR, coinciding with Waterdeeps growth from a warlords stronghold into a major city. The first small outposts that would grow into places such as Red Larch and Triboar were carved out of a wild and untamed land.

						"Six months ago, an insidious new threat began to grow in the area, unsuspected by the locals or any passing adventurers. Dreams and visions drew four elemental prophets, one by one, to the Fane of the Eye beneath the Sumber Hills. Each prophet began to gather like-minded followers. Strangers trickled into the Dessarin Valley in ones or twos. Some were already cultists of Elemental Evil, eager to build a place where they could openly practice their vile rites. Others were brutal thugs, power-hungry dabblers in forbidden magic, or fanatics lured by the call of evil. At first the cultists valued secrecy above all else, but as their numbers grew and they established their strongholds, they turned their attention to expanding their hold on the Dessarin Valley.",

Enemies that managed to fight their way down the Ancient Stair from the surface above were stopped in their tracks by the daunting defenses of the gate quarter. More than one reckless attack by orcs, trolls, or giants was driven back from the gate,. In time, those savage foes found other ways to attack the dwarves of the Sumber Hills, and the stronghold was finally abandoned.

Some of the lycanthropes and druids at Scarlet Moon Hall (described in chapter 3) might be shifters.",
										"Tweak the adventure's background to connect it to the Last War. Perhaps the four prophets are war refugees\u2014or war criminals. And they found themselves picking up their elemental weapons for the first time on the Day of Mourning."

						"If you've created a fantasy world of your own to serve as the setting for your Dungeons & Dragons game, it will work just fine for the Elemental Evil campaign. The servants of the Elder Elemental Eye might operate under different names or present themselves in new guises, but elemental corruption can strike any world at any time. Heroes are always be needed to drive back the forces of darkness and destruction.",
						"The events of {@i Princes of the Apocalypse} take place in a thinly settled frontier, far from any kind of central authority. There are no power groups that can easily contest the rise of the elemental prophets\u2014that's why the burden of action falls to the player characters. The easiest conversion is to take the whole Dessarin Valley and drop it into the map of your world. Locations such as Red Larch or the Sumber Hills are generic enough that they would fit in most D&D settings. You may want to rename deities or factions to the pantheon or power groups present in your campaign, but otherwise you can incorporate the adventure as written into a part of the world your player characters have not yet explored.",
						"Alternatively, you can find a suitable place in your world where you can arrange towns analogous to Red Larch, Womford, Beliard, and Westbridge in the vicinity of a desolate wilderness like the Sumber Hills. In this adventure, these towns are as much as 70 or 80 miles apart, but there is no reason you couldn't fit them in a much smaller area. As long as the towns are at least a day's travel from each other, you have enough wilderness to make moving from town to town a serious decision point for the players.",
						"The Sumber Hills are presented as an area of dry badlands, but they don't have to be hills in your campaign. A region of uninhabited moorland, a wide marsh or swamp, or even a dark and haunted forest would serve just as well as a setting for the cult outposts and the events described in the search for the missing delegation from Mirabar. Naturally, you should select a setting where old castles are likely to be reoccupied by sinister newcomers, and a huge old subterranean complex could underlie the mysterious ruins."
